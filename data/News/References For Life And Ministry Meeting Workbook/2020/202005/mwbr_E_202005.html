<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:3, 4) </span><span class="font2">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age, and he had a special robe made for him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font2">When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they began to hate him, and they could not speak peaceably to him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>w14</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 8/1 12-13</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>“Please Listen to This Dream”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible answers: “When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they began to hate him, and they could not speak peaceably to him.” (Genesis 37:4) Their jealousy may be understandable, but Joseph’s brothers were unwise to give in to that poisonous emotion. (Proverbs 14:30; 27:4) Have you ever found yourself seething with envy when someone received attention or honor that you wanted? Remember Joseph’s brothers. Their jealousy led them to commit deeds that they would come to regret deeply. Their example serves to remind Christians that it is far wiser to “rejoice with those who rejoice.”—Romans 12:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Joseph surely sensed his brothers’ animosity. So did he stash his fancy robe out of sight when his brothers were near? He might have been tempted to do so. Remember, though, that Jacob wanted the robe to be a sign of favor and love. Joseph wanted to live up to his father’s trust in him, so he loyally wore the garment. His example is useful for us. Although our own heavenly Father is never partial, he does at times single out his loyal servants and favor them. Furthermore, he asks them to stand out as different from this corrupt and immoral world. Like Joseph’s special robe, the conduct of true Christians makes them different from those around them. Such conduct sometimes incites jealousy and animosity. (1 Peter 4:4) Should a Christian hide his true identity as a servant of God? No—no more than Joseph should have hidden his robe.—Luke 11:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:5-9) </span><span class="font2">Later Joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers, and they found further reason to hate him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font2">He said to them: “Please listen to this dream that I had. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font2">There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field when my sheaf got up and stood erect and your sheaves encircled and bowed down to my sheaf.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font2">His brothers said to him: “Are you really going to make yourself king over us and dominate us?” So they found another reason to hate him, because of his dreams and what he said. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font2">After that he had still another dream, and he related it to his brothers: “I have had another dream. This time the sun and the moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:11) </span><span class="font2">And his brothers grew jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>w14 8/1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 13 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2-4</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Please Listen to This Dream”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The dreams came from Jehovah God. They were prophetic in nature, and God meant for Joseph to pass along the message they contained. In a sense, Joseph was to do what all the later prophets did when they related God’s messages and judgments to His wayward people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Joseph tactfully said to his brothers: “Please listen to this dream that I had.” His brothers understood the dream, and they did not like it one bit. They answered: “Are you really going to make yourself king over us and dominate us?” The account adds: “So they found another reason to hate him, because of his dreams and what he said.” When Joseph related the second dream to his father as well as his brothers, the reaction was not much better. We read: “His father rebuked him and said to him: ‘What is the meaning of this dream of yours? Am I as well as your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the earth to you?’ ” However, Jacob kept thinking the matter over. Might Jehovah be communicating with the boy? —Genesis 37:6, 8, 10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Joseph was neither the first nor the last servant of Jehovah to be asked to relay a prophetic message that would prove to be unpopular and even lead to persecution. Jesus was the greatest of such message bearers, and he told his followers: “If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” (John 15:20) Christians of all ages may learn much from the faith and courage of young Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:23, 24) </span><span class="font2">So as soon as Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his robe, the special robe that he wore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> </span><span class="font2">and they took him and threw him into the waterpit. At the time the pit was empty; there was no water in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:28) </span><span class="font2">And when the MidTandte merchants were passing by, they lifted Joseph up out of the waterpit and sold him to the Ish</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">ma^eHtes for 20 pieces of silver. These men took Joseph into Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 36:1) </span><span class="font2">This is the history of E</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">sau, that is, E</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">dom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">(E</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">dom) [Red], </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Edomites </span><span class="font1">(E</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">domjtes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Edom was the secondary name or byname given to Esau, Jacob’s twin brother. (Ge 36:1) It was applied to him because of his selling his birthright for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">red</span><span class="font1"> stew. (Ge 25:30-34) Coincidentally, Esau at birth had had a very red color (Ge 25:25), and a similar color prevailed in parts of the land he and his descendants later inhabited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 37:29-32) </span><span class="font2">Later when Reu</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">ben returned to the waterpit and saw that Joseph was not in the waterpit, he ripped his garments apart. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font2">When he returned to his brothers, he exclaimed: “The child is gone! And I—what am I going to do?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> </span><span class="font2">So they took Joseph’s robe and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the robe in the blood. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>32</sup> </span><span class="font2">After that they sent the special robe to their father and said: “This is what we found. Please examine whether this is your son’s robe or not.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>it</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 561-562</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Custody</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">When a shepherd or herdsman said he would keep or guard a flock or herd, he was indicating legal acceptance of the custody of these animals. He was guaranteeing the owner that they would be fed and not stolen, or else compensation would be paid. However, his responsibility was not absolute, for the above law absolved the guardian of liability in the case of an occurrence beyond normal human control, such as attack by wild beasts. To be relieved of the responsibility of custody, though, he had to submit evidence to the owner, as, for example, the torn carcass. The owner, on examination of such evidence, was bound to return a verdict of innocence on the part of the custodian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same principle applied in general to any entrusted property, even in family relationships, for example, the oldest brother was considered the legal guardian of his younger brothers and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sisters. Hence, we can understand the concern that Reuben as an eldest son had for Joseph’s life, as recorded at Genesis 37:18-30, when the other brothers spoke of killing him. “He said: ‘Let us not strike his soul fatally.’ . . . ‘Do not spill blood.... do not lay a violent hand upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">him.’ His purpose was to deliver him out of their hand in order to return him to his father.” And when Reuben discovered Joseph’s absence, his anxiety was so extreme that “he ripped his garments apart” and exclaimed: “The child is gone! And I—where am I really to go?” He knew that he could be held accountable for the loss of Joseph. To escape responsibility, the brothers shrewdly fabricated evidence to the effect that Joseph had been killed by a wild beast. This they did by soaking Joseph’s striped garment in goat’s blood. They then submitted this evidence to Jacob, their father and patriarchal judge, who absolved Reuben of any responsibility because, on the basis of Joseph’s blood-soaked garment that his brothers presented as evidence, Jacob concluded that Joseph had been killed.—Ge 37:31-33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and an Egyptian named Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh and chief of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.” (Genesis 39:1) In those few words, the Bible account helps us to imagine the humiliation of a young man as he was sold once again. He was mere property! We may think of Joseph following his new master, an Egyptian court official, through bustling city streets crowded with bazaars as they head toward Joseph’s new home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Home! It was a far cry from anything Joseph had ever called home. He had grown up in a nomadic family who dwelled in tents as they moved frequently and tended their flocks of sheep. Here, such wealthy Egyptians as Potiphar lived in elegant, brightly painted houses. Archaeologists report that the ancient Egyptians were fond of lush, walled gardens with shade trees and quiet pools for growing papyrus, lotus, and other water plants. Some houses sat secluded within gardens, with porches for enjoying the breeze, high windows for ventilation, and many rooms, including a large dining room and quarters for servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 39:12-14) </span><span class="font2">Then she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said: “Lie down with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled outside. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font2">As soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font2">she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them: “Look! He brought to us this Hebrew man to make us a laughingstock. He came to me to lie down with me, but I began to cry out at the top of my voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 39:20) </span><span class="font2">So Joseph’s master took him and gave him over to the prison, the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest, and he remained there in the prison.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>w14</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11/1 14-15</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>“How Could I Commit This Great Badness?”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">We know little of what Egyptian prisons were like in those days. Archaeologists have found the ruins of such places—great fortresslike structures with cells and dungeons. Joseph later described the place with a word that literally means “the pit,” which suggests a lightless and hopeless place. (Genesis 40:15, footnote) In the book of Psalms, we learn that Joseph was subjected to further torment: “With fetters they bound his feet; his neck was put in irons.” (Psalm 105:17, 18) The Egyptians sometimes put prisoners in restraints that pinioned their arms behind them at the elbows; others bore iron collars clasped at their necks. How Joseph must have suffered to be so mistreated—when he had done nothing to deserve it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is more, this was no brief setback. The account says that Joseph “remained there in the prison.” He spent years in that terrible place! And Joseph did not know if he would ever be released. As those first shocking days dragged into weeks, then months, how did he keep from falling into hopelessness and despair?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The account gives us this reassuring answer: “Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him.” (Genesis 39:21) No prison walls, no fetters, no lightless dungeons can keep Jehovah’s loyal love from reaching his servants. (Romans 8:38, 39) We may well imagine Joseph pouring out his agony to his dear heavenly Father in prayer and then receiving the kind of peace and calm that only “the God of all comfort” can provide. (2 Corinthians 1:3, 4; Phi-lippians 4:6, 7) What else did Jehovah do for Joseph? We read that he kept granting Joseph “favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">A son of Judah, his second by the Canaanite daughter of Shua. (Ge 38:2-4; 1Ch 2:3) After Onan’s childless older brother Er was put to death by Jehova h for wrongdoing, Onan was told by Judah to perform brother-in-law marriage with Er’s widow Tamar. If a son was produced, he would not be the founder of Onan’s family, and the firstborn’s inheritance would belong to him as an heir to Er; whereas if no heir came, Onan would get the inheritance for himself. When Onan had relations with Tamar, he “wasted his semen on the earth” instead of giving it to her. This was not an act of masturbation on the part of Onan, for the account says “when he did have relations with his brother’s wife” he spilled his semen. Apparently it was a case of “coitus interruptus,” in which Onan purposely prevented ejaculation of his semen into Tamar’s genital tract. For his disobedience to his father, his covetousness, and his sin against the divine arrangement of marriage, not for self-abuse, Onan, himself also childless, was put to death by Jehovah.—Ge 38: 6-10; 46:12; Nu 26:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Judah acted wrongly in that he did not give Tamar to his son Shelah as promised. He also had relations with a woman he thought was a temple prostitute. This was contrary to God’s purpose, which was for a man to have sexual relations only in the marriage arrangement. (Genesis 2:24) In reality, though, Judah did not have relations with a harlot. Rather, he unwittingly took the place of his son Shelah in performing brother-in-law marriage and thus fathered legal offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As for Tamar, her course was not an immoral one. Her twin sons were not considered to be the sons of fornication. When Boaz of Bethlehem took the Moabitess Ruth in brother-in-law marriage, the elders of Bethlehem spoke favorably of Tamar’s son Perez, saying to Boaz: “May your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, from the offspring that Jehovah will give you out of this young woman.” (Ruth 4:12) Perez is also listed among the ancestors of Jesus Christ.—Matthew 1:1-3; Luke 3:23-33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Do Not Interpretations Belong to God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cupbearer may have forgotten Joseph, but Jehovah never did. One night, he sent Pharaoh a pair of unforgettable dreams. In the first, the king saw seven fine-looking, fat cows emerge from the Nile River, followed by seven ugly, thin cows. The thin ones devoured the fat ones. Later, Pharaoh dreamed that he saw a stalk of grain sprouting seven choice ears. But then another seven ears, wind-parched and sickly, sprouted up and devoured the choice ones. In the morning, Pharaoh awoke deeply agitated over the dreams, so he called on all his wise men and magic-practicing priests to interpret them. They all failed. (Genesis 41:1-8) Whether that means that they were dumbfounded or that they came up with a variety of conflicting ideas, we do not know. At any rate, Pharaoh was let down—yet he was more desperate than ever to find an answer to this puzzle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, the cupbearer remembered Joseph! His conscience stung him, and he told Pharaoh about the remarkable young man in prison who two years earlier had correctly interpreted his dream and that of the baker. Immediately, Pharaoh had Joseph summoned from prison. —Genesis 41:9-13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 41:29-32) </span><span class="font2">“There are to be seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font2">But seven years of famine will certainly arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten, and the famine will exhaust the land. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> </span><span class="font2">And the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine afterward, for it will be very severe. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>32</sup> </span><span class="font2">The dream was given twice to Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true God, and the true God will soon carry it out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Do Not Interpretations Belong to God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah loves humble, faithful people, so it is no wonder that he gave Joseph the answer that had eluded the wise men and priests. Joseph explained that Pharaoh’s two dreams had the same meaning. By repeating the message, Jehovah was signifying that the matter was “firmly established”—absolutely sure of fulfillment. The fat cows and the healthy ears of grain represented seven years of plenty in Egypt, while the lean cows and the sickly ears of grain pictured seven years of famine that would follow the years of plenty. That famine would devour the land’s abundance.—Genesis 41:25-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 41:38-40) </span><span class="font2">So Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh said to his servants: “Can another man be found like this one in whom there is the spirit of God?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>39</sup> </span><span class="font2">Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh then said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all of this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>40</sup> </span><span class="font2">You will personally be over my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do Not Interpretations Belong to God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pharaoh was as good as his word. Joseph was soon clothed in fine linen. Pharaoh gave him a gold necklace, a signet ring, a royal chariot, and full authority to travel through the land and put his plan into effect. (Genesis 41:42-44) Within the space of a day, then, Joseph went from prison to palace. He awoke a lowly convict, and he fell asleep as the ruler second to Pharaoh. How clear that Joseph’s faith in Jehovah God was justified! Jehovah saw all the injustices that his servant had suffered through the years. He addressed those issues at just the right time and in just the right way. Jehovah had in mind not only correcting the wrongs done to Joseph but also preserving the future nation of Israel. We will see how that was so in a future article in this series.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Why did Joseph shave before seeing Pharaoh? </span><span class="font1">According to the Genesis account, Pharaoh ordered that the Hebrew prisoner Joseph be quickly brought before him to interpret his troubling dreams. By this time, Joseph had been imprisoned for a number of years. Despite the urgency of Pharaoh’s summons, Joseph took the time to shave. (Genesis 39:20-23; 41:1, 14) That the writer mentions this seemingly insignificant detail at all shows that he was familiar with Egyptian customs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Letting one’s beard grow was the norm among many ancient nations, including the Hebrews.

<p><span class="font1">Was shaving limited to the beard?

When imprisoned, he was courteous even to his fellow prisoners.

Please show me loyal love and mention me to Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">-aoh, in order to get me out of this place. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">I was, in fact, kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good, he said to him: “I too was in my dream, and there were three baskets of white bread on my head, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">and in the top basket, there were all sorts of baked goods for Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh, and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font2">Three days from now, Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh will behead you and will hang you on a stake, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font2">Now the third day was Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh’s birthday, and he made a feast for all his servants, and he brought out both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font2">And he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer, and he continued to hand the cup to Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font2">But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> </span><span class="font2">However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he kept forgetting him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Am I in the Place of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What about Joseph? He recognized his brothers right away! What is more, when he saw them there bowing before him, his thoughts flew back to his boyhood. The account tells us that “Joseph immediately remembered the dreams” that Jehovah had given him when he was but a boy, dreams foretelling a time when his brothers would be bowing low before him—exactly as they now were! (Genesis 37:2, 5-9; 42:7, 9) What would Joseph do? Embrace them? Take revenge?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Am I in the Place of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You are not likely ever to find yourself in that unusual position. However, strife and division within the family are common in today’s world. When we face such challenges, we may tend simply to follow our heart and act on our imperfect impulses. It is much wiser to imitate Joseph and try to discern how God wants us to handle matters. (Proverbs 14:12) Remember, as important as it is to make peace with family members, peace with Jehovah and his Son is even more vital.—Matthew 10:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 42:14-17) </span><span class="font2">However, Joseph said to them: “It is just as I said to you—‘You are spies!’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">By this you will be tested: As surely as Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh lives, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">Send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in bondage.

And if not, then, as surely as Phar</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">aoh lives, you are spies.”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">With that he put them together in custody for three days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Am I in the Place of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Joseph launched into a series of tests designed to reveal who his brothers were at heart. He started by speaking to them harshly, through an interpreter, accusing them of being foreign spies. To defend themselves, they told him about their family—including the key fact that they had a younger brother still at home. Joseph tried to hide his excitement. Was his little brother really alive? Now Joseph knew how to proceed. He said: “By this you will be tested,” and then he told them that he must see this youngest brother. In time, he agreed to let them return home to fetch the youngest if one of them would agree to remain behind as a hos-tage.—Genesis 42:9-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 42:21, 22) </span><span class="font2">And they said to one another: “We are surely being punished on account of our brother, because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion, but we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Reu</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font2">ben answered them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the child,’ but you would not listen? Now his blood is certainly being asked back.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joseph</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of these developments, Joseph’s half brothers began to sense divine retribution on them for having sold him into slavery years earlier. In front of their brother, whom they still did not recognize, they discussed their guilt. On overhearing their words reflecting repentance, Joseph was so emotionally overcome that he had to leave their presence and weep. On returning, he had Simeon bound until such time as they would come back with their youngest brother.—Ge 42:21-24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Some of Reuben’s good qualities displayed themselves when he persuaded his nine brothers to throw Joseph into a dry well instead of killing him, Reuben intending to return secretly and deliver Joseph out of the well. (Ge 37:1830) More than 20 years later when these same brothers reasoned that the spy charges against them down in Egypt were due to their mistreatment of Joseph, Reuben reminded the others that he had not shared in their plot on Joseph’s life. (Ge 42:9-14, 21, 22) Again, when Jacob refused to let Benjamin accompany his brothers on their second trip to Egypt, it was Reuben who offered his own two sons as surety, saying: “You may put [them] to death if I do not bring [Benjamin] back to you.”—Ge 42:37.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 42:1-20) </span><span class="font2">When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons: “Why do you just keep looking at one another?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font2">He added: “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.

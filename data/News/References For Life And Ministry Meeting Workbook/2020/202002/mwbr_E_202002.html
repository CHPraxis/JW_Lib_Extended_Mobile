<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Covenant With Abraham. </span><span class="font1">The covenant with Abraham apparently went into effect when Abram (Abraham) crossed the Euphrates on his way to Canaan. The Law covenant was made 430 years later. (Ga 3:17) Jehovah had spoken to Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, in Ur of the Chaldeans, telling him to travel to the country that God would show him. (Ac 7:2, 3; Ge 11:31; 12:1-3) Exodus 12:40, 41 (</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">LXX</span><span class="font1">) tells us that at the end of 430 years of dwelling in Egypt and in the land of Canaan, “on this very day” Israel, who had been in slavery in Egypt, went out. The day they were delivered from Egypt was Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E., the date of the Passover. (Ex 12:2, 6, 7) This would seem to indicate that Abraham crossed the Euphrates River on his way to Canaan on Nisan 14, 1943 B.C.E., and evidently that is when the Abrahamic covenant took effect. God appeared to Abraham again after he had traveled into Canaan as far as Shechem and enlarged on the promise, saying, “To your </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">seed</span><span class="font1"> I am going to give this land,” thereby giving an indication of the connection of this covenant with the promise in Eden, and revealing that the “seed” would take a human course, that is, would run through a human line of descent. (Ge 12:4-7) Other enlargements by Jehovah were later expressed, as recorded at Genesis 13:14-17; 15:18; 17:2-8, 19; 22:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 12:3) </span><span class="font2">I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who calls down evil on you, and all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed by means of you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Why You Should Know the Truth About Abraham</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That is a staggering promise, and Abraham heard it uttered on at least two other occasions. (Genesis 18:18; 22:18) In order to fulfill it, God will even resurrect from the dead representatives of families that have died out. Life for such resurrected ones will truly be a blessing, since most of them will come back to an earthly situation resembling the Paradise that man originally lost. Thereafter, they will be taught how to gain the blessing of everlasting life.—Genesis 2:8, 9, 15-17; 3:17-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 13:14-17) </span><span class="font2">Jehovah said to A</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">bram, after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, to the north and south, east and west, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">because all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">And I will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth, then your offspring could be counted. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">Get up, travel through the length and breadth of the land, for to you I am going to give it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">On the basis of related historical evidence, some scholars believe that, in transferring land, the buyer was shown the land from a vantage point, the exact boundaries being designated. When the buyer said, “I see,” he indicated legal acceptance. When Jehovah gave Abraham the promise of receiving the land of Canaan, Abraham was first told to look in all four directions. Abraham did not say, “I see,” perhaps because God said that he would give the Promised Land to Abraham’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">seed,</span><span class="font1"> later on. (Ge 13:14, 15) Moses, as the legal representative of Israel, was told to “see” the land, which, if the view just discussed is correct, would indicate legal transfer of the land to Israel, for them to take it under Joshua’s leadership. (De 3:27, 28; 34:4; consider also Satan’s offer to Jesus at Mt 4:8.) Another action appearing to have similar legal flavor was: walking across the land or entering it for the purpose of taking possession. (Ge 13: 17; 28:13) In certain ancient documents, the number of trees on a piece of land was listed at each real-estate sale.—Compare Ge 23:17, 18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Settle Differences in a Spirit of Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">A Scriptural account in which God’s servants peacefully resolved a potentially divisive issue is the one mentioned earlier involving Abraham and his nephew Lot. Both men possessed livestock, and their shepherds apparently quarreled about grazing land. Eager to eliminate tensions, Abraham offered Lot first choice of the areas where their respective households would settle. (Gen. 13:1, 2, 5-9) What a good example! Abraham sought peace, not his own interests. Did he lose out because of his generosity? Not at all. Immediately after this incident with Lot, Jehovah promised Abraham great blessings. (Gen. 13:14-17) God will never allow his servants to suffer lasting loss for acting in harmony with divine principles and settling differences in a spirit of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 14:18-20) </span><span class="font2">And Mebchiz</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">e^dek king of Sa</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">lem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of the Most High God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then he blessed him and said: “Blessed be A</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">bram by the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font2">And praised be the Most High God, Who has handed your oppressors over to you!” And A</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">bram gave him a tenth of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 7:4-10) </span><span class="font2">See how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head, gave a tenth out of the best spoils. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font2">True, according to the Law, those of the sons of Le</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">vi who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though these are descendants of Abraham. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font2">But this man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font2">Now it is undeniable that the lesser one is blessed by the greater. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font2">And in the one case, it is men who are dying who receive tithes, but in the other case, it is someone of whom witness is given that he lives.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font2">And it could be said that even Le</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">vi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font2">for he was still a future descendant of his forefather when Mehchiz</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">e^dek met him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Priest</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Melchizedek king of Salem was a priest (</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ko-hen'</span><span class="font1">) extraordinary. The Bible gives no record of his ancestry, his birth, or his death. His priesthood was not by inheritance, and he had no predecessors or successors in office. Melchize-dek held both the office of king and of priest. His priesthood was greater than the Levitical priesthood, for Levi, in effect, paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was still in the loins of Abraham when Abraham offered tithes to Mel-chizedek and was blessed by him. (Ge 14:1820; Heb 7:4-10) In these things Melchizedek foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the “priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.”—Heb 7:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">On the other hand, man’s ways and productions are often faulty. Sin and error are the legacy all men have inherited from Adam. (Ro 5:12; Ps 51:5) But Jehovah, himself faultless, “well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust,” and is merciful. (Ps 103: 13, 14) He regarded faithful, obedient Noah as “faultless among his contemporaries.” (Ge 6:9) He commanded Abraham, “Walk before me and prove yourself faultless.” (Ge 17:1) Although both these men were imperfect and died, they were viewed as faultless by Jehovah, who “sees what the heart is.” (1Sa 16:7; compare 2Ki 20:3; 2Ch 16:9.) He commanded Israel: “You should prove yourself faultless with Jehovah your God.” (De 18:13; 2Sa 22:24) He provided his faultless Son (Heb 7:26) as a ransom sacrifice, and on this basis He can call those exercising faith and obedience “righteous,” or faultless, while at the same time maintaining his position as the righteous and faultless Judge.—Ro 3:25, 26; see INTEGRITY; PERFECTION.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Time passed. They had now been in Canaan for about ten years, yet Sarah continued barren. She therefore proposed to substitute her Egyptian maidservant Hagar so that she might have a child by her. Abraham consented. And so in 1932 B.C.E., when Abraham was 86 years old, Ishmael was born. (Ge 16:3, 15, 16) More time passed. In 1919 B.C.E., when Abraham was 99 years old, as a sign or seal to testify to the special covenant relationship existing between himself and Abraham, Jehovah commanded that all the males of Abraham’s household be circumcised. At the same time Jehovah changed his name from Abram to Abraham, “because a father of a crowd of nations I will make you.” (Ge 17:5, 9-27; Ro 4:11) Soon after, three materialized angels, whom Abraham received hospitably in the name of Jehovah, promised that Sarah herself would conceive and give birth to a son, yes, within the coming year!—Ge 18: 1-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 17: 15, 16) </span><span class="font2">Then God said to Abraham: “As for your wife Sar</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ai, you must not call her Sar</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ai, because Sarah will become her name. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">I will bless her and also give you a son by her; I will bless her and she will become nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">God himself changed the names of certain adults for prophetic purposes. For example, he changed the name of Abram, meaning “Father Is Exalted,” to Abraham, meaning “Father of a Multitude.” True to his name, Abraham did become the father of many nations. (Genesis 17:5, 6) Consider, too, Abraham’s wife, Sarai, possibly meaning “Contentious.” How happy she must have been when God renamed her “Sarah,” meaning “Princess,” alluding to her becoming an ancestress of kings.—Genesis 17: 15, 16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Jehovah told Abram (Abraham): “You may know for sure that your seed will become an alien resident in a land not theirs, and they will have to serve them, and these will certainly afflict them for four hundred years.” (Ge 15:13; see also Ac 7:6, 7.) This was stated prior to the birth of the promised heir or “seed,” Isaac. In 1932 B.C.E. Ishmael was born to Abram by the Egyptian servant girl Hagar, and in 1918 B.C.E. Isaac was born. (Ge 16:16; 21:5) Counting back 400 years from the Exodus, which marked the end of the ‘afflicting’ (Ge 15:14), would bring us to 1913 B.C.E., and at that time Isaac was about five years old. It appears that Isaac was weaned then and, already “an alien resident” in a land not his, he now experienced the start of the foretold affliction in the form of Ishmael’s “poking fun,” Ishmael being about 19. (Ge 21:8, 9) Although in modern times Ishmael’s mocking of Abraham’s heir might be viewed as inconsequential, such was not the case in patriarchal times. This is evidenced by Sarah’s reaction and God’s approval of her insistence that Hagar and her son Ishmael be sent away. (Ge 21:10-13) The very fact that this incident was recorded in detail in the divine record also points to its marking the commencement of the prophesied 400-year period of affliction that would not end until the Exodus.—Ga 4:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“In the fourth generation.”</span><span class="font1"> We must remember that Jehovah told Abraham that in the fourth generation his descendants would return to Canaan. (Ge 15:16) In the entire 430 years from the time when the Abrahamic covenant took effect to the Exodus there were more than four generations, even considering the long life spans that they enjoyed during that time, according to the record. But it was only 215 years that the Israelites were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">actually in Egypt.</span><span class="font1"> The ‘four generations’ following their entering Egypt can be calculated in this way, using as an example just one tribe of Israel, the tribe of Levi: (1) Levi, (2) Kohath, (3) Amram, and (4) Moses. —Ex 6:16, 18, 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘The Judge of All the Earth’ Destroys Sodom and Gomorrah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 18:23-25) </span><span class="font2">Then Abraham approached and said: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> </span><span class="font2">Suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city. Will you, then, sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50 righteous who are inside it? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font2">It is unthinkable that you would act in this manner by putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one so that the outcome for the righteous man and the wicked is the same!

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Judge of All the Earth” Always Does What Is Right</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?” (Gen. 18:25) With that question, Abraham expressed confidence that Jehovah would render perfect justice in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham was convinced that Jehovah would never act unjustly by “putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one.” Such an act was “unthinkable” to Abraham. Some 400 years later, Jehovah said of himself: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.” —Deut. 31:19; 32:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 18:32) </span><span class="font2">Finally he said: “Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger, but let me speak just once more: Suppose only ten are found there.” He answered: “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Patience—Endurance With a Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, when it comes to exercising patience, Jehovah is the most outstanding example for us to follow. (2 Pet. 3:15) There are many accounts in God’s Word of times when Jehovah displayed great patience. (Neh. 9:30; Isa. 30:18) For instance, how did Jehovah react when Abraham questioned His decision to destroy Sodom? First of all, Jehovah did not interrupt as Abraham spoke. Instead, Jehovah listened patiently to each of Abraham’s questions and concerns. Then, Jehovah showed that he had listened as he repeated Abraham’s concerns and assured him that He would not destroy Sodom even if just ten righteous men were found in that city. (Gen. 18:22-33) What a fine example of patient listening and of not overreacting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 19:24, 25) </span><span class="font2">Then Jehovah made it rain sulfur and fire on Sod</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">om and Gomor</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">-rah—it came from Jehovah, from the heavens. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font2">So he overthrew these cities, yes, the entire district, including all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah Is Our Sovereign Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font1"> We can be certain that Jehovah will soon assert his sovereignty. He will not endlessly tolerate wickedness, and we know that we are living in the last days. Jehovah took action against the wicked during the Flood. He destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and Pharaoh and his forces. Sisera and his army and Sennacherib and his Assyrian troops were no match for the Most High. (Gen. 7:1, 23; 19:24, 25; Ex. 14: 30, 31; Judg. 4:15, 16; 2 Ki. 19:35, 36) We can therefore be confident that Jehovah God will not indefinitely put up with disrespect for his name and mistreatment of his Witnesses. Furthermore, we now see evidence of the sign of Jesus’ presence and of the conclusion of this wicked system of things.—Matt. 24:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Has Anyone Seen God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now it is possible to understand why Abraham addressed the materialized angelic spokesman of God as if he were talking to Jehovah God himself. Since this angel spoke precisely what God wanted to have said to Abraham and was there personally representing Him, the Biblical record could say that “Jehovah appeared to him.”—Genesis 18:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that an angelic spokesman for God could transmit His messages just as precisely as a telephone or a radio can transmit our words to another person. Hence, it can be understood how Abraham, Moses, Manoah, and others could speak with a materialized angel as if they were talking to God. While such individuals were able to see these angels and the glory of Jehovah reflected by them, they were not able to see God. Therefore, this in no way contradicts the apostle John’s statement: “No man has seen God at any time.” (John 1:18) What these men saw were angelic representatives and not God himself.</span></p>

(Gen. 13:8-13; 14:12) His wife apparently became so attached to the city or to some of the people living there that she disobeyed Jehovah. She lost her life when God rained fire and sulfur on the region. And think of Lot’s two daughters. They were engaged to men who died in Sodom. Lot lost his home, his possessions and, most painful of all, his wife. (Gen. 19:1214, 17, 26) During this stressful period, did Jehovah lose patience with Lot? No.</span></p>

When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then he said: “Jehovah, if I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font2">Please, let a little water be brought and have your feet washed; then recline under the tree. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font2">Seeing that you have come here to your servant, let me bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves.

Sarah was past the age of childbearing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font2">So Sarah began to laugh to herself, saying: “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I really have this pleasure?” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Jehovah said to Abraham: “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Am I really going to give birth even though I am old?’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font2">Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah?

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 21:1-3) </span><span class="font2">Jehovah turned his attention to Sarah just as he had said, and Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font2">So Sarah became pregnant and then bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time God had promised him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font2">Abraham named his newborn son, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>God Called Her “Princess”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Was Sarah’s laughter evidence that she lacked faith? Not at all. The Bible says: “By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring, even when she was past the age, since she considered Him faithful who made the promise.” (Hebrews 11:11) Sarah knew Jehovah; she knew that he could fulfill any promise that he made. Who of us does not need more faith of that kind? We do well to get to know the God of the Bible better. As we do, we will see that Sarah was right to have the faith that she did. Jehovah truly is faithful and carries out his every prom-ise—at times, he might even do so in ways that surprise us into amazed or incredulous laughter!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>“LISTEN TO HER”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">At 90 years of age, Sarah finally got to relish the moment she had longed for all her adult life. She bore a son to her beloved husband, now a century old! Abraham named the baby Isaac, or “Laughter,” just as God had said. We may picture Sarah’s weary but glowing smile as she explained: “God has brought me laughter; everybody hearing of it will laugh with me.” (Genesis 21:6) This miraculous gift from Jehovah surely delighted her till the end of her days. However, it also brought her great responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Isaac was five years old, the family held a feast to mark the occasion of the weaning of the child. But not all was well. We read that Sarah “kept noticing” a troubling pattern of behavior. Ishmael, the 19-year-old son of Hagar, kept mocking little Isaac. This was not mere playful teasing. The apostle Paul was later inspired to call Ishmael’s behavior persecution. Sarah saw this bullying for what it was: a serious threat to the well-being of her son. Sarah knew well that Isaac was more than just her son; he was assigned a key role in Jehovah’s purpose. So she mustered up courage and spoke forthrightly to Abraham. She asked him to send Hagar and Ishmael away.—Genesis 21:8-10; Galatians 4:22, 23, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How did Abraham respond? We read: “What she said about his son was very displeasing to Abraham.” He was fond of Ishmael, and he could not see past his own fatherly emotions on this issue. However, Jehovah saw the matter clearly, so he intervened. We read: “Then God said to Abraham: ‘Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl. Listen to her, for what will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.’” Jehovah assured Abraham that Hagar and the boy would be provided for. Faithful Abraham com-plied.—Genesis 21:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 21:5-7) </span><span class="font2">Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Sarah said: “God has brought me laughter; everybody hearing of it will laugh with me.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font2">And she added: “Who would have said to Abraham, ‘Sarah will certainly nurse children’? Yet, I have given birth to a son for him in his old age.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 21:10-12) </span><span class="font2">So she said to Abraham: “Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir along with my son, with Isaac!” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font2">But what she said about his son was very displeasing to Abraham. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then God said to Abraham: “Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 21:14) </span><span class="font2">So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to Ha</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">gar.

<p><span class="font1">Sarah was the half sister of Abraham. Terah was father to both of them, but they had different mothers. (Genesis 20:12) While such a marriage is improper today, it is important to keep in mind how different things were back then. Humans were closer to the perfection that Adam and Eve had enjoyed but lost. For such robust people, marriage between close relatives evidently did not present genetic dangers to offspring. Some 400 years later, though, life spans were similar to ours. At that time, the Mosaic Law outlawed all sexual unions between close relatives.—Leviticus 18:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Abram responded with another act of faith. As the account says: “He built an altar there to Jehovah.” (Genesis 12:7) Likely, this included offering up an animal sacrifice, for the Hebrew word for “altar” means “place of sacrifice.” Later, Abram repeated these acts of faith in other parts of the land. In addition, he ‘called on the name of Jehovah.’ (Genesis 12:8; 13:18; 21: 33) The Hebrew phrase “call on the name” also means “declare (preach) the name.” Abram’s household as well as the Canaanites must have heard him boldly declare the name of his God, Jehovah. (Genesis 14:22-24) Likewise, all who seek God’s friendship today must call upon his name in faith. This would include sharing in public preaching, “always offer[ing] to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.”—Hebrews 13:15; Romans 10:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 20:1-18) </span><span class="font2">Now Abraham moved his camp from there to the land of the Neg</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">-eb and began dwelling between Ka</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">desh and Shur. While he was residing at Ge</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">rar,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font2">Abraham repeated concerning his wife Sarah: “She is my sister.” So A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech king of Ge</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">rar sent for Sarah and took her. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font2">Afterward, God came by night to A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech in a dream and said to him: “Here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken, since she is married and belongs to another man.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font2">However, A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">-edech had not gone near her. So he said: “Jehovah, will you kill a nation that is really innocent? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font2">Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and did she too not say, ‘He is my brother’? I did this with an honest heart and innocent hands.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then the true God said to him in the dream: “I know that you did this with an honest heart, so I held you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font2">Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you and you will keep living. But if you are not returning her, know that you will surely die, you and all who are yours.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font2">A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things, and they became very frightened. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech called Abraham and said to him: “What have you done to us? What sin have I committed against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin? What you have done to me was not right.”</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font2">And A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech went on to say to Abraham: “What were your intentions when you did this thing?” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font2">Abraham said: “It was because I said to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font2">And besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font2">So when God caused me to wander from the house of my father, I said to her: ‘Let this be how you show loyal love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font2">A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">-edech then took sheep and cattle and male and female servants and gave them to Abraham, and he returned his wife Sarah to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">edech also said: “Here my land is available to you. Dwell wherever you please.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">And to Sarah he said: “Here I give 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother. It is a sign of your innocence to all who are with you and before everybody, and you are cleared of reproach.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">And Abraham began to make supplication to the true God, and God healed A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">eJech and his wife and his slave girls, and they began having children; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font2">for Jehovah had made all the women of the house of A^bim</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">eJech barren because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</span></p>

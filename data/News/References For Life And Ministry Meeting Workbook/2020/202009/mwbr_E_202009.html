<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have the Facts?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font6"> Are you the kind of person who enjoys sending e-mails and text messages to your friends and acquaintances? If so, when you see a newly published story in the news media or hear an experience, you might feel like a news reporter who wants to be the first to break an exciting story. However, before you send that text message or e-mail, ask yourself: ‘Am I certain that the information I am about to spread is true? Do I really have the facts?’ If you are not certain, you could unwittingly circulate false information among our brotherhood. If in doubt, hit the delete key, not the send button.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font6"> There is another danger in quickly forwarding e-mails and text messages. In some lands, our work is under restriction or outright ban. Our opposers in such lands may purposely circulate reports designed to instill fear or to cause us to distrust one another. Consider what happened in the former Soviet Union. The secret police, known as the KGB, spread rumors that various prominent brothers had betrayed Jehovah’s people. Many put confidence in such false reports, and as a result, they separated themselves from Jehovah’s organization. How sad! Thankfully, many later returned, but some never did. Their faith was shipwrecked. (1 Tim. 1:19) How can we avoid such a disastrous outcome? Refuse to circulate negative or unsubstantiated reports. Do not be naive, or gullible. Be sure you have the facts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 23:2) </span><span class="font1">You must not follow after the crowd to do evil, and you must not pervert justice by giving testimony to go along with the crowd.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Aaron</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is noteworthy that in each of his three deflections, Aaron does not appear as the principal initiator of the wrong action but, rather, seems to have allowed the pressure of the circumstances or the influence of others to sway him from a course of rectitude. Particularly in his first trespass, he could have applied the principle underlying the command: “You must not follow after the crowd for evil ends.” (Ex 23:2) Nevertheless, his name is thereafter used in the Scriptures in an honorable way, and God’s Son, during his earthly lifetime, recognized the legitimacy of the Aaronic priesthood.—Ps 115:10, 12; 118:3; 133:1, 2; 135:19; Mt 5:17-19; 8:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 23:3) </span><span class="font1">You must show impartiality in the dispute of a poor person.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Blindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Miscarriage of justice through judicial corruption was symbolized by blindness, and many are the exhortations in the Law against bribery, gifts, or prejudice, as such things can blind a judge and prevent the impartial administration of justice. “The bribe blinds clear-sighted men.” (Ex 23:8) “The bribe blinds the eyes of wise ones.” (De 16:19) A judge, no matter how upright and discerning, may be consciously or even unconsciously affected by a gift from those involved in the case. God’s law thoughtfully considers the blinding effect not only of a gift but also of sentiment, as it states: “You must not treat the lowly with partiality, and you must not prefer the person of a great one.” (Le 19:15) So, for sentimentality or for popularity with the crowd, a judge was not to render his verdict against the rich merely because they were rich. —Ex 23:2, 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do Not Forget Kindness to Strangers”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> Rather than order the Israelites to respect foreigners, Jehovah appealed to their empathy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Exodus 23:9.) </span><span class="font6">They knew ‘how it felt to be a foreigner.’ Even before they were reduced to slavery, the Hebrews were likely shunned by the Egyptians because of racial pride or religious prejudice. (Gen. 43:32; 46:34; Ex. 1:11-14) The Israelites had experienced a bitter life as foreign residents, but Jehovah expected them to treat the foreigner “like a native” among them.—Lev. 19:33, 34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 23:20, 21) </span><span class="font1">“I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place that I have prepared. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font1">Pay attention to him, and obey his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, because my name is in him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Michael</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span class="font6">The only holy angel other than Gabriel named in the Bible, and the only one called “archangel.” (Jude 9) The first occurrence of the name is in the tenth chapter of Daniel, where Michael is described as “one of the foremost princes”; he came to the aid of a lesser angel who was opposed by “the prince of the royal realm of Persia.” Michael was called “the prince of [Daniel’s] people,” “the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of [Daniel’s] people.” (Da 10:13, 20, 21; 12:1) This points to Michael as the angel who led the Israelites through the wilderness. (Ex 23:20, 21, 23; 32:34; 33:2) Lending support to this conclusion is the fact that “Michael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body.” —Jude 9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 25:9) </span><span class="font1">You are to make it, the tabernacle and all its furnishings, following exactly the pattern that I am showing you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 165</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ark of the Covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pattern and Design. </span><span class="font6">The first thing Jehovah gave Moses, when instructing him to build the tabernacle, was the pattern and design of the Ark, for indeed it was the central and paramount object of the tabernacle and the whole camp of Israel. The chest itself measured 2.5 cubits long, 1.5 cubits wide, and 1.5 cubits high (c. 111 x 67 x 67 cm; 44 x 26 x 26 in.). It was made of acacia wood, overlaid inside and out with pure gold. An artistic “border of gold” served as a crowning wreath “round about upon it.” The second section of the Ark, its cover, was made of solid gold, not just wood overlaid with gold, and was the full length and breadth of the chest. Mounted on this cover were two golden cherubs of hammered workmanship, one at each end of the cover facing each other, with heads bowed and wings extending upward and overspreading the Ark. (Ex 25:10, 11, 17-22; 37: 6-9) This cover was also known as the “mercy seat” or “propitiatory cover.”—Ex 25:17; Heb 9:5, ftn; see PROPITIATORY COVER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 25:21) </span><span class="font1">You will put the cover on the Ark, and in the Ark you will place the Testimony that I will give you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 166 fl2</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ark of the Covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Ark served as a holy archive for the safekeeping of sacred reminders or testimony, the principal contents being the two tablets of the testimony, or the Ten Commandments. (Ex 25: 16) A “golden jar having the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded” were added to the Ark but were later removed sometime before the building of Solomon’s temple. (Heb 9:4; Ex 16:32-34; Nu 17:10; 1Ki 8:9; 2Ch 5:10) Just before Moses died, he gave a copy of the “book of the law” to the Levitical priests with instructions that it should be kept, not within, but “at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, . . . as a witness there against you.” —De 31:24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 25:22) </span><span class="font1">I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover. From between the two cherubs that are on the ark of the Testimony, I will make known to you all that I will command you for the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 166 fl3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ark of the Covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Associated with God’s presence.</span><span class="font6"> The Ark was associated with God’s presence throughout its history. Jehovah promised: “I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover, from between the two cherubs that are upon the ark of the testimony.” “In a cloud I shall appear over the cover.” (Ex 25:22; Le 16:2) Samuel wrote that Jehovah “is sitting upon the cherubs” (1Sa 4:4); hence the cherubs served as “the representation of the chariot” of Jehovah. (1Ch 28:18) Accordingly, “whenever Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with [Jehovah], then he would hear the voice conversing with him from above the cover that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubs; and he would speak to him.” (Nu 7:89) Later, Joshua and High Priest Phinehas also inquired of Jehovah before the Ark. (Jos 7:6-10; Jg 20:27, 28) However, only the high priest actually entered the Most Holy and saw the Ark, one day a year, not to communicate with Jehovah, but in carrying out the Atonement Day ceremony.—Le 16:2, 3, 13, 15, 17; Heb 9:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 25:20) </span><span class="font1">The cherubs are to spread out their two wings upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings, and they will face each other. The faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 432 fl 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cherub</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Representative figures of cherubs were included in the furnishings of the tabernacle set up in the wilderness. Rising above each end of the Ark’s cover were two cherubs of hammered gold. They were facing each other and bowing toward the cover in an attitude of worship. Each had two wings that spread upward and screened over the cover in a guarding and protecting manner. (Ex 25:10-21; 37:7-9) Also, the inner covering of tent cloths for the tabernacle and the curtain dividing the Holy from the Most Holy had embroidered cherub figures.—Ex 26:1, 31; 36:8, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 25:30) </span><span class="font1">And you will put the showbread on the table before me constantly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Showbread</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Twelve cakes of bread that were placed on a table in the Holy compartment of the tabernacle or temple and that were replaced with fresh ones each Sabbath. (Ex 35:13; 39:36; 1Ki 7:48; 2Ch 13:11; Ne 10:32, 33) The literal Hebrew designation for the showbread is the “bread of the face.” The word for “face” sometimes denotes “presence” (2Ki 13:23), and so the showbread was in front of Jehovah’s face as an offering before him constantly. (Ex 25:30, ftn) The showbread is also referred to as “layer bread” (2Ch 2:4), “loaves of presentation” (Mr 2:26), and simply “the loaves” (Heb 9:2).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Urim and Thummim</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of Bible commentators believe that the Urim and the Thummim were lots. They are called “the sacred lots” in James Moffatt’s translation of Exodus 28:30. Some suppose that they consisted of three pieces, one inscribed with the word “yes,” one with “no,” and the other blank. These would be drawn, giving the answer to the question propounded, unless the blank piece was drawn, in which case no answer was forthcoming. Others think that they may have been two flat stones, white on one side and black on the other. When thrown down, two white sides up would mean “yes,” two black sides “no,” and a black and a white would mean no answer. On one occasion, when Saul had inquired through the priest as to whether to resume an attack on the Philistines, he received no answer. Feeling that someone among his men had sinned, he petitioned: “O God of Israel, do give Thummim!” Saul and Jonathan were taken from among those present; after that, lots were cast to decide between the two. In this account the appeal, “Do give Thummim,” seems to be separate from the lot casting, though it may give indication that there was some connection between the two.—1Sa 14:36-42.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Israel’s High Priest. </span><span class="font6">In Israel the high priest’s turban had on its front, over the priest’s forehead, a gold plate, “the holy sign of dedication,” upon which were inscribed “with the engravings of a seal” the words “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.” (Ex 28:36-38; 39:30) As Israel’s chief representative of Jehovah’s worship, it was fitting that the high priest keep his office holy, and this inscription would also serve as a reminder to all Israel of the need of constant holiness in the service of Jehovah. It also served as a suitable picture of the great High Priest, Jesus Christ, and his being dedicated by Jehovah to this priestly service that upholds God’s holiness. —Heb 7:26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Honor Jehovah by Displaying Dignity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font6">Special attention should be given to displaying dignity when we approach Jehovah in worship. “Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the true God,” says Ecclesiastes 5:1. Both Moses and Joshua were commanded to remove their sandals when in a holy place. (Ex. 3:5; Josh. 5:15) They were to do this as a gesture of respect or reverence. Israelite priests were obliged to wear linen drawers “to cover the naked flesh.” (Ex. 28:42, 43) This prevented indecent exposure when they served at the altar. Every member of a priest’s family was to uphold the godly standard of dignity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Where did the precious stones on the breastpiece of Israel’s high priest come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Israelites left Egypt and entered the wilderness, God gave them orders to make this breastpiece. (Exodus 28:15-21) The breastpiece had stones of ruby, topaz, emerald, turquoise, sapphire, jasper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">leshem,</span><span class="font6"> agate, amethyst, chrysolite, onyx, and jade. Did the Israelites really have access to those types of gems?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Bible times, people prized precious stones and traded them. The ancient Egyptians, for example, obtained gemstones from as far away as what is now modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, and possibly even India. Egyptian mines produced a number of different precious stones. The Egyptian monarchs had a monopoly on mineral extraction in the territories they controlled. The patriarch Job described how his contemporaries used shafts and underground galleries to search for treasures. Among other items dug from the ground, sapphire and topaz are specifically mentioned by Job.—Job 28:1-11, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Exodus account states that the Israelites “stripped the Egyptians” of their valuables when leaving the land. (Exodus 12:35, 36) So it is possible that the Israelites obtained from Egypt the stones used on the high priest’s breastpiece.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Holiness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Animals and Produce. </span><span class="font6">The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed. They were to be sacrificed, and a portion went to the sanctified priests. (Nu 18:17-19) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (Ex 28:38) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.—Le 5: 14-16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 30:11, 12) </span><span class="font1">Then Jehovah said to Moses: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">“Whenever you take a census and count the sons of Israel, each one must give a ransom for his life to Jehovah at the time of the census. This is so that no plague may be brought upon them when they are registered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-2 764-765 Registration</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At Sinai. </span><span class="font6">At Jehovah’s command the first registration took place during the encampment at Sinai in the second month of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. To assist Moses in this undertaking, a chieftain was selected out of each tribe to take the responsibility and oversight of the registration in his tribe. Not only were all males listed who were 20 years old and upward—eligible for service in the army—but the Law also placed on the registered ones a head tax of half a shekel ($1.10) for the service of the tabernacle. (Ex 30:11-16; Nu 1:116, 18, 19) The total number listed amounted to 603,550, excluding the Levites, who would have no inheritance in the land. These paid no tabernacle tax and were not required to serve in the army.—Nu 1:44-47; 2:32, 33; 18:20, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 30:13-15) </span><span class="font1">This is what all those who are registered will give: a half shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place. Twenty ge</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">rahs equal a shekel. A half shekel is the contribution to Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">Everyone registered who is 20 years old and up will give Jehovah’s contribution. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">The rich should not give more and the poor should not give less than the half shekel as a contribution to Jehovah to make atonement for your lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Contribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some contributions were required under the Law. When Moses took a census of the Israelites, each male 20 years old and upward was to give a ransom for his soul, “a half shekel [probably $1.10] by the shekel of the holy place.” It was “Jehovah’s contribution” in order to make atonement for their souls and “in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting.” (Ex 30:11-16) According to the Jewish historian Josephus (</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Jewish War,</span><span class="font6"> VII, 218 [vi, 6]), this “sacred tax” was thereafter paid annually.—2Ch 24:6-10; Mt 17:24; see TAXATION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 30:16) </span><span class="font1">You are to take the silver money of the atonement from the Israelites and give it in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting, that it may serve as a remembrance before Jehovah for the Israelites, to make atonement for your lives.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How were the services at Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem financed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The various temple services were maintained through taxation, mainly obligatory tithing. But other forms of taxation were also used. For example, at the time of the construction of the tabernacle, Jehovah instructed Moses to collect half a silver shekel from every registered Israelite, as a “contribution to Jehovah.”—Exodus 30:12-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Apparently, it became customary for each Jew to contribute this fixed amount as an annual temple tax. It was this tax that Jesus instructed Peter to pay with a coin taken from a fish’s mouth.—Matthew 17:24-27.</span></p>

The general meaning of the act, however, was that of a designation, a pointing out of the person or thing as being acknowledged, or recognized, in a certain way. During the ceremony at the installation of the priesthood, Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull and the two rams to be sacrificed, thereby acknowledging that these animals were being sacrificed for them for the sake of their becoming priests of Jehovah God. (Ex 29:10, 15, 19; Le 8:14, 18, 22) When appointing Joshua as his successor at God’s command, Moses laid his hand on Joshua, who consequently was “full of the spirit of wisdom” and so was able to lead Israel properly. (De 34:9) Hands were laid on persons when designating them as receivers of a blessing. (Ge 48:14; Mr 10:16) Jesus Christ touched, or laid his hands on, some persons he healed. (Mt 8:3; Mr 6:5; Lu 13:13) The gift of the holy spirit was granted in some instances through the laying on of the hands of the apostles.—Ac 8:14-20; 19:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 30:31-33) </span><span class="font1">“You will speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘This is to continue as a holy anointing oil to me during your generations. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>32</sup> </span><span class="font1">It is not to be applied to the flesh of mankind, and you must not make anything with a composition like it.

<p><span class="font6">In the Law Jehovah gave to Moses, he prescri bed a formula for the anointing oil. It was of a special composition of the choicest ingredients—myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil. (Ex 30:22-25) It was a capital offense for anyone to compound this mixture and to use it for any common or unauthorized purpose. (Ex 30:31-33) This figuratively demonstrated the importance and sacredness of an appointment to office that had been confirmed by anointing with sacred oil.</span></p>

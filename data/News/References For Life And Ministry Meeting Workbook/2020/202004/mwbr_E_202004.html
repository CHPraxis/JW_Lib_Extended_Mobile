<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Jacob and Laban Make a Covenant of Peace”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:44-46) </span><span class="font2">Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and it will serve as a witness between us.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>45</sup> </span><span class="font2">So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>46</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!” And they took stones and made a pile. After that they ate there on the pile of stones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Galeed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Peaceably settling the points over which they had disputed, Jacob and Laban concluded a covenant with each other. In this connection, Jacob set up a stone pillar and directed his “brothers” to make a heap of stones, perhaps in the form of a table, upon which the covenant meal was eaten. Thereupon, Laban called the place after this heap, giving it the Aramaic (Syrian) name “Jegar-sahadutha,” but which Jacob called “Galeed,” the Hebrew equivalent. Laban said: “This heap [Heb., </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gal</span><span class="font1">] is a witness [Heb., </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’edh</span><span class="font1">] between me and you today.” (Ge 31:44-48) The heap of stones (and the stone pillar) served as a witness to all passersby. It was as verse 49 says, “The Watchtower [Heb., </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mitspah</span><span class="font1">],” testifying that Jacob and Laban had agreed to preserve the peace between and within their respective families. (Ge 31:5053) On later occasions stones were used in a similar fashion as silent witnesses.—Jos 4:4-7; 24:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:47-50) </span><span class="font2">And La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban began calling it Je</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">gar-sa^ha^du</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">tha, but Jacob called it Gal</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">e^ed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>48</sup> </span><span class="font2">La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban then said: “This pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.” That is why he named it Gal</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">e^ed,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>49</sup> </span><span class="font2">and the Watchtower, for he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me when we are out of each other’s sight. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>50</sup> </span><span class="font2">If you mistreat my daughters and if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters, though there is no man with us, remember that God will be a witness between you and me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A pile of stones was set up by Jacob and called “Galeed” (meaning “Witness Heap”) and “The Watchtower.” Laban then said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen the one from the other.” (Ge 31:45-49) This pile of stones would testify to the fact that Jehovah was watching to see that Jacob and Laban carried out their covenant of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:51-53) </span><span class="font2">La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this pile of stones, and here is the pillar that I have erected between you and me. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>52</sup> </span><span class="font2">This pile of stones is a witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>53</sup> </span><span class="font2">Let the God of Abraham and the God of Na</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">hor, the God of their father, judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the One whom his father Isaac fears.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:19) </span><span class="font2">Now La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the tera-phim statues that belonged to her father.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Teraphim</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The findings of archaeologists in Mesopotamia and adjacent areas indicate that the possession of the teraphim images had a bearing on who would receive the family inheritance. According to one tablet found at Nuzi, the possession of the household gods could under certain circumstances entitle a son-in-law to appear in court and claim the estate of his deceased fatherin-law. (</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</span><span class="font1"> edited by J. Pritchard, 1974, pp. 219, 220, and ftn 51) Perhaps Rachel, with this in mind, reasoned that she was justified in taking the teraphim because of her father’s deceptive dealings with her husband Jacob. (Compare Ge 31:14-16.) The importance of the teraphim with respect to inheritance rights would also explain why Laban was so anxious to recover them, even to the point of taking his brothers with him and pursuing Jacob for a distance of seven days’ journey. (Ge 31:19-30) Of course, what Rachel had done was completely unknown to Jacob (Ge 31:32), and there is no indication that he ever attempted to use the teraphim to gain the inheritance from Laban’s sons. Jacob had nothing to do with idols. At the latest, the teraphim would have been disposed of when Jacob hid all the foreign gods turned over to him by his household under the big tree that was close to Shechem.—Ge 35:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:41, 42) </span><span class="font2">This makes 20 years for me in your house. I have served you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>42</sup> </span><span class="font2">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the One whom Isaac fears, had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and that is why he reproved you last night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Peter 2:18) </span><span class="font2">Let servants be in subjection to their masters with all due fear, not only to the good and reasonable but also to those hard to please.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah—Our Place of Dwelling</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font1"> When Jacob reached Haran, his uncle Laban extended a warm welcome to him and later gave him Leah and Rachel as wives. In time, though, Laban tried to exploit Jacob, changing his wages ten times! (Gen. 31:41, 42) Yet, Jacob endured these injustices, confident that Jehovah would continue to care for him—and He did! Indeed, by the time God told Jacob to return to Canaan, the patriarch possessed “great flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses.” (Gen. 30:43) Deeply appreciative, Jacob prayed: “I am unworthy of all the loving-kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have exercised toward your servant, for with but my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps.”—Gen. 32:10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Bible Reading</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 31:1-18) </span><span class="font2">In time he heard what the sons of La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban were saying: “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father, and from what belonged to our father, he has amassed all this wealth.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font2">When Jacob would look at the face of La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban, he saw that his attitude toward him was not what it used to be. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font2">Finally Jehovah said to Jacob: “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will continue with you.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Le</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ah to come out to the field to his flock, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font2">and he said to them: “I have seen that your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font2">You yourselves certainly know that I have served your father with all my power. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font2">And your father has tried to cheat me and has changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font2">If on the one hand he would say, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced speckled ones; but if on the other hand he would say, ‘The striped ones will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped ones. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font2">So God kept taking your father’s livestock away from him and giving it to me. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font2">Once when the flock got into heat, I raised my eyes and saw in a dream that the he-goats mating with the flock were striped, speckled, and spotty. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then the angel of the true God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ to which I said, ‘Here I am.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font2">And he continued, ‘Raise your eyes, please, and see that all the he-goats mating with the flock are striped, speckled, and spotty, for I have seen all that La</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ban is doing to you. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font2">I am the true God of Beth</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">el, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now get up, go out of this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font2">At this Rachel and Le</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">-ah answered him: “Is there any share left for us to inherit in our father’s house? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">Does he not consider us as foreigners, since he has sold us and has been using up the money given for us? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">All the riches that God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. So, then, do everything that God has told you to do.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then Jacob got up and lifted his children and his wives on the camels, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font2">and he began driving all his herd and all the goods that he had accumulated, the livestock in his possession that he had accumulated in Pad</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">dan-a</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Ca</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">naan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 32:24) </span><span class="font2">Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w03 8/15 25</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are You Earnestly Seeking Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Scriptures abound with examples of those who put forth concerted efforts in seeking Jehovah. One such person was Jacob, who strenuously grappled with God’s materialized angel till dawn. As a result, Jacob was given the name Israel (Contender with God) because he “contended,” or “persisted,” “exerted [himself],” “persevered,” with God. The angel blessed him for his earnest endeavor.—Genesis 32:2430, footnote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 32:25, 26) </span><span class="font2">When he saw that he had not prevailed over him, he touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font2">After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you bless me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it-2 190</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lame, Lameness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jacob’s Lameness.</span><span class="font1"> When Jacob was about 97 years old, he had the experience of grappling all night with a materialized angel of God. He prevailed in detaining the angel until the angel gave him a blessing. During the contest, the angel touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint, throwing it out of place. The result was that Jacob walked with a limp. (Ge 32:24-32; Ho 12:2-4) Jacob thereafter had a reminder that, although he had “contended with God [God’s angel] and with men so that [he] at last prevailed,” as the angel said, he did not in reality defeat a powerful angel of God. It was only by God’s purpose and permission that Jacob was allowed to contend with the angel, so as to provide proof of Jacob’s great appreciation of the need of God’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 32:27, 28) </span><span class="font2">So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font2">Then he said: “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel, for you have contended with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God and with men and you have at last prevailed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span class="font1">The name God gave to Jacob when he was about 97 years old. It was during the night that Jacob crossed the torrent valley of Jabbok on his way to meet his brother Esau that he began struggling with what turned out to be an angel. Because of Jacob’s perseverance in the struggle, his name was changed to Israel as a token of God’s blessing. In commemoration of these events, Jacob named the place Peniel or Pen-uel. (Ge 32:22-31; see JACOB No. 1.) Later, at Bethel the change in name was confirmed by God, and from then on to the end of his life Jacob was frequently called Israel. (Ge 35:10, 15; 50:2; 1Ch 1:34) Many of the more than 2,500 occurrences of the name Israel, however, are in reference to Jacob’s descendants as a nation. —Ex 5:1, 2.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font1"> Gracious speech and good communication help to establish and sustain peaceful relationships. In fact, doing what we can to improve our relationships with others can improve our communication with them. Reaching out to others with sincere, kind acts—finding opportunities to help, giving a gift from the heart, extending hospitality—can contribute to open communication. It can even “heap fiery coals” on a person and may bring out good qualities, making it easier to talk things out.—Rom. 12:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup></span><span class="font1"> The patriarch Jacob understood this. His twin brother, Esau, was so angry with him that Jacob fled for fear Esau would kill him. After many years, Jacob returned. Esau came out to meet him, along with 400 men. Jacob prayed for Jehovah’s help. Then he sent ahead to Esau a large gift of livestock. The gift achieved its purpose. When they met, Esau’s heart had softened, and he ran and embraced Jacob. —Gen. 27:41-44; 32:6, 11, 13-15; 33:4, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 33:20) </span><span class="font2">There he set up an altar and called it God, the God of Israel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God the God of Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a result of his encounter at Peniel with the angel of Jehovah, Jacob was given the name Israel, and after a peaceable meeting with his brother Esau, he dwelt at Succoth and then Shechem. Here he acquired a tract of land from the sons of Hamor and pitched his tent upon it. (Ge 32:24-30; 33:1-4, 17-19) “After that he set up there an altar and called it God the God of Israel,” or “God Is the God of Israel.” (Ge 33:20) In identifying himself by his newly given name Israel with the name of the altar, Jacob indicated his acceptance and appreciation of that name and of God’s guiding him safely back into the Promised Land. The expression occurs only once in the Scriptures.</span></p>

Then he took some of his possessions as a gift for E</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">sau his brother: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font2">200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 rams, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font2">30 camels nursing their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 full-grown male donkeys. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font2">He handed them over to his servants, one drove after another, and he said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and you are to set a space between one drove and the next.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font2">He also commanded the first one: “In case E</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">sau my brother should meet you and ask, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font2">then you should say, ‘To your servant Jacob.

<p><span class="font1">How would the young men of the city view this young virgin who regularly visited their city—ap-parently unaccompanied? A chieftain’s son “got to see her and then took her and lay down with her and violated her.” Why did Dinah court danger by associating with the immoral Canaanites? Was it because she felt she needed the company of girls her own age? Was she as headstrong and independent as some of her brothers? Read the Genesis account, and try to comprehend the distress and shame that Jacob and Leah must have felt because of the tragic consequences of their daughter’s visits to She-chem.—Genesis 34:1-31; 49:5-7; see also </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> June 15, 1985, page 31.</span></p>

Because he was attracted to Dinah, he “took her” and “violated her.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Genesis 34:1-4.) </span><span class="font1">This crime started a series of events that resulted in tragedy for Dinah and her whole family.—Genesis 34:7, 25-31; Galatians 6:7, 8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Oftentimes, those seeking retaliation do so in an effort to ease the emotional pain of an offense. For example, the Bible tells us that when the sons of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob learned that the Canaanite Shechem had violated their sister Dinah, they “became hurt in their feelings and they grew very angry.” (Genesis 34:1-7) To avenge the wrong done to their sister, two of Jacob’s sons plotted against Shechem and his household. Using a ruse, Simeon and Levi entered the Canaanite city and killed every male, including Shechem.—Genesis 34:13-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Did all that bloodshed settle the matter? When Jacob learned of his sons’ actions, he rebuked them, saying: “You have brought ostracism upon me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, . . . and they will certainly gather together against me and assault me and I must be annihilated, I and my house.” (Genesis 34:30) Yes, instead of settling matters, their vengeful actions had the opposite effect; Jacob’s family now had to be wary of counterattacks by angry neighbors. Likely to prevent such an outcome, God instructed Jacob to move his family out of the area to Bethel.—Genesis 35: 1, 5.</span></p>

When Rebekah left the household of her father Bethuel to move to Palestine and marry Isaac, Deborah accompanied her. (Ge 24:59) After years of service in Isaac’s household, Deborah came to be in Jacob’s household, perhaps after the death of Rebekah. Evidently some 125 years after Rebekah’s marriage to Isaac, Deborah died and was buried under a big tree at Bethel. The name given to the tree (Allon-bacuth, meaning “Massive Tree of Weeping”) indicates how beloved she had become to Jacob and his family.—Ge 35:8. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 35:22-26) </span><span class="font2">Once while Israel was dwelling in that land, Reu</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">ben went and lay down with Bil</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font2">hah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In ancient Israel, was the line leading to the Messiah tied to the right of the firstborn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have at times made comments to that effect. That seemed to agree with what we read at Hebrews 12:16. That verse says that Esau did </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“not appreciate sacred things”</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“gave up </span><span class="font1">[</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to Jacob the</span><span class="font1">] </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rights as firstborn</span><span class="font1"> in exchange for one meal.” This appeared to suggest that when Jacob gained the “rights as firstborn,” he also came in line to be an ancestor to the Mes-siah.—Matt. 1:2, 16; Luke 3:23, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, a review of Bible accounts shows that a man did not need to be a firstborn son to be an ancestor of the Messiah. Consider some of the evidence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the sons of Jacob (Israel), his firstborn by Leah was Reuben. Later, Jacob’s first son by his favored wife, Rachel, was Joseph. When Reuben became guilty of misconduct, the right of firstborn passed to Joseph. (Gen. 29:31-35; 30:2225; 35:22-26; 49:22-26; 1 Chron. 5:1, 2) Still, the Messianic line came down through neither Reuben nor Joseph. It was through Judah, Jacob’s fourth son by Leah.—Gen. 49:10.</span></p>

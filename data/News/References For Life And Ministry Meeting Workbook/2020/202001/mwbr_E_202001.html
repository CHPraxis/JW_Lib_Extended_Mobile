<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:3, 4) </span><span class="font1">And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:6) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:9) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:11) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>it</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 527-528</span><br><br><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Creation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">When God said on Day One, “Let light come to be,” diffused light evidently penetrated the cloud layers even though the sources of that light could not yet be discerned from the earth’s surface. It seems that this was a gradual process, as is indicated by translator J. W. Watts: “And gradually light came into existence.” (Ge 1:3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Distinctive Translation of Genesis</span><span class="font7">) God brought about a division between the light and the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night. This indicates that the earth was rotating on its axis as it revolved around the sun, so that its hemispheres, eastern and western, could enjoy periods of light and darkness. —Ge 1:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Day Two God made an expanse by causing a division to occur “between the waters and the waters.” Some waters remained on the earth, but a great amount of water was raised high above the surface of the earth, and in between these two there came to be an expanse. God called the expanse Heaven, but this was with relation to the earth, as the waters suspended above the expanse are not said to have enclosed stars or other bodies of the outer heavens.—Ge 1:6-8; see EXPANSE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Day Three by God’s miracle-working power the waters on the earth were brought together and dry land appeared, God calling it Earth. It was also on this day that, through no chance factors or evolutionary processes, God acted to superimpose the life principle upon atoms of matter, so that grass, vegetation, and fruit trees were brought into existence. Each of these three general divisions was capable of reproducing according to its “kind.”—Ge 1:9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:14) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:20) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:24) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:27) </span><span class="font1">And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>it</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 528 fl5-8</span><br><br><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Creation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It is also noteworthy that at Genesis 1:16 the Hebrew verb </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ba-ra'',</span><span class="font7"> meaning “create,” is not used. Instead, the Hebrew verb </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'a-sah',</span><span class="font7"> meaning “make,” is employed. Since the sun, moon, and stars are included in “the heavens” mentioned in Genesis 1:1, they were created long before Day Four. On the fourth day God proceeded to “make” these celestial bodies occupy a new relationship toward earth’s surface and the expanse above it. When it is said, “God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth,” this would indicate that they now became discernible from the surface of the earth, as though they were in the expanse. Also, the luminaries were to “serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years,” thus later providing guidance for man in various ways.—Ge 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Day Five was marked by the creation of the first nonhuman souls on earth. Not just </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font7"> creature purposed by God to evolve into other forms, but literally </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">swarms</span><span class="font7"> of living souls were then brought forth by divine power. It is stated: “God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind.” Pleased with what He had produced, God blessed them and, in effect, told them to “become many,” which was possible, for these creatures of many different family kinds were divinely endowed with the ability to reproduce “according to their kinds.”—Ge 1:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Day Six “God proceeded to make the wild beast of the earth according to its kind and the domestic animal according to its kind and every moving animal of the ground according to its kind,” such work being good, as were all of God’s previous creative works.—Ge 1:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Toward the end of the sixth day of creative activity, God brought into existence an entirely new kind of creature, superior to the animals even though lower than the angels. This was man, created in God’s image and after his likeness. While Genesis 1:27 briefly states concerning humankind “male and female he [God] created them,” the parallel account at Genesis 2:7-9 shows that Jehovah God formed man out of the dust of the ground, blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul, for whom a paradise home and food were provided. In this case Jehovah used the elements of the earth in creative work and then, having formed man, He created the female of humankind using one of Adam’s ribs as a base. (Ge 2:18-25) With the creation of the woman, man was complete as a “kind.”—Ge 5: 1, 2.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Age of the earth and the universe</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Scientists estimate that the earth is about 4 billion years old and that the universe was born some 13 to 14 billion years ago. The Bible sets no date for the creation of the universe. In no place does it affirm that the earth is only a few thousand years old. The very first verse in the Bible reads: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) That general statement allows scientists to determine the age of the physical world according to sound scientific principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:26) </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not a co-Creator.</span><span class="font7"> The Son’s share in the creative works, h oweve r, did not make him a co-Creator with his Father. The power for creation came from God through his holy spirit, or active force. (Ge 1:2; Ps 33:6) And since Jehovah is the Source of all life, all animate creation, visible and invisible, owes its life to him. (Ps 36:9) Rather than a co-Creator, then, the Son was the agent or instrumentality through whom Jehovah, the Creator, worked. Jesus himself credited God with the creation, as do all the Scriptures.—Mt 19:4-6; see CREATION.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 1:1-19) </span><span class="font1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">Now the earth was formless and desolate, and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep, and God’s active force was moving about over the surface of the waters. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night.

And it was so. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 3:1-5) </span><span class="font1">Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">At this the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’ ” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">At this the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W17.02</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5 fl 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Purpose Will Be Fulfilled!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font7">Satan the Devil, using a serpent, fooled Eve into disobeying her Father, Jehovah. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Genesis 3:1-5; </span><span class="font7">Rev. 12:9) Satan made an issue of the fact that God’s human children were not allowed to eat “from every tree of the garden.” It was as if he were saying: ‘You mean you cannot do what you want?’ Next, he told a blatant lie: “You certainly will not die.” Then he tried to convince Eve that she need not listen to God, saying: “God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened.” Satan implied that Jehovah did not want them to eat the fruit because doing so would enlighten them. Further, Satan made this false promise: “You will be like God, knowing good and bad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 3:6) </span><span class="font1">Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>w00</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11/15 25-26</span><br><br><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>We Can Learn From the First Human Couple</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Was Eve’s sin inevitable? By no means! Put yourself in her place. The serpent’s claim completely distorted what God and Adam had said. How would you feel if a stranger charged someone you love and trust with dishonesty? Eve should have reacted differently, showing disgust and indignation, even refusing to listen. After all, who was the serpent to question God’s righteousness and her husband’s word? Out of respect for the principle of headship, Eve should have sought advice before making any decision. So should we if we are ever presented with information contrary to God-given instructions. Yet, Eve trusted the Tempter’s words, desiring to be her own judge of what was good and what was bad. The more she toyed with the idea, the more it appealed to her. What an error she made by entertaining a wrong desire, instead of dismissing it from her mind or discussing matters with her family head!—1 Corinthians 11:3; James 1:14, 15.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Adam Listens to His Wife’s Voice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Eve soon induced Adam to join her in sin. How are we to explain his limp acquiescence? (Genesis 3:6, 17) Adam faced a conflict of loyalties. Would he obey his Creator, who had given him everything, including his beloved mate, Eve? Would Adam seek God’s direction on what he was to do now? Or would the man throw in his lot with his wife? Adam knew very well that what she hoped to gain by eating the forbidden fruit was illusory. The apostle Paul was inspired to write: “Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and came to be in transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:14) So Adam deliberately chose to defy Jehovah. His fear of being separated from his wife was evidently greater than his faith in God’s ability to remedy the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 3:15-19) </span><span class="font1">And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Does God Really Care About Women?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Have women been cursed by God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No. Instead, it is “the original serpent, the one called Devil,” who has been “cursed” by God. (Revelation 12:9; Genesis 3:14) When God said that Adam would “dominate” his wife, God was not indicating his approval of the subjugation of woman by man. (Genesis 3:16) He was simply foretelling the sad consequences of sin on the first couple.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Book of Genesis—I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3:17—In what way was the ground cursed, and for how long? </span><span class="font7">The curse pronounced on the ground meant that cultivating it would now become very difficult. The effects of the cursed ground, with its thorns and thistles, were so keenly felt by Adam’s descendants that Noah’s father, Lamech, spoke of “the pain of our hands resulting from the ground which Jehovah has cursed.” (Genesis 5:29) After the Flood, Jehovah blessed Noah and his sons, stating His purpose that they fill the earth. (Genesis 9:1) God’s curse on the ground was apparently lift-ed.—Genesis 13:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The tribulation associated with giving birth. God expressed to the first woman, Eve, after she had sinned, what the result would be as to childbearing. If she had remained obedient, God’s blessing would have continued upon her and childbearing would have been an unmixed joy, for, “the blessing of Jehovah—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” (Pr 10: 22) But now, as a general rule, the imperfect functioning of the body would bring pain. Accordingly, God said (as often the things that he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">permits</span><span class="font7"> are said to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">done</span><span class="font7"> by him): “I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in birth pangs you will bring forth children.”—Ge 3:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The poem that Lamech composed for his wives (Ge 4:23, 24) reflects the violent spirit of that day. Lamech’s poem ran: “Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, yes, a young man for giving me a blow. If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times and seven.” Evidently Lamech was presenting a case of self-defense, pleading that his act was not one of deliberate murder, like that of Cain. La-mech claimed that, in defending himself, he had killed the man who struck and wounded him. Therefore, his poem stood as a plea for immunity against anyone desiring to get revenge against him for killing his attacker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 4:26) </span><span class="font1">There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him E</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font1">nosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The “calling on the name of Jehovah” that started in the time of Enosh during the pre-Flood period must not have been of an upright and proper nature, for Abel long before that had undoubtedly been directing himself to God by the divine name. (Ge 4:26; Heb 11:4) If, as some scholars hold, this calling on God’s name was in the sense of misusing it and improperly applying Jehovah’s name to humans or to idolatrous objects, then this would constitute a blasphemous act.—See ENOSH, ENOS.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 6:9) </span><span class="font1">This is the history of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 6:13) </span><span class="font1">After that God said to Noah: “I have decided to put an end to all flesh, because the earth is full of violence on account of them, so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Challenges that Noah faced.</span><span class="font7"> By the time of Noah’s great-grandfather Enoch, people had become very ungodly. They were even saying “shocking things” against Jehovah. (Jude 14, 15) Violence was increasing. In fact, in Noah’s day, “the earth was filled with violence.” Wicked</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">angels materialized as humans, took wives, and produced brutal, hybrid offspring. (Gen. 6:2-4, 11, 12) But Noah stood out as different. “Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.... He</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God.”—Gen. 6: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 6:14-16) </span><span class="font1">Make for yourself an ark from resinous wood.

<p><span class="font7">The work took decades, perhaps 40 to 50 years. There were trees to fell, logs to haul, and beams to hew, shape, and join. The ark was to have three stories, or decks, a number of compartments, and a door in the side. Evidently, there were windows along the top, as well as a roof that likely peaked in the middle with a slight pitch so that water would run off.—Genesis 6: 14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 6:22) </span><span class="font1">And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so.</span></p>

Note what Paul wrote about Noah. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Read Hebrews 11:7.)</span><span class="font7"> “The deluge of waters upon the earth [that would] bring to ruin all flesh” was something that Noah had “not yet beheld.” (Gen. 6:17) It was something that had never taken place before, something totally unprecedented. Still, Noah did not dismiss it as impossible or even improbable. Why? Because he had faith that whatever Jehovah said, Jehovah would do. Noah did not feel that what he was asked to do was too difficult. Rather, “he did just so.” (Gen. 6:22) Considering all that Noah had to do—building the ark, gathering the animals, stocking the ark with food for humans and animals, preaching a warning message, and keeping his family spiritually strong—it was no small task to do “just so.” Yet, Noah’s faith and endurance resulted in life and blessings for him and for his family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7:2—What was used as a basis for making a distinction between clean and unclean animals?</span><span class="font7"> The basis of distinction evidently pertained to the use of sacrifices in worship and not to what could and could not be eaten. Animal flesh was not a part of man’s diet prior to the Flood. The designations “clean” and “unclean” for food came into existence only with the Mosaic Law, and they ended when it was abolished. (Acts 10:9-16; Ephesians 2:15) Apparently, Noah knew what was suitable for sacrifice in the worship of Jehovah. As soon as he left the ark, he “began to build an altar to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts and of all the clean flying creatures and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar.”—Gene-sis 8:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 7:11) </span><span class="font1">In the 600th year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the 17th day of the month, on that day all the springs of the vast watery deep burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.</span></p>

The waters “above” were huge quantities of moisture suspended high above the earth, forming a “vast watery deep.” These waters fell upon the earth in Noah’s day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Characteristics of Ancient Babylon. </span><span class="font7">The founding of the city of Babylon on the Plains of Shinar was concurrent with the attempt at building the Tower of Babel. (Ge 11:2-9) The popular cause to be advanced by the tower and city construction was, not the exaltation of God’s name, but that the builders might “make a celebrated name” for themselves. The ziggurat towers uncovered not only in the ruins of ancient Babylon but elsewhere in Mesopotamia would seem to confirm the essentially religious nature of the original tower, whatever its form or style. The decisive action taken by Jehovah God to overthrow the temple construction clearly condemns it as of a false religious origin. Whereas the Hebrew name given the city, Babel, means “Confusion,” the Sumerian name (</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ka-dingir-ra</span><span class="font7">) and the Akkadian name (</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bab-ilu</span><span class="font7">) both mean “Gate of God.” Thus the remaining inhabitants of the city altered the form of its name to avoid the original condemnatory sense, but the new or substitute form still identified the city with religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Genesis account describes the uniting of some part of the post-Flood human family in a project that opposed God’s will as stated to Noah and his sons. (Ge 9:1) Instead of spreading out and ‘filling the earth,’ they determined to centralize human society, concentrating their residence on a site in what became known as the Plains of Shinar in Mesopotamia. Evidently this was also to become a religious center, with a religious tower.—Ge 11:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 11:6-8) </span><span class="font1">Jehovah then said: “Look! They are one people with one language, and this is what they have started to do. Now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">Come! Let us go down there and confuse their language in order that they may not understand one another’s language.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">So Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Language</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Almighty God gave their presumptuous project a setback by breaking up their unity of action, accomplishing this by confusing their common language. This made impossible any coordi -nated work on their project and led to their scattering to all parts of the globe. The confusion of their language would also hinder or slow down future progress in a wrong direction, a God-defying direction, since it would limit mankind’s ability to combine its intellectual and physical powers in ambitious schemes and also make it difficult to draw upon the accumulated knowledge of the different language groups formed—knowledge, not from God, but gained through human experience and research. (Compare Ec 7:29; De 32:5.) So, while it introduced a major divisive factor into human society, the confusion of human speech actually benefited human society in retarding the attainment of dangerous and hurtful goals. (Ge 11:5-9; compare Isa 8:9, 10.) One has only to consider certain developments in our own times, resulting from accumulated secular knowledge and man’s misuse thereof, to realize what God foresaw long ago would develop if the effort at Babel were allowed to go unhindered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Genesis 11:9) </span><span class="font1">That is why it was named Ba</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font1">bel, because there Jehovah confused the language of all the earth, and Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is possible that Canaan himself had been involved directly in the incident and that his father Ham had failed to correct him. Or Noah, speaking prophetically by inspiration, foresaw that the bad tendency in Ham, perhaps already manifest in his son Canaan, would be inherited by Canaan’s offspring. The curse was partly fulfilled when the Semitic Israelites subjugated the Canaanites. Those who were not destroyed (for example, the Gibeonites [Jos 9]) were made slaves to Israel. Centuries later, the curse was further fulfilled when descendants of Ham’s son Canaan came under the domination of the Japhetic world powers of Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.</span></p>

(Ge 10:10) Therefore it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began. This conclusion is also in agreement with the traditional Jewish view. Wrote Josephus: “[Nimrod] little by little transformed the state of affairs into a tyranny, holding that the only way to detach men from the fear of God was by making them continuously dependent upon his own power. He threatened to have his revenge on God if He wished to inundate the earth again; for he would build a tower higher than the water could reach and avenge the destruction of their forefathers. The people were eager to follow this advice of [Nimrod], deeming it slavery to submit to God; so they set out to build the tower . . . and it rose with a speed beyond all expec-tation.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jewish Antiquities,</span><span class="font7"> I, 114, 115 (iv, 2, 3).</span></p>

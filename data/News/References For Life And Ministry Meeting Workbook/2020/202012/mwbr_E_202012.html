<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Love for Jehovah Stronger Than Love for Family”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 10:1, 2) </span><span class="font1">Later Aaron’s sons Na</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">-dab and A^bi</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">hu each took his fire holder and put fire in it and placed incense on it. Then they began offering before Jehovah unauthorized fire, which he had not commanded them to do. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">At this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died before Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Illegitimate</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Illegitimate Fire and Incense. </span><span class="font1">At Leviticus 10:1 the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">zar</span><span class="font1"> (feminine, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">za-rah';</span><span class="font1"> literally, strange) is used with regard to “illegitimate fire, which [God] had not prescribed for them” but which Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu presented before Jehovah and for which he executed them by fire. (Le 10:2; Nu 3:4; 26:61) Subsequently, Jehovah said to Aaron: “Do not drink wine or intoxicating liquor, you and your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, that you may not die. It is a statute to time indefinite for your generations, both in order to make a distinction between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean, and in order to teach the sons of Israel all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them by means of Moses.” (Le 10:8-11) This seems to indicate that Nadab and Abihu were in a state of intoxication, which condition emboldened them to offer fire not prescribed. Such fire was likely illegal as to its time, place, or manner of offering, or it could have been incense other than of the composition described at Exodus 30:34, 35. Their inebriated condition did not excuse their sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 10:4, 5) </span><span class="font1">So Moses called Mish</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">a-el and Ebza</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">phan, the sons of Uz</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">zrel, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them: “Come here, carry your brothers from in front of the holy place to a place outside the camp.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So they came forward and carried the men away in their robes to a place outside the camp, just as Moses had told them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 10:6, 7) </span><span class="font1">Moses then said to Aaron and his other sons Ebe^a</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">zar and Ith</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">a^mar: “Do not let your heads go ungroomed or tear your garments, so that you may not die and that God may not become indignant against all the assembly. Your brothers of the whole house of Israel will weep over those whom Jehovah has killed by the fire. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting or you will die, for Jehovah’s anointing oil is upon you.” So they did according to Moses’ word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Rest—Have You Entered Into It?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">Moses’ brother, Aaron, faced a difficult situation with regard to two of his sons. Think of how he must have felt when his sons Nadab and Abi-hu offered illegitimate fire to Jehovah and He struck them dead. Of course, that ended any association those men could have had with their parents. But there is more. Jehovah instructed Aaron and his faithful sons: “Do not let your heads go ungroomed, and you must not tear your garments [in mourning], that you may not die and that [Jehovah] may not become indignant against all the assembly.” (Lev. 10:1-6) The message is clear. Our love for Jehovah must be stronger than our love for unfaithful family members.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 10:8-11) </span><span class="font1">Then Jehovah said to Aaron: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">“Do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages, you and your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We Must Be Holy in All Our Conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">To be holy, we must weigh the Scriptures carefully and do what God asks of us. Consider Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu, who were executed for offering “unauthorized fire,” perhaps while inebriated. (Lev. 10:1, 2) Note what God then told Aaron. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">( Read Leviticus 10:811.) </span><span class="font1">Does that passage mean that we must not drink anything alcoholic before going to a Christian meeting? Think about these points: We are not under the Law. (Rom. 10:4) In some lands, our fellow believers use alcoholic beverages </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in moderation</span><span class="font1"> at meals before attending meetings. Four cups of wine were used at the Passover. When instituting the Memorial, Jesus had his apostles drink wine that represented his blood. (Matt. 26:27) The Bible condemns heavy drinking and drunkenness. (1 Cor. 6:10; 1 Tim. 3:8) And many Christians would feel impelled by their conscience to abstain completely from alcoholic beverages before engaging in any form of sacred service. However, circumstances vary from one country to another, and the important thing is for Christians to “distinguish between the holy thing and the profane” so as to conduct themselves with holiness that pleases God. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 11:8) </span><span class="font1">You must not eat any of their flesh or touch their dead body. They are unclean for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 111 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fl </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Animals</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These dietary limitations applied only to those who were under the Mosaic Law, for the statement of Leviticus 11:8 is: “They are unclean for you,” that is, for the Israelites. With the abrogation of the Law on the basis of the sacrificial death of Christ Jesus, the prohibitions were canceled, and once more all humans could consider themselves under the same broad provision announced to Noah following the Deluge. —Col 2:13-17; Ge 9:3, 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">•</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Isolating sick people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The Mosaic Law prescribed keeping people with leprosy separate from others. Not until the plagues of the Middle Ages did medical doctors learn to apply this principle, which is still deemed effective.—Leviticus, chapters 13 and 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 13:45, 46) </span><span class="font1">As for the leper who has the disease, his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and he should cover over his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>46</sup> </span><span class="font1">He will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease. Since he is unclean, he should live in isolation. His dwelling place will be outside the camp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ancient Jews had a fear of the form of leprosy common in Bible times. That dreaded disease could attack the sufferer’s nerve endings and lead to permanent damage and disfigurement. There was no known cure for leprosy. Rather, those afflicted by it were quarantined and were obliged to warn others of their condition.—Leviticus 13:45, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 13:52) </span><span class="font1">He should burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in which the disease has developed, for it is malignant leprosy. It should be burned in the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 13:57) </span><span class="font1">However, if it still appears in another part of the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is spreading, and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In garments and houses.</span><span class="font1"> Leprosy could also affect woolen or linen garments, or an article of skin. The plague might disappear with washing, and there were arrangements for quarantining the article. But where this yellowish-green or reddish plague persisted, malignant leprosy was present and the article was to be burned. (Le 13:47-59) If yellowish-green or reddish depressions appeared in the wall of a house, the priest imposed a quarantine. It might be necessary to tear out affected stones and have the house scraped off inside, the stones and scraped-off mortar being disposed of in an unclean place outside the city. If the plague returned, the house was declared unclean and was pulled down, and the materials were disposed of in an unclean place. But for the house pronounced clean there was an arrangement for purification. (Le 14:33-57) It has been suggested that the leprosy affecting garments or houses was a type of mildew or mold; however, about this there is uncertainty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Highlights From the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12:2, 5—Why did childbirth make a woman “unclean”?</span><span class="font1"> The reproductive organs were made to pass on perfect human life. However, because of the inherited effects of sin, imperfect and sinful life was passed on to the offspring. The temporary periods of ‘uncleanness’ associated with childbirth, as well as other matters, such as menstruation and seminal emissions, called this hereditary sinfulness to mind. (Leviticus 15:16-24; Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:12) The required purification regulations would help the Israelites to appreciate the need for a ransom sacrifice to cover mankind’s sinfulness and restore human perfection. Thus the Law became their “tutor leading to Christ.”—Ga-latians 3:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 12:3) </span><span class="font1">On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin will be circumcised.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">God’s Law stipulated that a male child should be circumcised on the eighth day of life. (Leviticus 12:3) In newborn babies, the blood’s ability to clot is understood to reach normal levels after the first week. In Bible times, before advanced medical treatments were available, waiting for over a week before circumcision was a wise protection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bathing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ceremonial bathing on the part of the Israelites in general was required for various reasons. Anyone who recovered from leprosy, anyone who contacted things touched by those with “a running discharge,” a man who had an emission of semen, a woman after menstruation or hemorrhaging, or anyone having sexual intercourse was “unclean” and had to bathe. (Le 14:8, 9; 15: 4-27) One in a tent with, or touching, a human corpse was “unclean” and had to be purified with cleansing water. If anyone refused to comply with this regulation, he “must be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because it is Jehovah’s sanctuary that he has defiled.” (Nu 19:20) Appropriately, then, washing is used figuratively to denote a clean standing before Jehovah. (Ps 26:6; 73:13; Isa 1:16; Eze 16:9) Bathing with Jehovah’s word of truth, symbolized by water, has power to cleanse.—Eph 5:26. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 15:28-30) </span><span class="font1">“ ‘However, when she is clean from her discharge, she will count for herself seven days, and afterward she will be clean. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span class="font1">On the eighth day, she should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and she will bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font1">The priest will make the one a sin offering and the other a burnt offering, and the priest will make atonement for her before Jehovah concerning her unclean discharge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Menstruation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The woman was also viewed as unclean for the duration of an irregular running discharge of blood or “a flow longer than her menstrual impurity,” at which time she made the articles on which she lay or sat as well as persons touching these items unclean. After the abnormal discharge ceased, she was to count seven days, and she then became clean. On the eighth day the woman brought two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, who made atonement for her, presenting one of these creatures to Jehovah as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.—Le 15:19-30; see CLEAN, CLEANNESS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 15:31) </span><span class="font1">“‘Thus you must keep the Israelites separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle, which is in their midst.</span></p>

(Ex 38:24; 2Ch 29:5; Ac 21:28) The primary items located in the courtyard were the altar of sacrifice and the copper basin. These were holy objects. Only those persons ceremonially clean could enter into the tabernacle courtyard at any time; likewise, no one could go into the temple courts in an unclean state. For example, a woman in the unclean state could not touch any holy thing or come into the holy place. (Le 12:2-4) Evidently even a state of continued uncleanness on the part of the Israelites was considered to be a defiling of the tabernacle. (Le 15:31) Those presenting offerings for cleansing from leprosy brought their sacrifice only as far as the gate of the courtyard. (Le 14:11) No unclean person could partake of a communion sacrifice at the tabernacle or the temple, on pain of death.—Le 7:20, 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ear</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the installation of the priesthood in Israel, Moses was commanded to take some of the blood of the ram of the installation and put it on the lobe of the right ear of Aaron and of each of his sons, as well as on the right hand and right foot, indicating that what they listened to, the work they did, and the way they walked should be directly affected by what was there taking place. (Le 8:22-24) Similarly, in the case of the cleansed leper, the Law said that the priest was to put some of the blood of the ram offered as a guilt offering, as well as some of the oil offered, on the lobe of the leper’s right ear. (Le 14:14, 17, 25, 28) An arrangement of comparable nature was found in the provision made for the man who wished to continue in slavery to his master to time indefinite. In such case the slave was to be brought to the doorpost, and his master was to pierce his ear through with an awl. This prominent mark, being made on the organ for hearing, evidently represented the slave’s desire to continue in obedient attention to his master.—Ex 21:5, 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mold—Friend and Foe!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MOLD IN BIBLE TIMES?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible mentions “the plague of leprosy in a house,” meaning in the building itself. (Leviticus 14:34-48) It has been suggested that this phenomenon, also called “malignant leprosy,” was a form of mildew or mold, but about this there is uncertainty. Whatever the case, God’s Law instructed homeowners to remove infected stones, scrape out the entire inside of the house, and discard all the suspect matter outside the city in “an unclean place.” If the plague returned, the whole house was to be declared unclean, pulled down, and disposed of. Jehovah’s detailed instructions reflected his deep love for his people and for their physical welfare.</span></p>

If the leper has been cured of the leprosy, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and he will set the living bird free in the open field. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">“The one cleansing himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he will be clean.

This is the first of three times he must enter the Most Holy on that day. In one hand, he holds a container filled with perfumed incense, and in the other, he balances a golden fire holder full of burning coals. He pauses before the curtain that covers the entrance to the Most Holy. With deep respect, he enters the Most Holy and stands before the ark of the covenant. In a symbolic sense, he is in the very presence of Jehovah God! Now the priest carefully pours the holy incense onto the fiery coals, and the room fills with a sweet-smelling aroma. Later he will reenter the Most Holy with the blood of the sin offerings. Notice that he burns the incense </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font1"> he presents the blood of the sin offerings.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font1"> What can we learn from the use of incense on Atonement Day? The Bible indicates that the acceptable prayers of Jehovah’s faithful worshippers are like incense. (Ps. 141:2; Rev. 5:8) Recall that it was with great respect that the high priest brought the incense into the presence of Jehovah. Similarly, when we approach Jehovah in prayer, we do so with deep respect. We are in awe of him. We deeply appreciate that the Creator of the universe allows us to approach him and draw close to him, as a child to a father. (Jas. 4:8) He accepts us as his friends! (Ps. 25:14) We appreciate this privilege so much that we would never want to disappoint him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 16:14, 15) </span><span class="font1">“He will take some of the bull’s blood and spatter it with his finger in front of the cover on the east side, and he will spatter some of the blood with his finger seven times before the cover. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">“He will then slaughter the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood the same as he did with the bull’s blood; he is to spatter it toward the cover and before the cover.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font1"> Remember that the high priest had to burn the incense </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font1"> he could offer up the sacrifices. In that way, he made sure that he would have God’s approval when offering up the sacrifices. What can we learn from that? While on earth, Jesus had to do something important—something more important than providing salvation for mankind—before he could offer up his life in sacrifice. What was that? By living a life of integrity and loyalty, Jesus had to prepare the way for Jehovah to accept his sacrifice. In that way, Jesus would prove that doing things Jehovah’s way is the right way to live. Jesus would vindicate—or prove right and just—his Father’s sovereignty, or way of ruling.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Azazel</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the apostle Paul explained, by Jesus’ offering of his own perfect human life as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, he accomplished far more than had been achieved by “the blood of bulls and of goats.” (Heb 10:4, 11, 12) He thus served as “the scapegoat,” being the ‘carrier of our sicknesses,’ the one “pierced for our transgression.” (Isa 53:4, 5; Mt 8:17; 1Pe 2:24) He ‘carried away’ the sins of all who exercise faith in the value of his sacrifice. He demonstrated the provision of God to take sinfulness into complete oblivion. In these ways the goat “for Azazel” pictures the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 17:10, 11) </span><span class="font1">“‘If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I myself have given it on the altar for you to make atonement for yourselves, because it is the blood that makes atonement by means of the life in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Why We Must Be Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Read Leviticus 17:10. </span><span class="font1">Jehovah commanded the Israelites not to eat “any sort of blood.” Abstaining from blood—animal or human—is a Christian requirement as well. (Acts 15:28,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">29) We shudder at the very thought of having God ‘set his face against us’ and cut us off from his congregation. We love him and want to obey him. Even when confronted with a lifethreatening situation, we are determined not to cave in to the pleas and demands of those who do not know Jehovah and who do not care to obey him. Yes, we expect to be ridiculed for abstaining from blood, but we choose to be obedient to God. (Jude 17, 18) What view on this subject will strengthen us to “be firmly resolved” not to eat blood or accept a blood transfusion? —Deut. 12:23.</span></p>

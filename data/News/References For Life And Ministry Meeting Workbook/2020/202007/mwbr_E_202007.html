<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Now You Will See What I Will Do to Pharaoh”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 6:1) </span><span class="font1">So Jehovah said to Moses: “Now you will see what I will do to Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh. A mighty hand will force him to send them away, and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out of his land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 6:6, 7) </span><span class="font1">“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery, and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font1">And I will take you in as my people, and I will be your God, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was a marked change in the men of Israel also. They had at first accepted Moses’ credentials, but after experiencing harder working conditions at the order of Pharaoh, they complained against him to the point that Moses in discouragement appealed to Jehovah. (Ex 4:29-31; 5:19-23) The Most High at that time strengthened him by revealing that He was now going to fulfill that for which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had looked, namely, the full revealing of the meaning of his name Jehovah in delivering Israel and establishing it as a great nation in the land of promise. (Ex 6:1-8) Even then the men of Israel did not listen to Moses. But now, after the ninth plague, they were solidly behind him, cooperating so that, after the tenth plague, he could organize them and lead them out in an orderly way, “in battle formation.”—Ex 13:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 7:4, 5) </span><span class="font1">But Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my multitudes, my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Before Pharaoh of Egypt.</span><span class="font1"> Moses and Aaron were now key figures in a ‘battle of the gods.’ In the persons of the magic-practicing priests, the chiefs of whom were apparently named Jannes and Jambres (2Ti 3:8), Pharaoh summoned the power of all the gods of Egypt against the power of Jehovah. The first miracle that Aaron performed before Pharaoh at Moses’ direction proved Jehovah’s supremacy over the gods of Egypt, even though Pharaoh became more obstinate. (Ex 7:8-13) Later, when the third plague occurred, even the priests were forced to admit, “It is the finger of God!” And they were so severely stricken by the plague of boils that they were altogether unable even to appear before Pharaoh to oppose Moses during that plague. —Ex 8:16-19; 9:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Plagues do softening and hardening work. </span><span class="font1">Moses and Aaron became the announcers of each of the Ten Plagues. The plagues came as announced, proving Moses’ commission as Jehovah’s representative. Jehovah’s name was declared and much talked about in Egypt, accomplishing both a softening and a hardening toward that name—softening the Israelites and some of the Egyptians; hardening Pharaoh and his advisers and supporters. (Ex 9:16; 11:10; 12:29-39) Instead of believing that they had offended their gods, the Egyptians </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">knew</span><span class="font1"> that it was Jehovah who was judging their gods. By the time nine plagues had been executed, Moses too had become “very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.”—Ex 11:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 6:3) </span><span class="font1">And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Almighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah used the title “God Almighty” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’El Shad-dai'</span><span class="font1">) when making his promise to Abraham concerning the birth of Isaac, a promise requiring that Abraham have great faith in God’s power to carry out that promise. It was thereafter used when God was spoken of as the one who would bless Isaac and Jacob as heirs of the Abrahamic covenant.—Ge 17:1; 28:3; 35: 11; 48:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In harmony with this, Jehovah could later say to Moses: “I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty [</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">be’EI' Shad-dai'</span><span class="font1">], but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.” (Ex 6:3) This could not mean that the name Jehovah was unknown to these patriarchs, since it was frequently used by them as well as by others before them. (Ge 4: 1, 26; 14:22; 27:27; 28:16) In fact, in the book of Genesis, which relates the lives of the patriarchs, the word “Almighty” occurs only 6 times, whereas the personal name Jehovah was written 172 times in the original Hebrew text. Yet, while these patriarchs had come to appreciate by personal experience God’s right to and qualifications for the title of “the Almighty One,” they had not had opportunity to appreciate the full meaning and implications of his personal name, Jehovah. In this regard, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Illustrated Bible Dictionary</span><span class="font1"> (Vol. 1, p. 572) comments: “The former revelation, to the Patriarchs, concerned promises belonging to a distant future; it supposed that they should be assured that He, Yahweh, was such a God (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’el</span><span class="font1">) as was competent (one possible meaning of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sadday</span><span class="font1">) to fulfill them. The revelation at the bush was greater and more intimate, God’s power and immediate and continuing presence with them being all wrapped up in the familiar name of Yahweh.” —Edited by J. D. Douglas, 1980.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 7:1) </span><span class="font1">Jehovah then said to Moses: “See, I have made you like God to Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moses not disqualified because of diffidence. </span><span class="font1">But Moses showed diffidence, arguing that he was unable to speak fluently. Here was a changed Moses, quite different from the one who had, of his own accord, offered himself as Israel’s deliverer 40 years earlier. He continued to remonstrate with Jehovah, finally asking Jehovah to excuse him from the task. Although this aroused God’s anger, he did not reject Moses but provided Moses’ brother Aaron as a mouthpiece. Thus, as Moses was representative for God, so Moses became as “God” to Aaron, who spoke representatively for him. In the ensuing meeting with the older men of Israel and the encounters with Pharaoh, it appears that God gave Moses the instructions and commands and Moses, in turn, relayed them to Aaron, so that Aaron did the actual speaking before Pharaoh (a successor of the Pharaoh from whom Moses had fled 40 years previously). (Ex 2:23; 4:1017) Later, Jehovah spoke of Aaron as Moses’ “prophet,” meaning that, as Moses was God’s prophet, directed by him, so Aaron should be directed by Moses. Also, Moses was told that he was being made “God to Pharaoh,” that is, given divine power and authority over Pharaoh, so that there was now no need to be afraid of the king of Egypt.—Ex 7:1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Proud Pharaoh Unwittingly Serves God’s Purpose”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 8:15) </span><span class="font1">When Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and he refused to listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6">-2 1040-1041</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Stubbornness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his dealings with humankind, Jehovah God has patiently allowed individuals and nations, although deserving of death, to continue in existence. (Ge 15:16; 2Pe 3:9) Whereas some have responded favorably to this by putting themselves in line for receiving mercy (Jos 2:814; 6:22, 23; 9:3-15), others have hardened themselves to an even greater degree against Jehovah and against his people. (De 2:30-33; Jos 11:19, 20) Since Jehovah does not prevent persons from becoming stubborn, he is spoken of as ‘letting them become obstinate’ or ‘making their hearts hard.’ When he finally does execute vengeance upon the stubborn ones, this results in a demonstration of his great power and causes his name to be declared. —Compare Ex 4:21; Joh 12:40; Ro 9:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 8:18, 19) </span><span class="font1">The magic-practicing priests tried to do the same and produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. And the gnats came on man and beast. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">So the magic-practicing priests said to Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh: “It is the finger of God!” But Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 9:15-17) </span><span class="font1">For by now I could have thrust my hand out to strike you and your people with a devastating plague, and you would have been wiped out from the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">But for this very reason I have kept you in existence: to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">Are you still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it-2</span><span class="font6"> 1181 p-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wickedness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Additionally, Jehovah God makes use of circumstances in such a way that the wicked themselves unwittingly serve his purpose. Though they oppose God, he can restrain them to the extent necessary for the preserving of his servants in their integrity, and can cause the actions even of such persons to bring his righteousness to the fore. (Ro 3:3-5, 23-26; 8:3539; Ps 76:10) This thought is expressed at Proverbs 16:4: “Everything Jehovah has made for his purpose, yes, even the wicked one for the evil day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A case in point is the Pharaoh on whom Jehovah, through Moses and Aaron, served notice for the release of the enslaved Israelites. God did not make this Egyptian ruler wicked, but he did allow him to continue living and also brought about circumstances that caused Pharaoh to manifest himself as being wicked and deserving of death. Jehovah’s purpose in doing this is revealed at Exodus 9:16: “For this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Ten Plagues visited upon Egypt, climaxed by the destruction of Pharaoh and his military forces in the Red Sea, were an impressive demonstration of Jehovah’s power. (Ex 7:14-12: 30; Ps 78:43-51; 136:15) For years afterward the nations round about were still talking about it, and God’s name was thus being declared throughout the earth. (Jos 2:10, 11; 1Sa 4:8) Had Jehovah killed Pharaoh immediately, this grand display of God’s power to His glory and for the deliverance of His people would not have been possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 8:21) </span><span class="font1">But if you do not send my people away, I will send on you, your servants, and your people and into your houses the gadfly; and the houses of Egypt will be full of gadflies, and they will even cover the ground they stand on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Gadfly</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is some uncertainty as to the particular insect designated by the original Hebrew word appearing in the Scriptures with reference to the fourth plague upon Egypt, the first from which the Israelites in Goshen were spared. (Ex 8:21, 22, 24, 29, 31; Ps 78:45; 105:31) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'A-rov' </span><span class="font1">has been variously rendered “gadfly” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">JB, NW, Ro</span><span class="font1">), “beetle” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yg</span><span class="font1">), “flies” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AS, KJ, RS</span><span class="font1">), “gnats” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AT</span><span class="font1">), and “dog fly” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">LXX</span><span class="font1">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The English designation “gadfly” includes the various kinds of horseflies and botflies. Female horseflies pierce the skin of animals as well as man and then suck their blood. In the larval stage botflies live as parasites in the bodies of animals and man; those that infest humans are found in the tropics. A plague of gadflies would, therefore, have brought great suffering to the Egyptians and their livestock and, in certain cases, even death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 8:25-27) </span><span class="font1">Finally, Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font1">But Moses said: “It is not proper to do so, because what we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we would make a sacrifice that was detestable to the Egyptians right before their eyes, would they not stone us? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font1">We will make a three-day journey into the wilderness, and there we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, just as he has said to us.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8:26, 2 7—Why did Moses say that Israel’s sacrifices would be “detestable to the Egyptians”?</span><span class="font1"> Many different animals were venerated in Egypt. The mention of sacrifices thus added force and persuasiveness to Moses’ insistence that Israel be allowed to go away to sacrifice to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Imitate Jesus—Preach With Boldness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font1"> Think, too, of the boldness that Moses showed in speaking to Pharaoh, a ruler who was viewed, not as a mere representative of the gods, but as a god himself, the son of the sun god Ra. It may be that he, like other Pharaohs, worshipped his own image. Pharaoh’s word was law; he ruled by decree. Powerful, arrogant, and stubborn, Pharaoh was not accustomed to having others tell him what to do. It was before this man that Moses, a meek shepherd, appeared repeatedly—unbidden and unwelcome. And what did Moses foretell? Devastating plagues. And what did he demand? Permission for several million of Pharaoh’s slaves to leave the country! Did Moses need boldness? Absolutely!—Num. 12:3; Heb. 11:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 10:24-26) </span><span class="font1">Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh then called Moses and said: “Go, serve Jehovah. Only your sheep and your cattle will remain behind. Even your children may go with you.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font1">But Moses said: “You yourself will also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings, and we will offer them to Jehovah our God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font1">Our livestock will also go with us. Not an animal will be allowed to remain, because we will be using some of them to worship Jehovah our God, and we do not know what we will offer in worship to Jehovah until we arrive there.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 10:28) </span><span class="font1">Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh said to him: “Get out of my sight! Make sure that you do not try to see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 11:4-8) </span><span class="font1">Moses then said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who is working at the hand mill, and every firstborn of the livestock. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">Throughout all the land of Egypt, there will be a great outcry such as has never occurred nor will ever occur again. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites, at the men or their livestock, so that you may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">And all your servants will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you.’ And after that I will go out.” With that he went out from Phar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">aoh in the heat of anger.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Courage and faith required to face Pharaoh.</span><span class="font1"> It was only in the strength of Jehovah and due to the operation of his spirit upon them that Moses and Aaron proved equal to the task set before them. Picture the court of Pharaoh, the king of the undisputed world power of that time. Here was unparalleled splendor, the haughty Pharaoh, supposed to be a god himself, surrounded by his advisers, military commanders, guards, and slaves. Moreover, there were the religious leaders, the magic-practicing priests, chief among Moses’ opposers. These men were, aside from Pharaoh himself, the most powerful men in the realm. All this impressive array was aligned to back up Pharaoh in support of the gods of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron came before Pharaoh, not once, but many times, Pharaoh’s heart getting harder each time, because he was determined to keep his valuable Hebrew slaves under his domination. In fact, after announcing the eighth plague, Moses and Aaron were driven out from before Pharaoh, and after the ninth plague they were ordered not to try to see Pharaoh’s face again on pain of death.—Ex 10:11, 28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Witnesses Against the False God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">While the Israelites were still in Egypt, Jehovah sent Moses to Pharaoh and said: “Go in to Pharaoh, because I—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him, and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 10:1, 2) Obedient Israelites would tell their children of Jehovah’s mighty acts. Their children, in turn, would tell of them to their children, and so it would be done from generation to generation. Thus, Jehovah’s powerful deeds would be remembered. Likewise today, parents have the responsibility of witnessing to their children. —Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Proverbs 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 11:7) </span><span class="font1">But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites, at the men or their livestock, so that you may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">So by a spectacular display of power Jehovah exalted his name and delivered Israel. Safe on the E shore of the Red Sea, Moses led the sons of Israel in a song, while his sister Miriam, the prophetess, took a tambourine in her hand and led all the women with tambourines and in dances, responding in song to the men. (Ex 15: 1, 20, 21) A complete separation of Israel from their foes had been effected. When they went out from Egypt they were not allowed to suffer harm from man or beast; no dog even snarled at the Israelites or moved its tongue against them. (Ex 11:7) While the Exodus narrative does not mention that Pharaoh personally went into the sea with his military forces and was destroyed, Psalm 136:15 does state that Jehovah “shook off Pharaoh and his military force into the Red Sea.”</span></p>

It is clear that you intend to do something evil. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">No!

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font1"> Jesus died on Nisan 14, 33 C.E. In Israel, Nisan 14 was the joyous day of the Passover celebration. Each year on that day, families shared a meal that included a young, unblemished lamb. In this way, they remembered the role that the blood of a lamb played in the deliverance of the Israelite firstborn when the angel of death slew the firstborn of the Egyptians on Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E. (Exodus 12:1-14) The Passover lamb foreshadowed Jesus, of whom the apostle Paul said: “Christ our passover has been sacrificed.” (1 Corinthians 5:7) Like the blood of the Passover lamb, Jesus’ shed blood provides salvation for many.—John 3:16, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 12:12, 13) </span><span class="font1">For I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">The blood will serve as your sign on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass over you, and the plague will not come on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Passover</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Certain features of the Passover observance were fulfilled by Jesus. One fulfillment lies in the fact that the blood on the houses in Egypt delivered the firstborn from destruction at the hands of the destroying angel. Paul speaks of anointed Christians as the congregation of the firstborn (Heb 12:23), and of Christ as their deliverer through his blood. (1Th 1:10; Eph 1:7) No bones were to be broken in the Passover lamb. It had been prophesied that none of Jesus’ bones would be broken, and this was fulfilled at his death. (Ps 34:20; Joh 19:36) Thus the Passover kept by the Jews for centuries was one of those things in which the Law provided a shadow of the things to come and pointed to Jesus Christ, “the Lamb of God.”—Heb 10:1; Joh 1:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 12:24-27) </span><span class="font1">“You must observe this event as a lasting regulation for you and your sons. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font1">And when you come into the land that Jehovah will give you just as he has stated, you must keep this observance. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font1">And when your sons ask you, ‘What does this observance mean to you?’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font1">you must say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he plagued the Egyptians, but he spared our houses.’” Then the people bowed low and prostrated themselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font1"> As new generations grew up, important lessons would be emphasized, passed on by father to son. One was that Jehovah could protect his worshippers. The children learned that he is not some vague, abstract deity. Jehovah is a real, living God who is interested in his people and who acts in their behalf. He proved this at the time he protected the Israelite firstborn “when he plagued the Egyptians.” He kept the firstborn alive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font1"> Christian parents do not each year recount to their sons and daughters the meaning of that Passover. Do you, however, teach your children this same lesson—that God protects his people? Do you convey to them your deep conviction that Jehovah is still a real Protector of his people? (Ps. 27:11; Isa. 12:2) And do you do that, not in the form of a cold lecture, but in an enjoyable conversation between you and your children? Make an effort to include that lesson to stimulate your family’s spiritual growth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">The Ten Plagues upon Egypt all proved to be a judgment against the gods of Egypt, especially the tenth, the death of the firstborn. (Ex 12:12) For the ram (male sheep) was sacred to the god Ra, so that splashing the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorways would be blasphemy in the eyes of the Egyptians. Also, the bull was sacred, and the destruction of the firstborn of the bulls would be a blow to the god Osiris. Pharaoh himself was venerated as a son of Ra. The death of Pharaoh’s own firstborn would thus show the impotence of both Ra and Pharaoh.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A unique feature of all of these “holy conventions” was that during them the people were to do no laborious work. For instance, the first and seventh days of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes were “holy conventions,” concerning which Jehovah stated: “No work is to be done on them. Only what every soul needs to eat, that alone may be done for you.” (Ex 12:15, 16) However, during “holy conventions” the priests were busy offering sacrifices to Jehovah (Le 23:37, 38), certainly no violation of any command against doing normal daily work. These occasions were not periods of idleness for the people in general either but were times of great spiritual benefit. On the weekly Sabbath day, the people met together for public worship and instruction. They were then edified by the public reading and explanation of God’s written Word, as in the later synagogues. (Ac 15:21) Therefore, while the people did not do laborious work during the Sabbath day or the other “holy conventions,” they would then devote themselves to prayer and meditation on the Creator and his purposes.—See ASSEMBLY.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 12:1-20) </span><span class="font1">Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">“This month will be the beginning of the months for you. It will be the first of the months of the year for you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they should each take for themselves a sheep for their father’s house, a sheep to a house. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">But if the household is too small for the sheep, they and their nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their house according to the number of people. When making the calculation, determine how much of the sheep each one will eat. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">Your sheep should be a sound, one-year-old male. You may choose from the young rams or from the goats. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">You must care for it until the 14th day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">They must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">“‘They must eat the meat on this night. They should roast it over the fire and eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter greens. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, cooked in water, but roast it over the fire, its head together with its shanks and its inner parts. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">You must not save any of it until morning, but any of it left over until morning you should burn with fire. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">And this is how you should eat it, with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">your belt fastened, sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you should eat it in a hurry. It is Jehovah’s Passover. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">For I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">The blood will serve as your sign on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass over you, and the plague will not come on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">“‘This day will serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a lasting statute, you should celebrate it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread. Yes, on the first day you are to remove the sourdough from your houses, because anyone eating what is leavened from the first day down to the seventh, that person must be cut off from Israel. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">On the first day you will hold a holy convention, and on the seventh day, another holy convention. No work is to be done on these days. Only what every person needs to eat, that alone may be prepared for you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">“‘You must keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day, I will bring your multitudes out of the land of Egypt. And you must keep this day throughout your generations as a lasting statute. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, in the evening, you are to eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month, in the evening. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">No sourdough is to be found in your houses for seven days, because if anyone eats what is leavened, whether he is a foreigner or a native of the land, that person must be cut off from the assembly of Israel. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font1">You should not eat anything leavened. In all your homes, you are to eat unleavened bread.’”</span></p>

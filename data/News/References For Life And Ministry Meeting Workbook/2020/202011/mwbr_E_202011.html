<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 39:32) </span><span class="font1">So all the work for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed, and the Israelites did everything that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are You Known by Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font7"> In contrast, Moses was “by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground.” (Num. 12:3) He manifested his meekness and humility by his determination to follow Jehovah’s direction. (Ex. 7:6; 40:16) There is no indication that Moses often questioned Jehovah’s way of doing things or got annoyed at having to follow procedures that Jehovah set out. For example, Jehovah gave commands regarding the tabernacle construction down to the smallest detail, such as the color of the thread and the number of loops to be used in making the tent cloths. (Ex. 26:1-6) If a human overseer in God’s organization provides you with instructions that seem extremely detailed, you might at times feel frustrated. Jehovah, however, is a perfect overseer, who delegates generously and trusts his servants. When he gives many details, he does so for good reason. Take note, though, that Moses did not become irritated with Jehovah for giving that level of detail, as if Jehovah were demeaning him or stifling his creativity or freedom. Rather, Moses made sure that the workers “did just so” in following God’s directions. (Ex. 39:32) What a humble course! Moses recognized that it was Jehovah’s work and that he was just a tool being used to get that work done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 39:43) </span><span class="font1">When Moses inspected all their work, he saw that they had done it just as Jehovah had commanded; and Moses blessed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 40:1, 2) </span><span class="font1">Then Jehovah said to Moses: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">“On the first day of the first month, you are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exodus 40:16) </span><span class="font1">Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Faithful in All Things?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font7">“Moses as an attendant was faithful,” states Hebrews 3:5. What made the prophet Moses faithful? In the construction and setting up of the tabernacle, “Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.” (Exodus 40:16) As worshippers of Jehovah, we show faithfulness by obediently serving him. This certainly includes our remaining loyal to Jehovah while facing difficult tests or severe trials. However, success in dealing with big tests is not the sole factor that determines our faithfulness. “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much,” stated Jesus, “and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” (Luke 16:10) We must remain faithful even in seemingly small matters.</span></p>

While seals are generally associated with Arctic and Antarctic regions, some seals favor warmer climates. Today a few monk seals still inhabit part of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as other warmer waters. Over the centuries man has greatly reduced the number of seals, and in Bible times these animals may have been abundant in the Mediterranean and in the Red Sea. As late as 1832 an English edition of Calmet’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Holy Bible</span><span class="font7"> (p. 139) observed: “On many of the small islands of the Red sea, around the peninsula of Sinai, are found seals.”—See also </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Tabernacle’s Typical Teaching,</span><span class="font7"> by A.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Does It Matter Who Notices Your Work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the tabernacle was completed, a cloud “began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.” (Ex. 40:34) What a clear indication of Jehovah’s approval! How do you think Bezalel and Oholiab felt at that moment? Although their names were not engraved on their handiwork, they must have felt satisfaction in knowing that God’s blessing was on all their efforts. (Prov. 10:22) In the years that followed, it surely warmed their hearts to see that their handiwork continued to be used in Jehovah’s service. When they come back to life in the new world, Bezalel and Oho-liab will no doubt be thrilled to learn that the tabernacle was used in true worship for some 500 years!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Offerings</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Burnt offerings.</span><span class="font7"> Burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God; no part of the animal being retained by the worshiper. (Compare Jg 11:30, 31, 39, 40.) They constituted an appeal to Jehovah to accept, or to signify acceptance of, the sin offering that sometimes accompanied them. As a “burnt offering” Jesus Christ gave himself wholly, fully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Offerings</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Grain offerings.</span><span class="font7"> Grain offerings were made along with communion offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and also as firstfruits; at other times they were made independently. (Ex 29:40-42; Le 23:10-13, 15-18; Nu 15:8, 9, 22-24; 28:9, 10, 20, 26-28; chap 29) These were in recognition of God’s bounty in supplying blessings and prosperity. They were often accompanied by oil and frankincense. Grain offerings could be in the form of fine flour, roasted grain, or ringshaped cakes or wafers that were baked, griddle cooked, or from the deep-fat kettle. Some of the grain offering was put on the altar of burnt offering, some was eaten by the priests, and in communion offerings the worshiper partook. (Le 6:14-23; 7:11-13; Nu 18:8-11) None of the grain offerings presented on the altar could contain leaven or “honey” (apparently referring to the syrup of figs or juice of fruits) that might fer-ment.—Le 2:1-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 3:1) </span><span class="font1">“‘If his offering is a communion sacrifice and if he is presenting it from the herd, whether a male or a female, he should present a sound animal before Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Communion offerings (or peace offerings). </span><span class="font7">Communion offerings acceptable to Jehovah denoted peace with him. The worshiper and his household partook (in the courtyard of the tabernacle; according to tradition, booths were set up around the inside of the curtain surrounding the courtyard; in the temple, dining rooms were provided). The officiating priest received a portion, and the priests on duty, another portion. Jehovah, in effect, received the pleasing smoke of the burning fat. The blood, representing the life, was given to God as his. Therefore the priests, the worshipers, and Jehovah were as if together at the meal, signifying peaceful relationships. The person partaking while in a state of uncleanness (any of the uncleannesses mentioned in the Law) or who ate the flesh after it had been kept beyond the prescribed time (in the warm climate it would begin to putrefy) was to be cut off from his people. He defiled or desecrated the meal, because of either being unclean himself or eating that which was foul before Jehovah God, showing disrespect for sacred things.—Le 7:16-21; 19:5-8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">2:13—Why did salt have to be presented “with every offering”? </span><span class="font7">This was not done to enhance the flavor of the sacrifices. Around the world, salt is used as a preservative. It was likely presented with offerings because it represents freedom from corruption and decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 3:17) </span><span class="font1">“‘It is a lasting statute for your generations, in all your dwelling places: You must not eat any fat or any blood at all.’” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 813 Fat</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reason for the law.</span><span class="font7"> Under the Law covenant, both the blood and fat were looked upon as exclusively Jehovah’s. The blood contains the life, which only Jehovah can give; therefore it belongs to him. (Le 17:11, 14) The fat was viewed as the richest part of the flesh of the animal. The offering of the fat of the animal would evidently be in recognition of the fact that the best parts belong to Jehovah, who provides abundantly, and it would demonstrate the desire of the worshiper to offer the best to God. Because it was symbolic of the Israelites’ devotion of their best to Jehovah, it was said to smoke upon the altar as “food” and for “a restful odor” to him. (Le 3:11, 16) To eat fat, therefore, was an illegal appropriation of what was sanctified to God, an invasion of the rights of Jehovah. Eating fat would incur the death penalty. Unlike blood, however, fat could be used for other purposes, at least in the case of an animal that died of itself or was killed by another beast.—Le 7:23-25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3:17. </span><span class="font7">Since the fat was regarded as the best or the richest part, the prohibition against eating it evidently impressed upon the Israelites that the best part belonged to Jehovah. (Genesis 45: 18) This reminds us that we should give our very best to Jehovah.—Proverbs 3:9, 10; Colos-sians 3:23, 24.</span></p>

Either a right of Jehovah or a right of his holy nation had been violated. The guilt offering was to satisfy Jehovah on the right that had been violated, or to restore or recover certain covenant rights for the repentant wrongdoer and to get relief from the penalty for his sin.—Compare Isa 53:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 5:7) </span><span class="font1">“‘If, though, he cannot afford a sheep, he must bring to Jehovah two turtledoves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the sin, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">He Is Considerate of Our Limitations</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reflecting Jehovah’s tender consideration, the Law said: “If, though, he cannot afford enough for a sheep, then he must bring as his guilt offering for the sin that he has committed two turtledoves or two young pigeons to Jehovah.” (Verse 7) The phrase “if . . . he cannot afford” may also be rendered “if . . . his hand cannot reach.” If an Israelite was too poor to afford a sheep, then God was pleased to accept something that was within the offerer’s reach—two turtledoves or two pigeons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 5:11) </span><span class="font1">“‘Now if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he must bring as his offering for his sin a tenth of an e</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font1">phah of fine flour for a sin offering.

<p><span class="font7">What if the individual did not have the means even for the two birds? “Then he must bring as his offering for the sin he has committed the tenth of an ephah [eight or nine cups] of fine flour for a sin offering,” the Law stated. (Verse 11) For the very poor, Jehovah chose to make an exception and allow a sin offering without blood. In Israel, poverty denied no one the blessing of atonement or the privilege of making peace with God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font7"> Kindness can help you to deal with a conflict of loyalties. For example, you may have definite knowledge that a certain fellow believer is guilty of serious misconduct. You may feel loyal to him, especially if he is a close friend or a relative. But if you were to cover up the wrongdoing, you would be disloyal to God. Of course, your loyalty to Jehovah should come first. So like Nathan, be kind yet firm. Urge your friend or relative to seek the help of the elders. If he or she does not do so within a reasonable period of time, loyalty to God should move you to report the matter to the elders. In doing this, you are being loyal to Jehovah and kind to your friend or relative, for Christian elders will try to readjust such an individual with mildness. —</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Read Leviticus 5:1; Galatians 6:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Animals and Produce. </span><span class="font7">The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed. They were to be sacrificed, and a portion went to the sanctified priests. (Nu 18:17-19) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (Ex 28:38) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.—Le 5: 14-16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lessons We Can Learn From the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Second lesson: We serve Jehovah because we are grateful to him.</span><span class="font7"> To highlight this, let us consider the communion offerings, another important aspect of true worship in ancient Israel. In the book of Leviticus, we learn that an Israelite could offer a communion sacrifice “as an expression of thanksgiving.” (Lev. 7:11-13, 1618) He made this offering, not because he had to, but because he wanted to. So this was a voluntary offering that the individual made because he loved his God, Jehovah. The person making the offering, his family, and the priests would eat the meat of the sacrificed animal. But certain parts of the animal sacrifice were offered up exclusively to Jehovah. Which parts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 7:13-15) </span><span class="font1">He will present his offering along with ring-shaped loaves of leavened bread and the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">He is to present from it one of each offering as a sacred portion to Jehovah; it will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the communion sacrifices. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices is to be eaten on the day he offers it. He must not save any of it until morning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sacrifices That Pleased God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font7">Another voluntary offering was the communion sacrifice, described in Leviticus chapter 3. The name can also be translated “a sacrifice of peace offerings.” In Hebrew, the word “peace” denotes much more than simply being free from war or disturbance. “In the Bible, it denotes this, and also the state or relation of peace with God, prosperity, joy, and happiness,” says the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Studies in the Mosaic Institutions.</span><span class="font7"> Thus, communion sacrifices were offered, not to secure peace with God, as if to appease him, but to express gratitude for or to celebrate the blessed condition of peace with God enjoyed by those who are approved by him. The priests and the offerer partook of the sacrifice after the blood and fat were offered to Jehovah. (Leviticus 3: 17; 7:16-21; 19:5-8) In a beautiful and symbolic way, the offerer, the priests, and Jehovah God were sharing in a meal, signifying the peaceful relationship that existed among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 7:20) </span><span class="font1">“‘But any person who is unclean and eats the flesh of the communion sacrifice, which is for Jehovah, that person must be cut off from his people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sacrifices of Praise That Please Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font7">What of the person making the offering? The Law stated that anyone coming before Jehovah had to be clean and undefiled. Someone who had become defiled for any reason first had to offer a sin or guilt offering to restore his clean standing before Jehovah so that his burnt offering or communion sacrifice could be acceptable to Him. (Leviticus 5:1-6, 15, 17) Do we, therefore, appreciate the importance of always maintaining a clean standing before Jehovah? If we want our worship to be acceptable to God, we must be swift about correcting any infractions of God’s laws. We should be quick to avail ourselves of the God-given means for help—“the older men of the congregation” and the “propitiatory sacrifice for our sins,” Jesus Christ. —James 5:14; 1 John 2:1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 6:13) </span><span class="font1">Fire will be kept constantly burning on the altar. It must not go out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As relates to the tabernacle and the temple.</span><span class="font7"> Fire figured in the worship carried on at the tabernacle and then later at the temple. Each morning and between the two evenings, the high priest was to burn incense on the altar of incense. (Ex 30:7, 8) God’s law required that the fire on the altar of burnt offering be kept burning continually. (Le 6:12, 13) The traditional Jewish view that the altar fire was originally kindled miraculously by God, though widely accepted, is not actually supported by the Scriptures. According to Jehovah’s initial instructions to Moses, the sons of Aaron were to “put fire on the altar and set wood in order on the fire” before placing the sacrifice on the altar. (Le 1:7, 8) It was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font7"> the installation of the Aaronic priesthood, and therefore after the installation sacrifices had been offered, that fire from Jehovah, probably proceeding from the cloud over the tabernacle, consumed the offering then upon the altar. In view of this, the miraculous fire manifested itself, not in kindling the wood on the altar, but in “consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar.” The fire that then continued to burn on the altar, of course, was likely a result of the mixture of the fire from God and the fire already on the altar. (Le 8:14-9:24) Likewise, miraculous fire from Jehovah consumed the sacrifices right after Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple.—2Ch 7:1; see also Jg 6:21; 1Ki 18:21-39; 1Ch 21:26 for other examples of Jehovah’s use of miraculous fire when accepting the offerings of his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 6:25) </span><span class="font1">“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will also be slaughtered before Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font7">(3) A sin offering is required for unintentional sins, or sins committed by mistake. The type of animal offered depends upon whose sin is being atoned for—that of the priest, the people as a whole, a chieftain, or an ordinary person. Unlike the voluntary burnt and communion offerings for individuals, the sin offering is mandatory. —4:1-35; 6:24-30.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Moses washed Aaron and Aaron’s sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar (or, he commanded them to wash themselves) at the copper basin in the courtyard and put upon Aaron the glorious garments of the high priest. (Nu 3:2, 3) Now clothed in beautiful apparel, Aaron was invested with the garments representing the qualities and responsibilities of his office. Moses then anointed the tabernacle, all its furnishings and utensils, and the altar of burnt offering, as well as the basin and the utensils used in connection with them. This sanctified them, set them aside for the exclusive use and service of God for which they would now be employed. Finally Moses anointed Aaron by pouring the oil upon his head.—Le 8:6-12; Ex 30:22-33; Ps 133:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 9:1-5) </span><span class="font1">On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">He said to Aaron: “Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">But you will say to the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices, to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Jehovah will appear to you.’ ” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">On the eighth day, fully equipped and installed in office, the priesthood officiated (without Moses’ assistance) for the first time, performing an atonement service for the nation of Israel, especially in need of cleansing not only because of their natural sinfulness but also because of their recent disobedience in connection with the golden calf, which had brought Jehovah’s displeasure. (Le 9:1-7; Ex 32:1-10) At the conclusion of this first service by the newly installed priesthood, Jehovah manifested his approval and confirmation of them in office by sending miraculous fire, doubtless from the pillar of cloud above the tabernacle, devouring the remainder of the sacrifice on the altar.—Le 9: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 9:23, 24) </span><span class="font1">Finally Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lessons We Can Learn From the Book of Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fourth lesson: Jehovah is blessing the earthly part of his organization.</span><span class="font7"> Consider what happened in 1512 B.C.E. when the tabernacle was set up at the foot of Mount Sinai. (Ex. 40:17) Moses presided over a ceremony to install Aaron and his sons as priests. The nation of Israel assembled to witness the priests presenting their first animal sacrifices. (Lev. 9:1-5) How did Jehovah show his approval of the newly installed priesthood? As Aaron and Moses blessed the people, Jehovah caused fire to consume the remainder of the sacrifice on the altar. —</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Read Leviticus 9:23, 24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why We Must Be Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font7">The requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean has real meaning for Jehovah’s people today. Those with whom we study the Bible often notice that our places of worship are clean and also how neat and well-dressed we are. Yet, the cleanness of the priesthood helps us to realize that anyone who ascends the elevated mountain of Jehovah’s worship must have “a pure heart.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Psalm 24:3, 4; </span><span class="font7">Isa. 2: 2, 3.) Our sacred service to God must be rendered with cleansed minds and hearts as well as with clean bodies. This calls for frequent self-examination, after which some may need to make significant changes so that they can be holy. (2 Cor. 13:5) For instance, a baptized person who deliberately views pornography should ask himself, ‘Am I proving myself holy?’ Then he ought to get help to end that vile practice.—Jas. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 8:14-17) </span><span class="font1">Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">Moses slaughtered it and took the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides, and he purified the altar from sin, but the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar, in order to sanctify it to make atonement on it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">After that he took all the fat that was on the intestines, the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses made them smoke on the altar. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then he had the rest of the bull, its skin, its flesh, and its dung,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Moses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God constituted Moses mediator of the Law covenant with Israel, an intimate position such as no man has ever held before God except Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant. With the blood of animal sacrifices Moses sprinkled the book of the covenant, representing Jehovah as one “party,” and the people (no doubt the representative older men) as the other “party.” He read the book of the covenant to the people, who replied, “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do and be obedient.” (Ex 24:3-8; Heb 9:19) In his office of mediator, Moses was privileged to oversee the building of the tabernacle and the making of its utensils, the pattern of which God gave to him, and to install the priesthood in office, anointing the tabernacle and Aaron the high priest with the oil of special composition. Then he took oversight of the first official services of the newly consecrated priesthood.—Ex chaps 25-29; Le chaps 8, 9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Leviticus 8:31-9:7) </span><span class="font1">Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and you will eat it there with the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was commanded, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>32</sup> </span><span class="font1">What is left over of the flesh and the bread you will burn with fire. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>33</sup> </span><span class="font1">You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days for completing your installation are over, because it will take seven days to install you as priests. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>34</sup> </span><span class="font1">Jehovah commanded that we do what we have done today in order to make atonement for you. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>35</sup> </span><span class="font1">You will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and carry out your obligation to Jehovah, so that you may not die; for so I have been commanded.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>36</sup> </span><span class="font1">And Aaron and his sons did all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font1">On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">He said to Aaron: “Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">But you will say to the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices, to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Jehovah will appear to you.’ ” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting. Then the whole assembly came forward and stood before Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">And Moses said: “This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, so that the glory of Jehovah may appear to you.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then Moses said to Aaron: “Approach the altar and present your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement in your own behalf and in behalf of your house; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement in their behalf, just as Jehovah has commanded.”</span></p>

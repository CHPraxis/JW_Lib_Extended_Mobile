<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—Luke 21:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL XII NO. 9</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Dea/t ^PubMe/ts:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Here we are with another service year behind us, and what a grand year it was! We had thrilling results with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book and ■ the six-month home Bible-study arrangement, didn't we? And now the “Peace on Earth” International Assembly has built us up and stimulated us for even greater activity during the year to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">En route from the Chicago assembly to the ones in Europe, Brother Knorr stopped at Bethel for a few hours. At the breakfast table he told us that right here in North America during July, 492,310 had attended the convention public talk and 12,894 had been baptized! Isn't that grand? Then, without even staying to eat breakfast, he left to catch the plane for London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">September is the month when many of you young folks go back to school, isn't it? We have been thinking about that. Don’t you agree that as a result of the assembly drama “Let No Man Ever Look Down on Your Youth,” along with all the fine talks, you are better equipped to avoid entanglements with the world? Also, there in school you are in position to do a lot of witnessing to persons who very much need the truth but whom others of us often find it difficult to reach. Class discussions and personal conversations open the way to use material such as is found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">articles too can open the way for good discussions. And, of course, you can tell others about the grand assembly that you attended this past summer. No doubt you have thought about such possibilities, and surely you will have fine experiences as you take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With summer past, this would be a good time for all of us to make any needed adjustments in our service schedules. As shown by the fine attendance at the assemblies, and as is evident in our field ministry, there are tens of thousands of persons who are still</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Implanting the Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">'The disciple James, after urging us to put away all moral badness, tells us to “accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save your souls.” And that is what we want to do, isn’t it? We want, not only to know the word, but to get it deeply </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">implanted</span><span class="font10"> in us. Then we will do as James further says, ‘becoming doers of the word, and not hearers only.’ So the good news that we have received roust go deeper than our minds. It must be in our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hearts, </span><span class="font10">so that we appreciate it and act in harmony with it.—Jas. 1: 21, 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Having our hearts filled with the good news, we can implant it in others whose hearts are receptive. When we speak from the heart we do so enthusiastically, with feeling, so that our hearers will realize the importance of what we are saying. Yet we also speak with mildness so that they, too, will be aided to “accept with mildness the implanting of the word.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> That is the spirit that we found at the “Peace on Earth” assemblies this past summer, isn’t it? And how our hearts were moved! As a result we have a wealth of fine information to use to aid others to accept “the implanting of the word.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> As we know from experience, the progress in “implanting the word” is usually fastest when we conduct regular home Bible studies with interested ones. At the assemblies, it was wonderful to learn that 1,218,315 of such home Bible hungry for the truth. Now, while there is still opportunity, let’s give them all the help we can—if possible, studying with them regularly in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">May Jehovah continue to bless your efforts as you watch yourself and your teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">studies were being conducted throughout the world last April, and the results are manifest in large increases in the number of praisers of Jehovah. This feature of our ministry should continue to receive emphasis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is not difficult to place the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, and we will continue to do so during September. But we should also put heavy stress on making return calls on everyone who obtains the book, with a view to starting home Bible studies. If there are any homes where you placed the book but have not called back, we urge you to make the return calls now, even though a number of months may have elapsed. Then when you call, carefully explain to them about our free six-month Bible-study arrangement, and, if possible, demonstrate it, starting with the first chapter. In this way you can help them to get acquainted with Jehovah, learn the truth from his Word, and get free from Babylon the Great while there is yet time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Just as we did during the past year, we will continue to handle the studies in a progressive manner. Right from the start, teach the interested ones to prepare their lesson. Encourage them to do additional reading. Invite them to the meetings. If, in six months, they are not taking positive steps to follow through on what they are learning, then we will use that time to aid others. But if they are responding, it will be a pleasure patiently to help them, even after baptism, to become mature servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> During September, those congregations that are working unassigned territory will continue to give it their special attention. Endeavor to reach every home. And then continue to show a personal interest in those who manifest interest. If you can call back, do so;</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">(Part 2) Helping Others to Know God. What are the concepts of God held by people in our own territory? How can we answer them? Do they think he does not exist? Do they think he lives but is not interested in man? Is he a God afar off? Will he do anything? Does he have anything to do with happenings today? Where did he come from? Should we hesitate to use his name Jehovah before all the people? What are the benefits from declaring his name? Is God omnipresent? a trinity? How can we use the Bible to help them learn about God?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">*10 min: Talk on theme; see “Watchtower” of October 1, 1969. Emphasize that, while our commission involves assaulting false religion, it also includes preaching a message of salvation to those who w’ill hear, and thus the Christian’s commission today is similar to that of Jeremiah’s, “to uproot and to pull down and to destroy and to tear down, to build and to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">► plant.”—Jer. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Question Box. Magazineterritory servant discusses how all can contribute to thorough territory coverage and can assist him in keeping accurate records. Review how congregation is doing- in covering territory with the good news. Do certain sections need better coverage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Introduction and presenting the subscription offer. You may use any sermon that is effective for you, or you may find the following sermon helpful</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Law and Order Enforced by God Devil responsible for breakdown in law and order.—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Devil angry because Kingdom established in heaven and he has been</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Rejoice that Devil and his system soon to be destroyed. (Refer again to latter part of Rev. 12:12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suggested presentation: “Hello. I’ve stopped by as a neighbor to discuss with you briefly a topic we hear a lot about these days, that of law and order. I’m sure you’re concerned with the breakdown in law and order, just as I am. What do you feel about the future? Do you see any hope for improvement? [Allow householder to express self.] It may be surprising to you to learn the real reason conditions are so bad now and getting worse. The Bible puts the finger on the one really responsible. Note what is said at Revelation 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;A few verses earlier (12:9. 10) we learn the reason why the Devil is very angry and causing such havoc on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“How encouraging it is, though, to know that these terrible conditions will soon end, with the cause of the trouble removed. Note again what is stated in verse 12, that the Devil 'has a short period of time.’ God’s kingdom has already been established in the heavens and soon will bring in permanent peace and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To help you (and your family) to learn how God will enforce law and order on earth soon, we invite you to subscribe for ‘Awake’’ (and ‘The Watchtower,’ if offered in combination).” (Present special issues.) The above sermon can be first discussed with congregation to get ideas well in mind. Then prepared publisher can demonstrate to audience. If time permits, several different introductions might be presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">July was a busy month for all of us, wasn’t it? The outstanding attendance at the “Peace on Earth” International Assemblies indicates we successfully encouraged many interested persons to be there with us and what a rich blessing we all received! Too, we made w’ise use of the remaining time during the month by having a fine share in the field ministry, placing over one-half million books and 4,742,885 magazines. How encouraging to realize that the Kingdom message continues to flow so abundantly in these perilous “last days.” Did you notice that w-e have another new peak in pioneer praisers of Jehovah? Isn’t it gratifying to see more and more entering the full-time service! If you are in a position to vacation or regular pioneer, why delay? Now let us look confidently to Jehovah for his continued blessing upon our zealous efforts throughout this new service year.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching at the Congregation Book Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Tile congregation book study is a provision of Jehovah by which we can advance to deeper understanding of the Bible and improve our ability to express ourselves. At this meeting we can receive more personal assistance in sharing in the good things that Jehovah is giving his people in a spiritual way. (Gal. 6:6) We can overcome timidity, so that we can share also in commenting at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">study at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The purpose of the study is to assist </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font10"> both new ones and those long in the truth, to a better understanding of Jehovah and his purposes, and in advancement to maturity. Therefore the book study servant and those attending should have a positive attitude about the benefits of the study. They should not feel that publications such as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font10"> book are too deep, too difficult. The apostle tells us; “Now that we have left the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity,” and, “Solid food belongs to mature people.” (Heb. 6:1; 5:14) Do we not want to know the more advanced things God has written in his Word? Do we not want to progress from ‘babyhood’? (Heb. 5:12, 13) Do we not see the need for this? We should read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, of course. We should study it with others. But solid meat is what we want as spiritual grownups. Even ones newly attending the studies can grasp these things surprisingly well, as has been proved by their attendance and often by their commenting at the study. It is Jehovah’s “food at the proper time,” and we need to eat it. If we neglect it when the Lord sets it before us now, we may lose out when severe tests come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> The foundation truths are important indeed, hut the fulfillment of prophecy in world history before our eyes today is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">faith strengthening.</span><span class="font10"> It keeps us spiritually alive, active, able to help someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What about coverage of material? A reasonable amount should be covered. Points that are deeper can be discussed more thoroughly, but it is good not to dwell excessively on any paragraph. Often a point not clearly understood at first </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Implanting the Word &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(ConVd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">or offer to study with them through the mail. Many fine results have come from doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> With hearts moved by God’s Word, then, we will continue to go ahead zealously with our work, and ‘the God of love and of peace will be with us.’—2 Cor. 13:11. is very easy to understand a little later in the study because of its connection with other points. In other words, things sometimes fall Into place easily when one sees the overall pattern. Also, everyone wants to get all possible benefit out of the hour set aSide for the study. If a reasonable amount of material is covered, many other even more important facts may be learned. To keep up with the group it is essential that the lesson be Studied in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The conductor can aid all by sticking closely to the questions in the book. If the question is long the conductor may want to break it into two parts. Auxiliary questions may be asked if the real point of the question was missed. But he should not feel obligated to squeeze out every point in the paragraph. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Getting the printed question answered and applying the scriptures are the main things</span><span class="font10"> that make the study profitable. If the study is handled in this manner, those attending will get understanding and will feel that they are moving along with accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazines for Use in October</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In the midst of a great breakdown of law and order there is an increasing cry for ‘law and order.’ But from whom will law and order come? When? How? These are all questions on the minds of people everywhere. How appropriate, then, that the entire October 8 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> should be a special one devoted to how law and order will be enforced by God and his kingdom. It speaks frankly of man’s failure to bring law and order, while clearly outlining what Jehovah will do '.in bringing law and order for all mankind very soon. Lawlessness, injustice, discrimination, bad living conditions, yes, even sin and death will be eliminated. Then the question is squarely put to all: Do you really want this kind of law and order? What a pleasure it will be to present to the people this issue on this timely subject!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In addition, the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will be a special one, containing as its feature article the public talk, “The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years,’’ given at the assemblies this summer. The two issues of the magazines complement each other very well. Now is the time to speak with your magazine-territory servant and let him know how many of these special issues you will need during October. Will this be our best month for magazine placements yet? We will look to Jehovah for his blessing, as we do not forget to return to water -the seeds of truth in an effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">foreign, we have no plans for producing the above-mentioned special items in the near future. When they are available again, we will notify you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Plans are being made for six special public talks, to be put on by each congregation during January, February and March. There will be two each month; and we suggest that they be scheduled as early. in the month as convenient, making any necessary allowance for the visit of the circuit servant and for your circuit assembly, at which times the regularly scheduled public talks will be given. Others of the current public talks may be given on the intermediate weeks. The titles of the special talks are: (1) Bible Accounts of Creation and Flood—Fact or Fiction? </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(2)</span><span class="font9"> Is the Bible Record Really Historical Fact? (3) The Bible—Contradictory or Consistent? (4) Bible Prophecies Involve Your Life. (5) Practical Counsel Provided by God for Man. (6) The Churches or the Bible—Which Do You Choose? Where possible, put them on in the order listed. Detailed instructions for these talks will be provided with the December </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> If you have already ordered handbills for the months listed, then schedule these talks at some other time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To Other Members of the Family</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When engaging in the ministry we often contact individuals who show good interest in the truth, but we do not always meet the other members of their family, do we? For example, you sisters ire’ quently study with wives during the day. Is there anything that you can do to draw their husbands into the discussions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some married sisters have, right at the outset, suggested bringing their husbands on the next visit, and have arranged the return call at a time when the husband of the householder would be at home. But if your circumstances require that you have the study at an hour when the husband is not at home, perhaps you can arrange for a brother to call on him at a convenient time. Ue needs to hear the good news too, doesn’t he?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Regardless of how it is done, the value of seeking to include the husband in the Bible study has time and again been demonstrated. Probably in your own congregation there are brothers who are grateful that the publisher who studied with their wives made an effort to include them in the study. The RM9 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> gives some interesting examples. In one instance the diligent efforts of a sister to contact the man of the home was rewarded by seeing him demonstrate even greater zeal for the truth than the woman. And, in another, making the effort to call even on a husband who was opposed yielded fine results.—Pages 131, 78, 79.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes the Bible study is started with the husband, but not the wife. In this case perhaps the publisher, if married, can take his wife along to become acquainted with the man’s wife. Also, the Bible student can be encouraged to speak to his marriage mate and other relatives too, explaining to them about the good things being learned. This speaking of the truth by persons being studied with has had marvelous effects in spreading the good news.—See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The.. Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">April 15, 1969, p. 254; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font10">March 8, 1969, p. 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is also beneficial to include the children of the household in</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">the Bible study. On occasions just a suggestion to that effect to the parents will encourage them to have their children sit in. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1961 Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> page 271, relates an example of the fine results from doing this. Visitors, too, who may not even be members of the family, can be invited to share in Bible studies you are conducting. In one instance when this invitation was extended, the result was a dozen more persons studying the Bible! </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(1968 Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> p. 231) Jehovah God is certain to bless our ministry as we continue to present the good news to everyone that we can possibly reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Love, a Very Important Factor”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■When a congregation in Pennsylvania reached a 50-percent Increase in six months, jumping from 59 to 89 publishers, we asked them to tell us what caused the growth. We think you will be interested in the answer. It read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“1. All unbelieving husbands of sisters were assisted; 13 are now coming to the Kingdom Hall, five are publishers at this writing, three are now baptized and two will be baptized soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“2. All publishers starting studies try to include the entire family from the first study on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“3. All publishers invite their Bible students to the Kingdom Hall at the first Study conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“4. Bus trips to the factory and Bethel made quite an impression on the whole congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“5. All physically sick are visited promptly, cards are sent and they are called on the phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“6. Any spiritually sick ones are visited by the servants as soon as this is detected by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“7. The servants try to put into use the points suggested at the Kingdom Ministry School and through the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> each month. We feel that the brothers want to do the right thing and will when shown how. We give the credit to Jehovah for blessing the congregation with love, a very important factor.” Is there something here that can be applied in your congregation?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question Sox</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ How can all of us help the congregation keep accurate records of territory coverage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When any of us take out a territory assignment, we should accept the responsibility of making a reasonable effort to contact persons at every home before returning it. Keeping an accurate record of interested ones and not-at-homes is essential if this is to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our goal is to cover all the territory at least </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">every four months.</span><span class="font9"> So if anyone who holds a territory realizes that he is not going to be able to complete it within four months, he might seek the assistance of other publishers or of his book study servant to complete it within that time period. Then, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">as soon as the territory has been completely worked once,</span><span class="font9"> it should be checked in with the magazine-territory servant and he will make note of the work that has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When taking out a territory, you are free to request any that is available. But we suggest that you ask the magazine-territory servant which ones are most urgently in need of attention and consider whether you could care for one of them. Also, check with him to find out whether the territory was last worked with magazines or with the campaign offer so that you can give it the attention it most needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then, when the territory is checked in, it would be good for the magazineterritory servant or his assistant to interview the publisher briefly. He needs to know with what offer the territory was worked. Also, if there are any changes in the territory (new streets, housing developments, demolition, etc.), he would appreciate having this information. In this way the territory records can be used most effectively to care for the congregation's assignment.</span></p>

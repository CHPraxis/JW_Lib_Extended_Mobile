<p><span class="font10">Have you looked at the service report for March as yet? It shows a tiue new peak in publishers—21,079 over last year's average! How encouraging to see this fruitage from your efforts to help others grow in faith! What will April bring? Here at Bethel we already see evidence that it will be an outstanding month of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On April 1, for the Memorial, 40,9013 were present at the 1S7 congregations in New York city. That is up 9 percent over last year. Total partakers dropped from 249 to 243. Memorial attendance in Toronto, we have been told, went up about 8 percent, to 7,971, with 82 partakers. Did you have many newly interested ones at the meeting with you that night too? Have they kept on attending?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Something else tells us that April is going to be an outstanding service month. You have been ordering a lot of magazines. Our printing in Brooklyn, even higher than last October, reached 18,474,190 copies in March. You are keeping us busy, and we are glad that you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German branch too reports a huge production: 6,413,550 magazines were printed there in March, and that is nearly triple its monthly average of last year. All together, in the United States and the ten other printing branches, March saw-over 32,000,000 magazines come off the Society’s presses around the world. What a crowd of people can be reached with the good news through their pages!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We just checked to see how the subscription campaign is coming along, and the results are good. From January through March, 465,299 new subscriptions were obtained. Just 1,318 behind the same period last year, but renewals are far ahead; so many more people are subscribing again. While giving good attention to subscriptions, during those same months you also placed over a million bound books—nearly two and a half times the report for the same months last year. Just</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book is a great aid to us as we endeavor to keep faith growing by God’s Word among interested ones in our territory, isn’t it? One publisher commented on ‘'its clear and direct approach to people.” Another said: “I can’t hide my enthusiasm. It’s a wonderful study aid!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- Most of us have now had experience in offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book in the house-to-house work and have found ways to make the offer appealing in a simple presentation. Feel free to present it’in the manner you find most effective. Help the householder to see that he needs to read the information presented.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many publishers just open the book to the picture on page four and state: “As God-fearing people we are all interested in everlasting life. We would like to live under such fine conditions as are pictured here, wouldn’t we? [Permit answer.] This is what God has promised for obedient mankind. [Head scripture below picture.] But </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font10"> will this be possible and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">what is required</span><span class="font10"> .of us? You can read the answers to these questions. This book -will show you where in your Bible the answers are recorded. It is yours for only 25c.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers feature chapter titles. They say: “We have called because so many are asking the question, ‘Why has God permitted wickedness until our day?’ (Page 65) Likely you have wondered too.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">think of it! Now we need to call back to encourage these people to read what they have and, if possible, we would like to study with them, wouldn’t we? Let’s give them all the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Convention time is getting elose. We feel it here. Do you? Will you be in attendance on the very first day? You’ll be glad if you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We remember you in our prayers, Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bsookuyn Buanch Office </span><span class="font10">The Bible answers that question and this book will show you where in your Bible the scriptures are . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You may wish to feature the title “Why We Grow Old and Die” (page 27), “Where Are the Dead?” (page 34), “The Last Days . . (page 94), “How to Pray and Be Heard by God” (page 151), “Building a Sappy Family Life” (page 170) or others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If you would like to use a Scriptural presentation before offering the book, you may find Psalm 37:10, 11 very appropriate. You may, of course, use any other appropriate Scripture text you wish.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Reports indicate that you are trying to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book to everyone and are enjoying good results. One couple crossing the country on the bus sat and talked with different people during the trip and placed fifty </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth,</span><span class="font10"> books in three days. A brother who eats out a lot has been offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book to waitresses and found the majority very happy to receive it. .Many brothers keep the book, handy at their place of employment; others keep them conveniently located at home to offer to callers. Do your relatives and friends each have a copy?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">~ Just reading the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book has aided many sincere ones to gain faith in God's Word. A Catholic lady read the book and then told the sister who called: “When you first came I doubted whether you were teaching the truth or whether my church was, but now I know,” She left the church, is attending meetings and studying. An interested woman in California had been ‘on the fence’ for months. After reading the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book she promptly stopped attending mass and began attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall on her own. An interested man in Ohio took three days off from work to read the book. Then he told our</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">7 min: Introduction, welcome. Family group or couple consider text and personal convention arrangements, the city they plan to attend, sending in room request forms, volunteering to help with the assembly, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Plan Now to Attend the International Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: Give talk (8 or 9 minutes) including high points from articles “Assemblies Are for Children Too!” and “Why Not Make It Your First Assembly?” in the February 15 and March 15 issues of “The Watchtower.” Encourage the brothers to begin to . finalize their plans now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Audience participation: Ask audience for high points or other points that impressed them in the article entitled “Have You. Invited Your Marriage Mate?” in the May 1, 1969, ! issue of “The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Starting New Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (3 min.) During September last year, we were offering “Truth” books in our territory. The report shows we placed 747,141 books that month, 823,976 in November and 630,094 in December. (Can use local figures too.) How many people who obtained a copy are we now studying with? Have you called back at least once on each “Truth” book placement to let the householder know he can have a free home Bible study and to offer to demonstrate it for him, as suggested on page four of the December “Kingdom Ministry”? If not, then this would be a good work for May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstration: (3 min.) Back-call on &quot;Truth” book placement: Householder remembers book, read some, but it was some time ago. Publisher tells householder that w’e offer a free home Bible study program. It is a 24-hour course, one hour or more a week for six months, and the only requirement is that the householder prepare ahead of time. Publisher hands householder study folder, draws attention to questions that will be answered, and asks if he can step in for a few minutes to demonstrate. Householder expresses appreciation and invites publisher in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (2 min.) Encourage similar follow-up on all subscription placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When you cover the territory are you leaving a Bible study folder at each home whether the people are interested in our literature or not? Why not make it a personal and group goal in the congregation to see to it that one of these folders is left at each home in your territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstration: (3 min.) Householder declines magazine offer. Publisher hands householder Bible study folder and says: ‘We would like you to know that we provide free home Bible studies for individuals and families in this neighborhood.’ Direct householder to a point or two in folder and offer to demonstrate study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstration: (2 min.) Mother and daughter call at home where no one is in. Youth leaves handbill. Mother hands her study folder to leave also, explaining why we want everyone in our territory to know of Bible study offer and why she has put her name and phone number neatly on folder. Daughter slips it under door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (2 min.) Encourage publishers to offer study on initial call also. Explain how this can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Social Events Need Christian Moderation.” Upbuilding talk on high points of article in May 1, 1969, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding announcements. Remind publishers of our desire to make disciples and to be on the watch for interested ones while sharing in all features of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage family studies. One parent writes: “I started all five of my children in the ‘Truth’ book the week after the assembly. They have all responded so well; we always go over our hour. It has really kindled their Interest.” Song 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING MAY 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Use Dedicated Time Wisely. Song 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Introduction, text, comments. By questions and answers consider “Do You Remember?” in May 1. 1969, issue of “The Watchtower.” This will be a good test of memory and study habits of congregation. Encourage regular reading of “The Watehtower.” 12 min: Answering Common Objections. Choose ahead of time objections commonly met in territory. Possibly, “I have my own religion,” “I’m busy,” “I’m not interested,” etc. Include, “Oh, I can’t study today.” (See &quot;Presenting the Good News.”) Ask audience how they handle these. Consider one at a time as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Have You Studied with Them for Six Months?” Questions and answers. Encourage brothers to have students read article entitled &quot;Have You Been Studying for Six Months?” in May 15, 1969, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Concluding comments. Encourage publishers to witness to relatives, friends and neighbors and try to study with them. See March “Kingdom Ministry,” page three, “Whom Can You Help?” If available, include local experiences about helping interested ones progress. Consider “Question Box.” Song 68.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING MAY 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Arrange locally to cover congregation's needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage vacation pioneering this summer. Also prepare congregation for field service activity Sunday, offering &quot;New World Translation” and a booklet for $1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Ask audience for expressions on why householders in local territory need a copy of “New World Translation,” even though they may already have a copy of the Bible. Comment also on valuable features of “New World Translation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstrate presentation and Bible study offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Presentation could be given from the ‘concordance,’ or “Important Bible Words for Quick Reference,” as outlined in November 1968 “Kingdom Ministry,” page two. Or sermon could feature Proverbs 4:5, 7: “Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.” Emphasize the need to understand the Bible when reading it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Questions from Readers. Consider as many of the following as time will allow. Call on audience to see how much of the answer they remember. Thereafter chairman or selected ones in audience may give short comment highlighting the answer appearing in “The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How is it possible for one to grieve the holy spirit, since it is not a person? (“Watchtower,” 7/1/68, page 415) In view of what is recorded at Matthew ^:44, is it wrong to pray for Armageddon to come? (“Watchtower,” 8/1/68, page 479) Is it proper for a Christian who is engaged to be married to break off that engagement? (“Watchtower,” 10/1/68, page 606) What is the attitude of Jehovah’s witnesses toward the use of tobacco? (&quot;Watchtower,” 2/15/69, page 126) 12 min: Concluding comments. Song 24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The report shows a grand new peak in number of proclaimers of the good news! 344,767 publishers and pioneers shared in the field service during March. This truly is reason for rejoicing, because it means more prais-ers of our loving Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is also fine to see the zeal reflected in the amount of time devoted to the field service. The 5,330,140 hours reported during March is nearly half a million more than for the preceding March. Keep up the good work!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Have You Studied with Them for Six Months?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> For many of us the answer is Yes. Many of us placed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> books with interested people in September and got studies started in October of last year. May will be the eighth month we are studying with them. Others have been studying in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book longer. Will we continue to study with these people or not? And why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some of you have not completed the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book with your students. What will you do? First, analyze. Why have you not completed the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book? Is it due to lack of appreciation on the part of the student? Has he frequently missed studies? Does he fail to prepare his lesson? If so, the fact that the book has not been completed is not a sound reason for spending more than six months with such a person who lacks appreciation. It might be better to go to chapter fourteen, if this has not yet been studied; study it together and then terminate the study if the householder is not taking any positive action to associate regularly with the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps you feel you should continue the study you are conducting, although six months have passed. If so, what is the basis for your decision? Has the student begun to associate with the local congregation in a meaningful way? Or has he only come to the Kingdom Hall a few times out of curiosity, while continuing to attend one of the churches of Babylon the Great on a fairly regular basis? Has the householder demonstrated that he is</span></p>

Or does the householder, while knowing that the doctrines of the churches are unscriptural, continue to show preference for attending their meetings instead of attending those of the congregation? What changes are taking place in his life? If positive action is not being taken by the householder, it is likely that the study should not be continued.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you are planning to discontinue a particular study, it might be well to spend one or two study periods with the student having a heart-to-heart discussion about the things that have been learned and their significance and the urgency of the times, rather than going ahead with a regular study of additional material. In a kind way let the householder know that the decision is one that he has to make. But there is an urgency about our work and we have a responsibility before God to use our time to aid persons who truly want to serve him. If the householder is such a person and shows it by actions, then we will continue to offer help. If not, then we feel under obligation to spend our time calling on other individuals and giving them the same opportunity to become acquainted with the Bible and make a decision that for them too can mean life.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> A special pioneer completed a study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book with a woman in January. Although this special pioneer had very few studjes, she clearly outlined to the woman why she would not be continuing the Study, How delighted the pioneer was to receive a phone call from the student later in the week, informing her that she had sent in her church resignation and she would be at the Kingdom Hall on Sunday. She was there and now the study is being continued. What a happy outcome!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In other cases, although the six months have ended, there is no question about the course we are going to follow. These people are coming to the Kingdom Hall. They are regularly associating and making progress. We will, of course, continue to study with them and help them progress on to maturity.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We appreciate the urgency of the work we are doing. When individuals show by their actions that they want to do Jehovah’s will, we will continue to aid them. Where substantial progress is not seen, then, rather than continuing the study, we do well to spend that time each week trying to find and help Someone who is sincerely interested in doing something about the truth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Studies Regularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’■Many Bible study servants have observed that a large number of studies are conducted irregularly. Can this pattern be changed? It is likely that in many cases it can be. As Kingdom publishers, you appreciate the urgency of the times and you put forth considerable effort to be on hand for the study, don't you? How often is it, though, that students forget their appointments or get busy with something else? Sometimes sickness is a problem. But how can it be handled if the student has forgotten or is inclined to let something else interfere?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One publisher says: “Well, since we are here perhaps we could just take fifteen minutes and cover a paragraph or two.” In the majority of eases householders have agreed. In fact, when fifteen minutes have passed and the publisher comments that the time is up and the study can be concluded if the householder wishes, the householder often changes his mind and suggests that the study continue. Even if the study is concluded after an abbreviated session, the interested one has been benefited by getting some spiritual feeding and he is further impressed with the importance of regular study.</span></p></li>

The husband of one of our sisters, who previously had little interest in religion, took the book to read during his noon hour and then began staying up late at night reading it because he found it so impressive. Many interested persons have been-placing the book with others—like the man in Ohio who obtained the book from a brother in his shop and in the following two weeks placed nine </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> books and two Bibles with his friends.</span></p></li>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">• How can we help those planning to be baptized this summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many publishers are now having home Bible studies with individuals who are regularly attending the congregation meetings and sharing in the field ministry. These earnest students of the Bible have left Babylon the Great and are leading upright, moral lives in harmony with the Scriptures. With many the matter of dedication and baptism has come up, and it is necessary for them to take these important steps in order to have Jehovah's approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage individuals who are seriously considering dedication and baptism to be diligent to finish a study or a careful reading of the books &quot;Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and ''Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God.” Let them know also of the procedure the organization follows in having the overseer review portions of the book &quot;Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot” with prospective baptismal candidates. The overseer should see to it that these candidates for baptism obtain a copy from the literature servant so that they can review the information to be covered and acquaint themselves with what the Scriptures have to say. This also allows the student to speak with the one with whom he studies if some matters are not clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those planning to be baptized should make this known to the overseer. The overseer or another mature brother whom he may appoint will need to arrange for convenient and ample time to review the information on pages 7-40 of the &quot;Lamp&quot; book with baptismal candidates. (Usually 3 or more sessions.) The overseer will conduct at least one of the sessions himself. Many overseers will desire to conduct all of them. The overseer should be sure that the candidate understands the basic Bible teachings outlined, is qualified to make an acceptable dedication and be baptized and that he has made up his mind unconditionally to serve Jehovah faithfully. This is a weighty responsibility resting on the shoulders of the overseer. So, serious and prayerful thought and assistance need to be given to each one wanting to be baptized. Now is the time to assist individuals to prepare themselves if they are planning to get baptized this summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In April we began to use the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot’’ </span><span class="font10">in the Theocratic Ministry School as a basis for instruction talks.

<p><span class="font10">However, it should be kept in mind that the book itself is made available only to those who have made known to the congregation overseer that they have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God anti want to be baptized. It is not meant for distribution to newly interested Bible students or even to- those who may report as publishers but are not yet taking definite steps to. prepare for Christian baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nevertheless, it is a fine thing for all to be present at the School so that they can personally benefit from the talks that are given.</span></p>

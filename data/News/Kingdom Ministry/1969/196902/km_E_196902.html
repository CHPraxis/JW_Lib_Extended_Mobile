<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>tyeait</span><span class="font15"> ^PubMe/tS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">On January 1, the day following his return from a twenty-one-day trip to the Caribbean and South America, Brother Knorr shared with the Bethel family soine interesting details of the trip. We are sure you will all enjoy hearing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Building and expansion were thrilling facets of his report: A new branch office recently completed in Antigua; plans for a new Kingdom Hall, literature depot and shipping department in Guadeloupe; branch office and missionary home just built in Barbados, with new Kingdom Hall under construction ; a new branch office planned for Trinidad; a new Kingdom Hall and missionary home projected for Belem, Brazil ; new branch office and Kingdom Hall dedicated in SSo Paulo, Brazil. Isn’t it thrilling to see all these evidences of Jehovah’s favor upon the urgent work of spreading the “good news”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Meetings along the route certainly filled up Brother Knorr's days and even nights. He stayed with the missionaries while in Antigua, and spoke to 281 brothers there. In Guadeloupe and Barbados he had outdoor meetings. There were gatherings in Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, he found the brothers assembled for a convention kickoff meeting, 10,151 of them. He had excellent audiences in Uruguay, Argentina and Chile. In Mexico City 10,540 enjoyed his remarks. Altogether, in thirteen different locations, Brother Knorr spoke to 33,282 brothers and other interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Other sidelights of the trip included : sitting up all night at Trinidad’s airport; a brief stopover at Belem, Brazil, where he talked to the missionaries from 12:30 a.m. until the time came to leave at 5:30 a.m.; addressing two two-hour meetings in one evening in Buenos Aires; and an all-night flight from Santiago, Chile, to Mexico City. Specially satisfying to the president were the opportunities to see and talk with so many zealous missionaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Many More Will Be Thankful</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Just wanted to say </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">thank you </span><span class="font11">for all the hard work you do for us so as to make our ministry easier for us. I am so thankful someone galled at my door,” writes one who is now a Kingdom publisher. Yes, all of us are so thankful someone came to our door or did incidental witnessing and so whetted our spiritual appetite, then placed literature, made return visits, conducted a Bible study, encouraged us to attend meetings and, as we progressed, aided us to serve Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In addition to being thankful that we have the truth, we are thankful for the grand privilege of aiding others to become thankful praisers of Jehovah. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines have aided us and will help many more. A sister writes: “I did not know Jehovah’s witnesses nor did I know their magazines existed. My husband and I were separated and had no plans of going back together.” But she read the magazines, learned the truth, and is back with her husband. “Through these magazines my life was reset so that it might be in harmony with Jehovah’s will,” she said. Through subscriptions that we obtain, many more will be helped to “reset” their affairs to please God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Suggestions that will help us to fulfill our heartfelt desire to aid others are appreciated by all of us, aren’t they? By letter a pioneer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The Kingdom work in all those areas is moving ahead rapidly. Brother Knorr reported. And isn’t all this expansion of the Kingdom interests very heartening to us, as we push on in our assignments, despite low temperatures, freezing rains, icy streets or snow-clogged roads? We do, though, have a grand work to do—sharing with others the comfort we have gained from the Scriptures. Its very nature impels us to keep on doing zealously what we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our warm love to you all, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">explains that she improved her subscription report by having a positive attitude, always offering both subscriptions and calling back on all promises. From subscription promises alone she obtained 19 and started 7 new studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A suggestion on the weather: February is not only a very cold month in most parts of the country, but it can be very disagreeable. This does not stop the mailman from his important work, nor will it stop our more important, activity. In fact, adverse weather can be helpful to us! How so? Writes a district servant : “In bad weather we usually find more people at home,” and he goes on to relate that during a morning of bad weather, the group contacted many interested persons, some of whom were seldom at home in better weather.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A suggestion on how to cope with the weather: While we cannot change the weather, we can dress warmly, ask the householder if we may step in for a few minutes where advisable, and work apartments and business territory if available; also, among other things, it is an excellent time to make return calls to start home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>e</sup> A suggestion to aid divided households; Is an effort being made to assist unbelieving mates? An overseer writes: “The new </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book is helping many new ones come to the organization. In our unit there are. three husbands that have shown little interest up till now. Since each has been studying the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book, it is remarkable to see the changed attitude; they all come to the Kingdom Hall, and, of course, their wives are very happy with the prospect of having them in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Many of us have now been studying the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book with interested persons for some months. Continue to encourage them to meet regularly at the Kingdom Hall- where they can share in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font11"> 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">18 min: Subscription Expirations and Bible Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) (Talk) Over one million subscription expiration slips sent to congregations in this country in last twelve months. Think of potential for new subscriptions and for Bible studies. Encourage all to make prompt calls and “preach” in harmony with Romans 10:14. (See “Lamp” book, page 130.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Servant gives expiration slips to publisher who has never made such calls. He sees importance of them, would appreciate suggestions and assistance. Servant makes suggestions: Contact one whose name is on slip, give regular sermon if possible, etc., ending, ‘I note that your subscription has expired and I woul.d be pleased to renew it for you.’ In addition to getting subscription (counted as new subscription), our desire is to start a study.

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Fine Results from Gift Subscriptions. (Talk) Review “Gift Subscriptions” in February 1967 “Kingdom Ministry.” This provision has resulted in many being able to “put faith in him.” (Rom, 10:14) Publisher wrote she had tried to speak the truth to fleshly relatives for years, but none had really listened. She sent a ‘gift subscription.’ She reports, “My fleshly sister has become interested from the Watchtower’ gift subscription.” A person who received a gift subscription wrote the Society: “I have received your letter telling me that ---- paid for the subscription. I like the magazine very much and am</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">grateful. I have started to study the Bible with ---.” Another wrote: “I</span></p>

In this country (last service year) about 14,000 became inactive. Check removed Publisher’s Record cards to make a list of all who at one time associated, regardless of how long ago. Request all to inform overseer or assistant of inactive ones they know of who moved into the territory but never associated. To assist them to regain spirituality, Bible study is vital. Demonstrate how tactful call can be made on one not associating to get him to talk and thus learn why he is inactive. (See “Watchtower,” March 1, 1967, pages 150-153; April 1, 1967, pages 201-204.) Cover need to select material in “Truth” book to fit person's immediate need. Chapter 17 has fine material on prayer, Chapter 20 on building a happy family, Chapters 21 and 22 on carrying out dedication vow’s and making true worship a way of life, etc. Overseer will arrange for publishers and servants to call on inactive ones with the goal of starting a Bible study in “Truth” book. Time spent helping inactive ones is reported as field service. (“Lamp” book, page 104, 106). Within weeks or sooner some may start attending meetings, and eventually share in service. Last year over 14,100 were reactivated. It may be that thousands now inactive can be aided to be regaining spirituality by Memorial time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Matt. 15:8, 9: “Hello, I’m [name]. It is quite common these days to read newspaper reports to the effect that religion is losing its influence. You know, there was a time when almost everyone listened to a priest, rabbi or minister when he spoke, but that does not seem to be true today. People often ask, Why? What do you think? [Wait for comment, then proceed.] Jesus pinpointed another reason here at Matthew 15:8, 9. [Read] If we truly want to worship in the way God approves, we need to know the Bible well and bring our lives into harmony with it.” (Direct their attention to the literature.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Luke 6:46-49: Same as first two sentences of above introduction. Then go on: “In fact, many people are very disturbed to see clergymen involved in political demonstrations and the like. What do you think needs to be done to make religion more meaningful? [Allow comment] Perhaps you remember the parable that Jesus stated as recorded at Luke 6:46-49. [Read appropriate parts, placing emphasis on obedience.] So if we want to have our worship approved by God, we need to listen to the things stated by his Son and then do them. And, really, of what value is religion if it does not draw us closer to God and result in our having his approval?” (Offer literature)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN DECEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Although there was much illness during the month, Jehovah’s people were busy in his service. A total of 333,354 publishers arranged their affairs to get out in the field service. As you know, these are people who have other responsibilities in life too. Most of them are workingmen, housewives or students in school. They need time for personal study of the Bible, and they attend congregation meetings. But they also saw the importance of setting aside time to snare in the public preaching of the Kingdom, and they did fine work. All together, 4,754,893 hours were devoted to the preaching of the “good news,” and 630,094 bound books were placed —more than double the number placed the previous December. There were also 2,296,782 back-calls made. Furthermore, during December a fine new peak of 12,648 pioneers was reached, and 6,706 were vacation pioneers. The report shows fine appreciation for the privilege that we have of serving Jehovan in this “time of the end.” Doesn’t it make your heart glad to know that you had a part in it?</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>We Wanted to Write a Letter to You</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">Dear Friend,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In this critical time of crime, violence and unbelief, it is indeed encouraging to us to find people like you who sincerely want to serve God. You have set aside time to study the Bible and to learn about Jehovah God and his requirements for everlasting life. This is commendable. And it is this that moves us to write this letter to you.—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You may have felt that your effort at Bible study was so small that no one really cared too much about it one way or another. But that is not the case. Your effort has not gone unnoticed either in heaven or on earth. Jesus Christ spoke about two sparrows being sold for a coin of small value. “Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge,” he said. “You are worth more than many sparrows.” And about those reaching out to serve Jehovah, the apostle Peter said: ‘God cares for you.’ (Matt. 10: 29-31; 1 Pet. 5:7) God is actually looking for people like you who want to serve him with spirit and truth.—John 4:23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So when such a person is found, what do you think is the reaction in heaven? In Jesus’ illustrations of the “lost sheep” and the “lost coin,” he tells us that there is joy and rejoicing in heaven. “I tell you,” said Jesus, “joy arises among the angels of God” when a person turns from his worldly ways to serve the living God.—Luke 15:4-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Even Jehovah God himself rejoices 'because of the interest we take in serving him. Ever since the time of Abel, God has, in effect, said to his servants upon earth: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me.” (Prov. 27:11; see also Ephesians 5:15-17.) What a thrill it is to think that Jehovah takes note of our efforts to learn of him and to serve him and is pleased when we do his will! Knowing this to be the case, you should continue with your study and seek ways in which you can be of greater service to your loving Creator, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let Us by Love Grow Up in All Things”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No doubt you have learned much during your study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Such studies have affected the lives of millions of people for the better. The knowledge you have been gaining may have caused you to wonder, “What am I going to do with my life?” If you have thought this way, then a good thing has happened to you. You want to do something worth while with your life and not waste it as so many people in the world are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“But what can I do that would make my life more pleasing to God?” you may ask. Under inspiration the apostle Paul urged: “Let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ,” which means you must continue to grow spiritually.—Eph. 4: 15, 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Spiritual growth is similar to physical growth. And what parent does not want his child to grow? It would be disappointing if a child did not grow after birth. Growth is expected. That is, why doctors and parents check regularly the growth of a child. Spiritual growth, too, should be expected. That is why we individually should want to check ourselves regularly to see if we are making spiritual progress, that is, growing spiritually. How can we best do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps a simple review will show you how much you have learned spiritually since you have begun your regular Bible study. It may be that now you can name some books of the Bible, which perhaps you could not do before. Bible names may no longer sound strange to you. You may know now how to locate the books of the Bible without too much difficulty and in much less time than it used to take when you first started to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before you started to study, you may not have known that God’s name is Jehovah, or of God’s promise of a new system of things in which man will live forever without the fear of death, crime or disease. But now you know these things, don’t you? (Ps. 83:18; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:4) In fact, you may find it relatively easy to give answers to fundamental Bible questions during your study. All of this is evidence of spiritual growth. So you may rightly ask yourself, “Where do I go from here? What else can I do so that I can ‘by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Not Forsaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Gathering of Ourselves Together”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Frankly, a person would not ask questions such as these if he did not seriously feel that he ought to do more. Happily, there are things we can and should do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No doubt the one with whom you have studied the Bible has invited you to the congregation meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. You may, in fact, have attended some of them already. That is fine. And it is very important that you continue to attend. But whether you personally have gone to the meetings or not, you may wonder: “Why is it so important for me to attend such Christian meetings?” The Bible answers in these words: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together,</span><span class="font12"> as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) That “day” of God’s judgment and of blessing his faithful people is indeed drawing very near. All around us today we have evidence of this. (Luke 21:28) So, here the Bible instructs that we not fail to gather together, and “all the more so” as we see that day of God’s vindication drawing near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From what we have already studied in the Bible, we are aware that it is wise to conform ourselves to God’s will, otherwise, we will not gain the prize of everlasting life. (John 3:16; Rom. 12:1, 2) God’s will is that we assemble together to incite others to love and fine works. And if we do not assemble together as He instructs, are we faithfully discharging his will? These are some points that you should seriously be considering now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We, as Jehovah’s witnesses, want you to make your own decision in this matter. However, since you are studying the Bible with us, and since we are encouraging you to greater spirituality, we feel sure that you would like to know about our meetings and what goes on at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If after attending our meetings you see that Jehovah’s witnesses are God’s people, you will want to assemble with us regularly as God urges in his Word the Bible. At the meetings you likely will be impressed with the fact that we are a people who truly do study the Bible and believe it to be the Word of God. As a result, we feel that you will be moved to declare, as did people in the apostle Paul’s day, that “God is really among you.” (1 Cor. 14:25) The privilege to find this out for yourself is what we want to extend to you by inviting you to our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your coming to our meetings does not mean that you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses. However, we feel that you owe it to yourself as a student of the Bible to observe firsthand what we do at our meetings, so that you can “make sure of all things;'hold fast to what is fine,” as the apostle Paul told the Thessalonian Christians to do. (1 Thess. 5:21). We want you to know that you are welcome to assemble with us. Your taking this step will be an evidence of your willingness' to grow to Christian maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So that you might be motivated to take this step, permit us briefly to tell you about our meetings. They are arranged to fill the spiritual need of the individual Christian. Generally there is something for persons of all ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Public Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have a meeting specifically arranged for the public; in fact, it is called the public meeting. This usually takes the form of a discourse. But speakers may on occasions use pictures, maps or an outline of points on a blackboard. As part of the program, arrangements may be made for questions both to and from the audience. At times, the material may be presented by a symposium of speakers. A wide variety of subjects come under consideration at this meeting. There are talks about marital problems and the difficult situations that confront youths in this modem world. Christian morals are discussed. The marvels of creation and scientific confirmation of the Scriptures are considered. Films produced by the Watch Tower Society may also be presented from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These meetings are patterned after those conducted by Jesus Christ, his apostles and their associates. Often the early Christians spoke in public halls. Paul used a school auditorium in Ephesus as a place to give talks. (John 18:20; Acts 17:1-3; 19:8, 9) Not only the public, but the disciples were very much encouraged by the things that they learned from these discourses. We feel that that will be your experience too as you regularly attend the public meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “Watchtower” Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The meeting that usually follows the public meeting is called the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study because, at this meeting we study the Bible with the aid of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine. At this meeting, which is an hour in length, you will see persons perhaps very much like yourself who, a year or so ago, were just beginning to study the Bible. At the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study you will see many of these same people making voluntary public declaration of their faith. They will answer questions on material that frequently deals with the application of Bible principles to their daily living and fortifies them against the “spirit of the world” and unchristian conduct.— 1 Cor. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Through the columns of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">comes increased understanding on Bible doctrine and the fulfillment of prophecy. Regularly sharing in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study will enable you to keep in focus Jehovah’s righteous new system of things. It will assist you to manifest the fruitage of God’s spirit. (Gal. 5:22, 23) In your life it will keep strong your desire to serve Jehovah zealously. It will fortify you for the trials of faith that lie ahead of us. It will help you to prove worthy of perfect life under God’s everlasting kingdom of righteousness. And is not this what we need and want?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Right now you may be saying to yourself, “I could never learn to make a comment in a meeting.” But with the spirit of God’s Word at work in us, this is possible. The apostle Paul said: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (Phil. 4:13) Eighty-year-old Moses, who said to God, “Excuse me, Jehovah, but I am not a fluent speaker,” later spoke to rulers and gave a long lecture on the plains of Moab. (Ex. 4:10) This illustrates how much help Jehovah can give a person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps even now you may have been moved to want to talk to others about the things you have learned from God’s Word, but you did not know quite what to say or how to say it. Well, our weekly Theocratic Ministry School is specially designed to help persons like you. We recognize that there are few people today who are trained to speak what they hold dear in their hearts and minds. Our Theocratic Ministry School offers continuous training for men, women and children of all ages, free of charge. Enrolled in the school are young children, teen-agers, fathers and mothers, even grandfathers and grandmothers. Such family participation in a school makes learning a real delight. Here you can be taught to speak more effectively and to make a fine presentation of things pertaining to Christian faith. Such training can aid you to become an effective praiser of Jehovah, as well as to give fine comments in the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Service Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Quite frequently the things we learn from the study of God’s Word move us to want to tell these truths to others. The prophet Jeremiah on one occasion said that the word of God “proved to be like a burning fire” shut up in his bones; and he got ‘tired of holding in, and he was unable to endure it.’ (Jer. 20:9) He had to tell it out. We may sometimes feel that way too. Our service meeting is designed to help us in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Featured at the weekly service meeting are talks that highlight Scriptural methods to use in the Christian ministry. The apostles had various ways to carry on the preaching work, which they passed on to fellow Christians. The apostle Paul stated: “That is why I am sending Timothy to you, as he is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord; and he will put you in mind of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus, just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.” (1 Cor. 4:17) So today various methods are used to get the Kingdom message into the hands of the people. To encourage ministers to greater service, stimulating experiences had both locally and in other parts of the world are related. There are demonstrations designed to show effective ways to introduce the Kingdom message to people and to increase their interest in God’s Word, also to show how to cope with various obstacles and objections. This meeting aids us to serve God more effectively, which is something we want to do as Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Congregation Book Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Also in your very neighborhood, most likely, there is a meeting called the congregation book study. A number of your neighbors come together regularly each week for an hour Bible study, with one of Jehovah’s witnesses acting as a chairman. Since the study is generally held in a private home, there is an informal air about it, even though it is an organized study. People feel free to speak up. Here, at present, we are discussing material from the Bible book of Revelation. In a small group personal attention is capably given and spiritual growth is quickly manifest, to the delight of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So if you have asked yourself, “What can I do to bring myself more in line with God’s will?” the answer is plainly set before you: ‘You should not forsake gathering together’ with others who seek to serve God in harmony with his Word. Attending these meetings is one thing you can and should do. We thought you would appreciate our mentioning this, along with our giving you a brief description of each meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Ponder over These Things”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You have taken the first step, and what a fine step it is—your studying God’s Word! Assembling together with God’s people is the next step you should want to take. It is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a very</span><span class="font12"> rewarding step indeed. By meeting together you will come in closer touch with God’s organization, which is His instrument to help you during these critical times. (Isa. 32:1, 2; 2 Tim. 3:1-5, 13-17) Problems will arise and God’s overseers at these meetings stand ready to help you. This is an additional reason why you should want to assemble regularly with God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God says that his people belong together in one fold. (Mic. 2:12; John 10:16) Since you have manifested interest in God’s Word, we feel sure that you will enjoy meeting with us. It seems only reasonable that you will want to prove to yourself whether we truly are the people who worship God in full harmony with his Word. We strongly urge you, therefore, to find out by assembling with us, by observing our conduct and ministry. We ask you to put us to the test. We believe that once you prove to yourself that ‘God is really among us,’ you will want to assemble with us regularly. ‘Not forsaking the gathering together’ to study God’s Word is God’s will for all of us, and our doing so is an evidence of spiritual growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We, therefore, say to you what the apostle Paul told the young Bible student Timothy: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Special Privilege of Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During last April, 18,342 found that vacation pioneering is a joyful privilege of service, as has been so with thousands over the years. Will you be able to serve in March or April of 1969?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp&quot;</span><span class="font11"> book, page 200, speaks of this as a “special service that is within the reach of nearly every Christian minister.” Page 199 shows that the requirements are not difficult and can be met by dedicated ones of all ages. To be a vacation pioneer an applicant should be able to give a witness by himself, answer reasonable questions, be situated to meet the goal of hours and have a sense of responsibility that accompanies an appointment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Ton may wonder, “How often during a year may I serve?” As often as possible. Some serve one, two or more months, either consecutively or periodically, with the goal of 100 hours a month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If you cannot serve for a full month, with the goal of 100 hours, perhaps you can set aside two weeks, with the goal of 75 hours for the month. During the two-week period the goal is 50 hours, with an additional 25 hours during the other two weeks. This is not designed to reduce the goal of 100 hours a month for the pioneer service. Hence, the two-week appointment is not made for more than one month at a time, nor extended for consecutive months. It is a special provision to accommodate those who have only a limited time available, such as when on vacation, etc. Why not try it this April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If, during your appointment, you find that you can continue, we will</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ In many places February 12 and 22 are worldly holidays. Congregations may want to arrange field service accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It is suggested that congregation committees review the June 1968 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> “Question Box” when recommending pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ if the circuit servant is with your congregation during the week of Memorial, the usual Tuesday-evening meetings will be held Wednesday evening. Only the Memorial is to be held Tuesday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It will assist the Society greatly if overseers will order vacation pioneer applications and other forms when submitting the regular literature order for the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and the April 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will be special issues. Please order extra magazines that will be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Vacation pioneering in April: It may be desirable for the overseer to arrange a meeting soon at a time convenient for those interested in vacation pioneering in April. Many arrangements can be worked out among themselves and with the overseer re-</span><span class="font11">be pleased to extend it. Some make such requests known on the bottom of their report card. All extensions of any current appointment are for one or more full months and for the goal of 100 hours each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Are there goals other than hours? If appointed for one or two months, with the goal of 100 hours a month, we suggest the goal of 100 magazines each month. If serving for several consecutive months, with the goal of 100 hours a month, endeavor to reach tiie goals of 35 back-calls and 7 Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> What If one finds, after having been appointed, that he is not able to meet the goal of hours? If you are appointed for only two weeks or one mdnth, do the best you can and send your report in as usual. If you are appointed for several months, it is best to inform the Society, requesting removal until a more favorable time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Is it necessary to serve as a vacation pioneer before applying for regular pioneer service? Many do so, and it is most beneficial. However, it is not necessary if one meets the pre-enrollment requirements, is recommended by the committee and is able to meet the goals. If one does serve for some months as a vacation pioneer during the six months preceding the requested starting date on the regular pioneer application, the ability to meet pioneer goals is also considered by the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Have you thought about this special privilege of service? We encourage you to do so and, If possible, to enjoy the vacation pioneer service this March or April and as often as you can. Your joys will be many.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">garding group witnessing, etc. Applications should be sent in 30 days ahead of time, but those finding later they can serve may send applications anytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Congregation servants and pioneers: It will help us considerably if all pioneer reports are sent no later than the third day of the month and if the pioneer’s name (as listed with the Society) and address appear legibly. ♦ Circuit servants: In your introductory tglk on Saturday night, we suggest that you use points in the December 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article “The Joy of Abounding in Accurate Knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Both the March 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and the March 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will invite the readers of these magazines to the Memorial. But, of course, these notices do not give your Kingdom Hall address or the time of your meeting. Why not order enough Memorial invitations so that you can leave one each time you place one of these magazines? When ordering Memorial invitations, please be sure to use a separate handbill order form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(a^uestion. t$ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• May one’s imitating of extreme styles of clothing and grooming lead to restricting or withholding of service privileges?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes. The Bible shows that those enjoying privileges as servants—and the same principles apply to pioneers —should be exemplary in conduct, &quot;moderate in habits” and &quot;free from accusation.&quot; Old and young are exhorted to be &quot;sound in mind” and “reverent in behavior” so the Word of God &quot;may not be spoken of abusively.” Christian women are admonished to “adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.”—1 Tim. 3:2, 10; 2:9, 10; Titus 2:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All faithful Christians know that cleanness, neatness and moderateness reflect favorably on the message they bear. Hence, they manifest reasonableness if they dress in harmony with what they profess to be: ministers of God. Would these want to detract from the spotless reputation of Jehovah by imitating extreme styles of clothing or grooming of hair that characterizes rebellious elements of society? To the contrary, they should dress moderately and inconspicuously so their appearance does not call special attention to themselves instead of the good news they preach, accentuating sex or embarrassing others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of the above, it can be appreciated that those imitating worldlings in extreme styles of clothing and grooming do not manifest the Christian maturity required for special service privileges. While what one wears and one’s grooming are personal matters, the organization must determine, in harmony with Bible principles, who will represent it as servants, on the platform and as pioneers. The congregation committee has the responsibility to handle these matters and, when necessary, inform the Society. Of course, the committee should maintain a balanced view, guided by the moderate position of the Bible, rather than by personal tastes or austere standards. They should also be aware of what is considered respectable dress and grooming in the community. Not being quick to act, they will give loving counsel on why certain reasonable changes are recommended, or why restrictions might be made for the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Servants and pioneers especially should be brothers and sisters who fit the moderate Bible standards, having reputations that are not merely tolerable, but exemplary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Fine Provision</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The insert that is part of this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> can be used to help someone who is now studying the Bible with you. After the material has been discussed on the service meeting, we suggest that you give your copy to the one with whom you are conducting a home Bible study, and discuss it with him to stimulate his appreciation for the meetings. If you are not conducting a study at present, then why not turn your copy over to the Bible study servant after the material has been discussed, so that he can give it to a publisher or a pioneer who has more than one Bible study?</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_196902_files/km_E_196902-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:284pt;height:47pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Six Months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A publisher recently wrote about the fine progress her student is making in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book and stated that they will complete the book within six months, as she put it, “a little ahead of schedule.” Are yotir studies also making good progress? Would you like to know what some are doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- One publisher, on initially offering to start a study, kindly and tactfully explains that she will be happy to conduct a study for six months if the householder is willing to accept one responsibility. What? Prepare each lesson so as to benefit/ fully from the material. It has worked well for her. Why not try it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Another publisher starts her study each week by asking the householder her understanding of the subject. This enables 'her to know the points in the lesson on which to concentrate and which can quickly be covered. A brother says that he considers all the material under a full subheading before reading the paragraphs, in this way emphasizing the main ideas instead of many details. The questions are used as a basis for discussion and key scriptures are read, but the discussion is quite conversational and as a result the householder’s comments give a good indication</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them Enjoy Meetings Even More</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Parents, you have a marvelous privilege, training your children in the way of life. Included in such training are meetings. Do your children enjoy them and want to attend? Likely they do. Would you like some suggestions that will help them to enjoy meetings even more?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Isn’t it true that you enjoy the meetings most when you are prepared and participate in them? Children do too. While it is good training to require tlie children to sit quietly and listen, when they are prepared to participate they benefit and enjoy meetings even more. As a family, can you all get together at home to prepare for the meetings? If so, fine. If time and circumstances do not permit you to do so for all the meetings, where there are sevof how well he really understands the subject</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Occasionally there may be a situation where you feel it advisable to spend two weeks to cover a certain chapter thoroughly, for example, with one who strongly believes in the trinity. Having cleared the matter up for the student and having gained his confidence, you will no doubt be able to cover many of the other chapters at the rate of one each week. Rather than spending a part of your study period to review last week’s lesson, you may prefer to devote the entire study period each week to the new chapter in order to complete it. In many cases it may take more than an hour to cover a chapter. As we study we get to know approximately how long it takes to cover material with the student. Knowing about how long it will take to cover the next chapter, we can inquire if the student can set aside enough time next week to complete the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In utilizing the suggestions to help us cover a chapter each week, however, we should not adopt the view that our objective is simply to cover a lot of material. We need to take enough time to help our students understand. It is also vital to build heart appreciation. This we can do and yet move along in the study if we focus principal attention on the main points.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">eral in the family, why not arrange for various ones to assist? For example, father might regularly aid his children to prepare for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, mother for the book study, and older children can assist the younger ones to prepare for participation in the Theocratic Ministry School and service meeting. Even grandparents and other relatives who want to have a part can help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Often children have enjoyable and heartwarming theocratic experiences at school as well as in the field service. Do you encourage your children to share these experiences with others in the congregation? Association with other people is always more enjoyable when one has something upbuilding to contribute</span></p>

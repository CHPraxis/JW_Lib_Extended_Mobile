<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.<sup>1</sup>’—Luke 21:28.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)eaii S-e^ou/ ^PubMe/ts;</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">When we look back on the past year, it is evident that Jehovah’s rich blessing has been on his people everywhere. Particularly were we thrilled by the news that, when the &quot;Peace on Earth” assemblies Concluded in Europe, the grand total of over 103,000 persons had been baptized world wide during the past service year. 29,730 of these were immersed in the United States. Perhaps you are one of them. If so, we rejoice with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But why did you get baptized? Because you had dedicated yourself to Jehovah; you had made a decision that you truly wanted to be Jehovah’s possession and that you wanted to do his will forever, isn’t that so? You made this decision because you had learned the truth from the Bible. Perhaps one of Jehovah’s witnesses placed Bible literature with you when calling from house to house. Regular home Bible studies no doubt helped, during which you actually read together from the Bible and from the Society’s publications. And attendance at congregation meetings did much to convince you that you had really found the truth. Now it is your privilege to help others in the same way, and Jehovah will bless you as you do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If at all possible, share regularly in the house-to-house work, to give everyone possible the opportunity to hear the Kingdom good news. We also encourage you to make it your goal to conduct at least one home Bilile study each week. It is not difficult, and it is one of the finest ways to help others to come to know and love Jehovah. You will probably want to start your study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book. If you can cover a chapter each week, do that. But not everyone can move along at that pace, and it is usually not wise to go so fast that you fail to read the paragraphs. Whether you discuss one paragraph at a time, or several, we suggest that you always read together all the paragraphs in the book. With some persons you will be able to cover the entire book</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Time Left Is Reduced&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Time is passing by quickly, isn’t it? Just think, each passing day draws us one day closer to the end of this wicked system of things and one day closer to the time when the peace of a thousand years will begin. How appreciative all of us are that we have come to know these things and of Jehovah’s provisions for salvation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- At one time or another, on receiving little or no favorable reception when working territory, we may be somewhat inclined to feel, ‘What’s the use? People in this territory have had many opportunities to hear the truth.’ Though people are unresponsive, we always do well to keep in mind that Jehovah is cognizant of our efforts to serve and please him, and one purpose of our witnessing activity is to please Jehovah, isn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> While, time and again, individuals may not indicate any responsiveness to the truth, that does not mean that eventually there will be no change. From Colorado this letter was received'from a person who had turned Jehovah’s witnesses away for years, but now has a Bible Study : “I write to say ‘Thank you.’ I thank Jehovah (how strange and new to write his name). Do not let the slamming doors ever discourage you, for I know there in six months; others may require longer. But, as you study, be sure to tell them about the congregation meetings and invite them to come with you. In these ways you can help them to find the same blessings that you now enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a grand privilege to serve the great Creator of the universe. It is not a difficult work. It does not require great personal ability, but it does require willingness to be used by him. Many blessings will be yours as you continue to show that willing spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Bbanch Office</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">must be others like me who are not happy serving a false god, who don't even know they are serving a false god. And, most of all, thank Jehovah God for directing your feet-to my door.” Yes, today many are changing and accepting the truth. We want to continue helping them, don’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Last October we obtained 211,706 new subscriptions. Wouldn’t, it be fine if we were able to obtain an even greater number this year so that the message of truth could go into even more homes regularly? It is suggested that publishers have as their goal the obtaining of at least one new subscription, regular pioneers five, and special pioneers eight.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> From where will most new subscriptions come? In Paul's day, he stated: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” So today, “from house to house” is the main avenue of finding interested persons.—Acts 20: 20. ‘</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Oh, yes, witnessing to relatives and friends is also a fine means of obtaining subscriptions. We don’t want to forget ones with whom we study either, do we? Too, it may be they have some friends who would like to subscribe. Why not inquire?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">' Gift, subscriptions have had very favorable results. A sister sent a gift subscription to a very busy man, the vice-president of an electronics firm tor which she worked. In appreciation he wrote: “I would like to express my appreciation for your thoughtfulness in placing me on the subscription list I have already received a couple of issues and found them very interesting.” The publisher states: “I hesitated for a long time in sending him magazines since he was such a busy man and had so much reading to keep up with. Thank you for en-</span></p>

A teacher has a prepared .course and must' know exactly what he wants conveyed to the minds and hearts of those in his group when the study is completed.

Pioneers on the list before July 1, 1969, may receive a free </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font9">by making request of their literature servant. This will be included in the congregation order, and, later, credit may be requested for the pioneer’s copy.

No study questions are yet available, but the Society will prepare them and you will be notified when they maybe ordered. If, for some reason, you do not have the printed study questions by December 1, your book study servant may make up fitting questions for use. If you complete the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Babylon”</span><span class="font9"> book before December, then use the remaining weeks to review it, or you may study together some </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">material that is particularly appropriate to the needs of your group. </span><span class="font10">in mind for present and future use. Make it a goal to give comments with the least amount of help from the book, looking up as much as possible while commenting. Talk about points at other times during the week so as to get, not only knowledge, but also understanding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The conclusion can be very helpful if properly handled. Again, do not always ask, “What did we learn tonight?” or give a synopsis.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Calling back on persons with whom we place special issues, those whose names are on explred-sub-scription slips and those who promise to subscribe when you call back will also result in many new subscriptions. And any who desire to do so may offer subscriptions for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> for $2, leaving six free booklets.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> The October 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> on “Law and Order” and the October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> with the subject &quot;The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years,” are very timely issues, aren’t they? Are there&quot; people anywhere that are not interested in these subjects? It is suggested that each congregation arrange for someone to call at the police headquarters and all law-enforcement agencies, as well as visiting judges, lawyers, etc., with the special issues. A brothei' in Illinois who called at the police station writes: &quot;We found the Chief of Police in his office, along with two other officers. The result—15 minutes spent in discussing problems of today, four books and six magazines placed. A back-call was arranged for at the home of one of the officers.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> In addition to sharing in magazine activity and offering two magazines if the subscription offer is not taken, many of us during this special month may be able to call at a few homes each week on our way to the congregation book study and other meetings. Whether walking or driving, if we start a little early, we will have opportunity to work some homes or to talk to people on the street. If each of us placed two additional magazines a week this way, it would mean about 700,000 more magazines each week!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> October &quot;will go by quickly as we keep busy in Jehovah’s joyful service. At the end of the month we will be thirty-one days closer to the end of this wicked system of things I While there is yet time, let us do all we can!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Further illustrating the practical value of the folder, another publisher writes: “I called on a iiouse where no one was at home. I left the folder &quot;Would You Like to Understand the Bible?' Returning at a later date, I called on this house again and the lady invited me in. She asked if I was the one that had left the folder. I explained the purpose of our visit and showed her the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book. She didn't take it but she asked for a subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> After a few more calls a Bible study was started.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The above experiences are only a few of many received at the Society’s office pointing out how magazine work, not only provides people with good news that they can read concerning the Kingdom, but can open the door for Bible studies. While we would like to make October the finest month of magazine activity to date and the greatest subscription month to date, let’s also be Bible-study conscious, fully appreciating that this is a most effective means of aiding others to learn the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">® If the material studied is a commentary-style discussion, verse by verse, such as in. the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon” </span><span class="font10">book, a fine method of review is this: Ask all to close their books and open their Bibles to the verses covered in the discussion, for example, Revelation 17:15-18 (covered on pages 599-603 of the book). Then let various ones comment on each verse. This reminds all that they are actually learning what is In the Bible, so that they can go right through the verses explaining them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do They Know?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A publisher from Florida writes: “I looked forward to an interesting day of magazine activity. That morning we covered one block and placed many magazines. At one home the man accepted the magazines and stated he always read them. We called back several times and both the man and his wife were receptive and every call seemed to be more interesting. A Bible study was started and they thoroughly enjoyed the refreshing waters of truth. After several studies Larry said that, if he bad known about our Bible study arrangement, he would have asked for one much earlier. He had thought our work consisted of just placing magazines. This forcefully brought to my mind the admonition to call on all with whom we place literature and offer the opportunity for a Bible study.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Is there some way we can let those we meet on magazine day know of our desire to help them understand the Bible? Yes, there is. The Bible-study folder outlines our Bible-study program very well and many fine studies have been started by those who have been using it in magazine work. Why not put the folder to work for you by leaving one with each set of magazines placed? Some have obtained good results by taking a few </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">books with them in magazine activity and being alert to place these along with the current magazines whenever the householder shows more than the usual interest. Once the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book is in his hands it is not difficult to consider briefly the folder with him and start a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers have found it helpful to put their name, address and phone number on the folder. A letter from Washington states; “During Saturday morning field service I placed a. set of magazines with a young gentleman. On the following Monday I received a phone call from him. He said this folder told him he could understand the Bible and he wanted to know how. So I arranged to call back with a brother that very evening.” A Bible study was started and is progressing nicely. Instead of putting their own name and address on the folder when working in certain types of</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">• What factors should receive consideration in dividing: existing: congregations to form new ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many factors must be considered, such as the size of the Kingdom Hall and of the congregation, number of brothers qualified to be servants, travel distance, financial obligations, and other matters pertinent to local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The suggested minimum number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font9"> publishers for a new unit is 75, and preferably 80, which is a good number for starting a congregation. Generally with that number of publishers there are sufficient qualified brothers to handle servant responsibilities and meeting parts, financial obligations, etc. If a division is made prematurely, the increased load of responsibility on a few can be discouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Where Kingdom Halls are small and crowded before reaching approximately 160 regular publishers, some committees have asked what can be done. Perhaps more suitable facilities can be rented or a congregation-owned hall enlarged. If there seems to be no practical solution and there are sufficient qualified brothers, and no financial problems, the committee or the circuit servant may recommend a division to the Society, stating the facts. In some cases it may be that a new congregation can be formed by taking some publishers from one or more adjacent congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Where travel distance is great or there is a lack of transportation, there may be advantages to forming a new congregation even though there will not be 75 or 80 regular publishers in each. Here again, the circumstances may be taken up with the Society. (See &quot;Lamp&quot; book, pages 152-156, and January 1963 &quot;Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">We. here at Bethel had another grand month producing foreign-language publications. We made well over two million books in January, in fact. But we are looking ahead! For now we are keenly anticipating the public talk to be given throughout the country on March 30. What a title! “Why Almighty God Laughs at the Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What we all want to do now is talk to the interested people at our Bible studies and encourage them to be sure to hear that talk. Also, we can invite them to the Memorial celebration. Yes, let’s talk it up each week so they will be sure to get to these meetings, the public lecture on Sunday, March 30, and the Memorial on Tuesday evening, April 1, after 6 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There must be a million studies going on around the world now. And when one stops to think how all of Jehovah’s witnesses are encouraging these people to come to that public talk and to the Memorial, why we certainly should expect and prepare for a great crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another thing we should try to do is to help and encourage those persons who qualify to share in the field service. Maybe between now and the time for the conventions this summer, or perhaps at the conventions themselves, a good many of these will have made a dedication to serve Jehovah and will be ready for baptism. We really need to help all we can to escape from Babylon the Great and make it to God’s organization. And now is the time for action, for the big assembly is only four months away. We surely want to have them with us at that grand international gathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Oh yes, and for those of you who will be traveling abroad this summer, we should mention that the Greek assembly has been transferred from Rome to Nuremburg. It will be on the same dates, but in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are still many sheeplike persons to be located in our territories, in all sorts of unlikely places.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Answering the Challenge</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Often we face challenges, don’t .we? In fact, continually we are brought face to face with issues that test our integrity and our love. But with Jehovah’s help we can successfully meet all challenges. (Phil. 4:13) During March there is a special challenge to be met in connection with our ministry. We are now in the third month of our subscription campaign, and we want to be as effective as possible in obtaining subscriptions and aiding interested ones to learn the truth. Perhaps some of the following suggestions will help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One district servant said, “Think double subscriptions.” People are used to receiving both of our magazines, so why not offer subscriptions for both? Many publishers are very successful in obtaining double subscriptions because they “think double subscriptions.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A circuit servant commented, “It is really an impressive sight for many to see </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in a number of languages. It’s also effective , to show the persons we meet at the door a copy in their own language if other than English.” Some brothers have obtained a few magazines in languages that are prevalent in their area and displayed these when they meet individuals who speak these languages. “This has served to impress many with the scope of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> And persons of foreign-language background who normally say they do not want the magazines in their own language find it difficult to say No when they actually see the magazine in their own language.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">What can we do about them? Let’s answer the challenge by diligently, painstakingly covering the field, sounding out the Kingdom message in every place. What happiness to be used in bringing them into the safety of Jehovah’s organization I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Br.00Kr.YN </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Branch Ofitce</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The same circuit servant observed that business people are often overlooked. Yet in business territory he averaged about six subscriptions for each hour by saying: “I’m one of Jehovah’s witnesses and I find that I am at a real disadvantage in seeking to talk to business and professional men because they are either seldom at home or very busy. Yet I feel an urgency to share my personal convictions with you. I know you are very busy but may I at least suggest'that I send these printed' sermons (display </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!)</span><span class="font11"> to you through the mall to take the place of our talking together.” He then tells them the cost. Instead of filling out the forms, if the storekeeper is busy he merely asks for his business card and tells him that he will receive the magazines in thfe mail in a few weeks. That sounds effective, doesn’t it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If you find .someone who already subscribes for one of the magazines, inquire if he has the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. Is he aware of the six-month study program? It may be- that in this manner a number of studies can be started with interested ones. Surely this will help us to meet the challenge of the ministry successfully. '</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">SPECIAL TALK, MARCH 30</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> What a thought-provoking subject we have on that occasion—■ “Why Almighty God Laughs at the Nations”! We encourage all of you to advertise this public talk widely. Naturally we should invite every interested person with whom we are studying the Bible. Overseers will want to anticipate transportation problems or other obstacles and make arrangements for overcoming such. Book study servants should be well aware of any in their group who need help to get to this talk. Those of us who conduct , Bible studies will certainly want to build</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING MARCH 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Putting Kingdom Interests First. (Matt. 6:33) Song 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk by Bible study servant with appropriate demonstration of use of material in March 15 “Watchtower” article “Why Not Make It Your First Assembly?” Start talking about it with newly interested ones now. 20 min: “Answering the Challenge.” Questions and answers. On para-■ graphs 6-8 have book study servant demonstrate arrangements he is making to help all associated with his group, including newly interested persons, get to the special talk and Memorial. Approaches publisher conducting a study and offers practical suggestions. To facilitate this, the Bible study servant might supply names of those with whom we are studying and publishers conducting the studies to book study servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Branch Letter. Family group engages in a lively discussion of letter and Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">2 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: Concluding comments. Consider “How to Use the Insert,” and briefly discuss its contents. Offer suggestions on how best to use it. April with its special activity is close at hand. Invite all who can to vacation pioneer. Apply now! Song 92.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING MARCH 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: “Make Sure of the More Important Things ... Be Filled with Righteous Fruit.” (Phil. 1:9-11) Song 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments..'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Enthusiastic talk on March 1 “Watchtower” article “Over 10,000 More Responded for Full-Time Service!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Demonstration. A Full Day of Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Several publishers talk as if discussing some past service meeting part on “A Full Day of Service.” One always observed happiness of pioneers because sharing in service full time; wishes he could do same, but unable because of heavy family responsibilities. Another suggests that, while' they may not be able to do it every day, they might occasionally arrange affairs to spend a whole day in service just like pioneers. Publisher comments: “You know, those suggestions were so reasonable I just can’t help thinking about them. Why, I can almost hear the chairman putting the challenge to the congregation ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(11 min.) (Chairman breaks in at this point.) Would you like to increase your service to Jehovah? Are you able to pioneer? Would you like to vacation pioneer? Many are and receive a blessing. However, if you cannot, perhaps you can arrange, at times, to spend a full day in the service. This would enable you to increase your sacrifice of praise. (Heb. 13:15) For example, wouldn’t you like to take a whole day just to make the not-at-homes and back-calls that sometimes accumulate and perhaps start a new study? Many could easily keep busy for a day working on these calls alone, to say nothing of regular house-to-house work and caring for present Bible studies. Think how satisfying it would be to care for these things, and what a blessing to the people in</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">the territory as well! (Acts 13:48, 52) This month why not take a portion of that day to invite people to the special talk and the Memorial? Perhaps you could utilize the time off from your secular work that may be granted by your employer at various times. You can take a Saturday, Sunday or, if a shift worker, some convenient time during the week. Set aside four to six hours just like the pioneers do when they go out. Even older ones and shut-ins can arrange for a full day of service by inviting interested ones to come to see them during the day. Yes. almost all can share. Ask audience now many would like to try a full day of service. Encourage these to get together with others or even talk to some of the vacation or regular pioneers and make arrangements to go out with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) At this point the two publishers resume conversation. “Those were good suggestions all right. What a fine show of enthusiasm there was when the brothers were asked how many would like to try it.” “Yes, the congregation is really enthusiastic. It certainly makes one feel good to know that one is doing everything he can in Jehovah’s service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Inviting New Ones to Share with Us in the Service. Talk, with demonstration, showing the need to invite ones with whom we study and who are attending meetings to share in service. Demonstrate with two persons after study is over. They prepare sermon together. Discuss importance of reliance on Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Remind brothers to start studies in “Truth” book where persons have obtained subscriptions. Progress to date on subscription campaign. Song 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING MARCH 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: “Let Anyone Thirsting Come.” (Rev. 22:17) Song 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Introduction, text and comments including family discussion of Question Box material, which mature family head uses to show proper attitude toward any who start to associate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Demonstration. Building on What They Already Know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman: Our house-to-house ministry is indeed a challenge. People are so preoccupied today that if our introduction does not appeal to them or immediately catch their interest our presentation may be terminated at that point. However, if we can successfully draw persons into conversation, it is generally a simple matter to complete our discussions. One practical way of doing this is to find out what a householder already knows about the Bible or subject we are discussing and then try to bring something additional to light to stimulate his interest. For example, the theme of our current sermon is “Religion That God Approves.” After introducing ourselves we might ask the householder . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Publisher at door asks: “Do you feel the Bible can help us determine which religion is approved by God?” Householder says he does and publisher tactfully inquires why he feels that way, using any further questions necessary to get householder’s view and ascertain where his thinking may not be in harmony with truth or where knowledge ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1 min.) Chairman: Publisher is now</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">in a position to effectively help him grow in knowledge by building on what he already know’s. It is a simple matter to make transition to Bible or appropriate point in “Watchtower” article. However, in some territories people will not respond favorably to a brief, carefully worded question. They may not grasp immediately just what you are really getting at. You may get a better response by opening with short, simple questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) Publisher at door asks a number of simple questions to which householder answers affirmatively. “Do you have a Bible in your home? Do you believe that God is its author? Can it help you to find the right religion?” Publisher then proceeds as outlined above. Another publisher, receiving a “No” answer initially, asks tactfully why householder feels that way and then tries to find some point of agreement to build from. Individual agrees that if the Bible is God’s Word it will tell how he wants to be worshiped, and the publisher cites an example of this at Matthew 15:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman; With advance preparation this method can be used with any sermon. Tact and discernment will help us to get on a friendly basis with the householder from the start of the presentation. Give thought to making sermons appealing and interesting. (Eccl. 12:10) By building on what they already know we will be able to meet the challenge successfully and gain a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Presenting the Good News with a Sense of Urgency. Question-and-answer discussion. Have brothers tell appropriate experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Taking New Ones with Us in the Field Service. Chairman discusses importance of helping new one understand methods of ministry. Demonstrate with two going from door to door. Show how to keep House-to-House Record and its value. Talk about different ones they meet and various approaches to appeal to them. At end of service, arrange to go out again. 10 min: Concluding comments. Build enthusiasm for special talk and Memorial. Encourage special effort to help every interested person throughout territory to be in attendance. Comment on slogan on page 8. Song 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING MARCH 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Giving a Witness Worthy of the Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) Song 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk by enthusiastic brother on theme for month. (See April 1, 1969, “Watchtower.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: &quot;Coping with the Problems.” Overseer discusses problems with book study servants and definite arrangements are made to put suggestions into effect in congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: The Joy of Aiding New Ones to Share in the Field Service. Discussion of joys in helping new ones taste serving God. Can receive many blessings. (yb68 142-143) Do not hold back from inviting those who qualify. (yb69 215-216; yb67 154) Use local experiences too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Concluding comments. Overseer urges all to report field activity by first weekend. Encourage all to spend ‘a full day in service’ at least once in April if possible. Review appropriate highlights of entire “Kingdom Ministry,” encouraging all to apply suggestions. Song 103.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>YOU ARE INVITED TO HAVE A SHARE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Dear Friend:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You have been in our thoughts a great deal since we wrote you last month. We hope that you are continuing to advance nicely in your study of God’s Word. What a wonderful thing it is to acquire accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s will during these turbulent times! And you are doing more than that, because you recognize the wisdom and value of the apostle Paul’s words at Hebrews 10:24, 25. Thus you are among those “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together . . . and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The step you have taken in beginning to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses is a cause for happiness in a number of ways. Have you thought about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First, it makes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font0"> rejoice to see that you place the proper evaluation on spiritual things. The very fact that you are taking in accurate knowledge of God’s will is a demonstration of your faith, and we truly are delighted to note that. Next, your course is most pleasing to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font0"> Our heavenly Father cares for you and is happy to see your spiritual progress. He inspired the statement, “My son, if your heart has become wise, my heart will rejoice, even mine.” (Prov. 23:15) Finally, what about you yourself? Just think of the peace of mind and happiness </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font0"> now have, compared to just a few months ago. So the course you have been following truly is worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah blesses us in so many ways and he is so kind to us, isn’t he? It is good for us to reflect on what we can do to thank him for all of his goodness. Is there anything that we can give to him? The psalmist said that God owns the animals on a thousand hills; everything really belongs to him already. (Ps. 50:10) Does that mean we can do nothing? No, we can offer him a “sacrifice of praise.” Hebrews 13:15 speaks of this as “the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No doubt your love for God has increased as you have drawn closer to him, and it is only natural to want to express that love. Quite likely you have already found yourself talking with others about the wonderful things you have been learning. Hence, you already may have been offering a limited public “sacrifice of praise.” That is fine! All of Jehovah’s witnesses had the same experience when they first learned the truth of God’s Word. Talking about our heavenly Father comes as a natural expression of one’s love for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You have learned that this old system of things is soon to pass away, to be replaced by a new order inhabited by those serving Jehovah. If you knew of an impending disaster such as a flood, you surely would notify those right around you so that they could take steps to be preserved. Similarly, people need to be warned of the approach of Armageddon and helped to learn the way to safety. What a privilege it is to share with others this message and the knowledge that under God’s kingdom they can enjoy everlasting life free from dreaded sickness and even from the fear of death itself!—Rev. 21:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHOM CAN YOU HELP?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we do something, we like to do it as effectively as possible, and you probably feel this way about sharing with others the good news you have been learning. Just where can you apply your efforts, and how, so as to do the most good?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You very likely are in a better position than anyone else to aid a particular group of people. We are thinking of your friends and relatives. They already know you and so might receive the message of salvation more readily from you than from a stranger. But how should you talk to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Usually it is not wise to try to tell one’s relatives and friends everything at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Share one or two good points at a time. Remember that they may not yet have the spiritual appetite and desire for understanding that you have. (Heb. 5:12-14) So do not assume that they will embrace the truths about God’s kingdom the very first time you speak with them. They may show a lack of interest or some prejudices that you will have to overcome slowly. Tactfully present Scriptural truths so as not to antagonize, not telling them bluntly that they are in error. In this way you will be dealing with them .in love, which is the way you appreciate having people deal with you.—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Would you like other practical suggestions? Why not select some published material that you could leave with them to stimulate their desire for additional knowledge? One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Pennsylvania knew that his relative was interested in ancient history. Consequently, he provided the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font0"> and directed attention to the material on ancient history and archaeology; That opened the door, so to speak, and over a period of time the Witness was able to help his relative become a true worshiper also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are studying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</span><span class="font0"> you may have noted a chapter that you feel would be of interest to some friend or relative. You may obtain extra copies of the book at the literature counter at the Kingdom Hall and use them in witnessing to your relatives. Or there may have been a particular article in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> that you think one of your acquaintances would enjoy reading. If, because of what you know of the person, you feel it would be best not to start off with Biblical material, possibly one of the articles in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> on some general topic will be of interest to a relative. After you leave the magazine with him he may read other articles and thus become more interested in the Bible message. You may also get additional copies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> at the Kingdom Hall for use in this way. And do not forget that if you need help in answering some question that comes up, or you would like suggestions as to how to proceed, you will not be left on your own. The one with whom you are studying the Bible will be happy to assist you, as will other Witnesses at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A final point we might mention in this regard is the importance of keeping in mind that not all to whom you speak will be interested. If your tactful message is not favorably received at first, try to leave your relatives in the best frame of mind possible. In that way you will have other opportunities to speak with them, and perhaps you can then approach matters from a different standpoint and will receive a welcome response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few may even be quite opposed to your growing interest in the .truth of God’s Word and your sharing it with others. But that likely will not surprise you, having read in the Scriptures that some persons would react that way. (Matt. 10:36, 37) Simply be determined to endure such while relying on God for the support that he is happy to give you. (Ps. 55:22; 1 Pet. 5:10) Being thus fortified by Jehovah, you can continue to seek out those who, like yourself, are happy to respond to the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPING STILL OTHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps you wonder about the many others who are not your acquaintances or relatives. How will they be helped? Not everyone would be reached with the “good news” if we talked just to those whom we know personally. We are interested in helping everyone, in preaching the “good news” in the entire inhabited earth. (Matt. 24:14) For that reason, each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses has a certain area assigned to it, and arrangements are made to call on every home to talk to those who live there. You may have heard announcements made at the Kingdom Hall about occasions during the week and on weekends when those in the congregation share in the public house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This method of spreading the good things of God’s Word is not new. In fact, Jesus encouraged it by sending his disciples from place to place to carry on the public ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(Matt. 10:11-14) After the Christian congregation was established the early Christians followed this method. We read: “From house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ.”—Acts 5:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But even though you do have an earnest desire to speak about God and to help others, you may feel somewhat apprehensive about going from door to door talking to strangers about the Bible. We understand how you might feel. Really, most of us felt the same way at one time. But we got started, and now we truly enjoy it. The arrangements made in the congregation for group witnessing are especially fine for new ones such as yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Usually a new one sharing in spreading the truth goes along with an experienced minister, possibly the Witness who has studied the Bible with him. This allows for training, and then as the new one becomes more at ease, he can take a larger and larger share in the witnessing. You will find this arrangement to be upbuilding, for working along with others affords opportunity for assistance and an interchange of encouragement.—Rom. 15:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prior to sharing in this feature of the witnessing work we suggest that you discuss the matter with the Witness who studies the Bible with you. He will be glad to provide more details as to just what is done and why. He can also offer some ideas as to what to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During March and April many of the Witnesses will be talking to people about “Religion That God Approves,” and some suggestions on this topic are outlined on page 2 of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> for February 1969. It is not difficult. You might use a simple presentation such as: “Hello, my name is [Name]. I stopped by today because, as you are probably aware, religion seems to be losing its influence. Unlike in the past, people do not seem to be interested in what religious leaders have to say. Haven’t you noticed that? [Wait for brief reply.] A comment Jesus made about the teachings of religious leaders in his day helps us understand why religion is losing its influence today. Note this in Matthew 15:8, 9. [Read] An important step in being sure that we believe the commandments of God and not of men is learning more about the Bible. This publication has aided me to do so ... [Offer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Practice it a few times, making any adjustments you want to fit your own way of expressing yourself. This will make your activity most effective because you will have in mind something definite to say. Sometimes the presentation is even briefer, highlighting a beneficial article in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> Yet, as we mentioned, you can obtain kind assistance from an experienced minister and so you will be well prepared before you begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us emphasize, though, that the preaching work is effectively carried out by Jehovah’s witnesses not because of natural ability or a special aptitude for speaking with others. Practice and training do help, but the vital thing for happiness and success in the ministry is God's spirit. We must rely on it. Jesus knew that situations might arise in the public ministry where his followers would need assistance. Encouragingly he promised: “The holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you ought to say.” (Luke 12: 11, 12) Stop and think! No one in the universe is more able and powerful than Jehovah. Consequently, if one relies upon the help Jehovah provides through this spirit, he can share in the public ministry with confidence and success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WILL THE RESPONSE BE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You may wonder just how people will respond as you speak to them in the house-to-house ministry. Jesus said that the responses to the Kingdom message would vary, some persons being interested and others not. (Luke 10:1, 2, 8-11) This was illustrated in the ministry of the apostles. Those to whom they preached who were “rightly disposed for everlasting life” rejoiced when they heard God’s Word explained and they “became believers.” What a joy it is to help such ones! But others “went on hardening themselves and not believing” what the apostles taught. (Acts 13:48; 19:9) Frankly, you will probably find that the majority of the people you contact will simply be apathetic. You will have the challenge of trying to stir up their interest in God’s Word by the good things you can tell them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">QUALIFYING FOR SHARING IN THE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Obviously to represent the Sovereign Lord of the universe is a very great honor and privilege. We can see from Psalm 15:1-5 that God has requirements for those he would approve. We already know that you believe God’s Word to be inspired. You know and accept the basic teachings of the Bible, and lately you have been associating with Jehovah’s people at the congregation meetings. —2 Tim. 3:16; 2:15; Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other Scriptural requirements for ministers of God include knowing and acting in accord with what the Bible says about honesty and sexual morality. Additionally, one would need to have heeded the Bible’s prohibition of drunkenness. (Eph. 4:25; 5:18; Heb. 13:4) Surely a Christian minister would not be part of a religious organization that was teaching false doctrines. (2 Cor. 6: 14-18) Also, being free of involvement in the political affairs of the world as well as being in harmony with the principle at Isaiah 2:4 would be necessary.—John 6:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We believe that you meet these requirements and that you want to witness about Jehovah. (Ps. 110:3) That is why we are inviting you. If, though, you know of a particular problem regarding one of the above about which you realize you need help prior to sharing in house-to-house witnessing, feel free to discuss it with the Witness who studies the Bible with you or with the overseer at the Kingdom Hall. They will be pleased to assist you to make any necessary adjustments so that you can begin to share in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The experience we are speaking about is one that we feel will bring you a tremendous amount of added joy and satisfaction. It is altogether fitting for us as creatures to talk about our God, Jehovah. Though the step of doing so from house to house will be a new one for you, it is one that has been taken by thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses. Some were quite timid at first, but they trusted in God and he did not let them down. By his spirit he has qualified and assisted his servants to perform the ministry. It certainly is not accomplished by one’s own strength. As the apostle Paul wrote: “Our being adequately qualified issues from God, who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers.” —2 Cor. 3:5, 6. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do not hesitate to speak about your plans with the person with whom you are studying the Bible and with other friends you have made at the Kingdom Hall. They will be able to offer you encouragement and will probably help you to appreciate that they had feelings similar to yours when they began in the field service. Now they are very happy that they took the step you are about to take. As you act with reliance on God we are certain your happiness will also increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is our sincere hope that these suggestions will prove helpful to you. Remember that Jehovah’s organization in heaven and on earth backs up those who serve Jehovah by proclaiming the “good news.” (Rev. 14:6, 7) We recognize, as you do, that we are deep into the “time of the end.” There is little time left for this old system of things. So we want to share together in following the Scriptural injunction at Revelation 22:17: “And the spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say: 'Come’’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">May you enjoy rich blessings as you share in the service of God. We are confident that your desire to communicate the “good news” will grow day by day as you keep on taking in knowledge and giving it out, all to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yours for answering the challenge to uphold true worship,</span></p><img src="km_E_196903_files/km_E_196903-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:39pt;">

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Coping with the Problems</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>From all over the country come reports that it is increasingly difficult to find people at home. How do you cope with this problem? Circuit servants from Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania have been encouraging the brothers to save their not-at-homes and then make these calls on Sunday or, if advisable, on some evening. What has resulted? Well, here is a report from Philadelphia, where some territory is worked about once a month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> “Three of the publishers encountered people who wanted to know why we were skipping some of the houses. When .these people were told that we called at those houses earlier in the week, they marveled at our zeal. One sister placed four books with a man who said he is rarely at home. Another sister found two different young people who had been living at their present homes for the last three years, yet this is the first time they had Witnesses call at their homes as far as they could remember. Books were placed and a study was started.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A circuit servant from New York State reported: “Last Sunday afternoon in my car group, while it was snowing and raining, in less than two hours of calling at not-at-homes, we placed eight </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> books. In calling on these not-at-homes I mentioned to the householders that we called here during the week but did not find anyone home, and that we had the privilege of talking to many of their neighbors about something that concerns all of us. This arrangement worked well.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> This brings up another related problem, brothers. One circuit servant put it this way: “It seems there is quite a challenge to help the brothers to maintain the proper attitude toward Sunday afternoon service (where meetings are held in the morning). There is a tendency to use the time in other ways.” On what, then, does successfully coping with this problem depend? Leadership, mainly! If this has been a problem in your congregation and if you are an overseer reading this, why not analyze your situation? See what can be done to provide greater leadership for Sunday afternoon witnessing. Servants taking the lead will make a great difference.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If you are a publisher reading this, ask yourself how you can adjust your affairs, if at all possible, to be out some each Sunday. Perhaps you can change your eating habits, eating a sandwich at the Kingdom Hall and then going out with the group immediately. If you have obstacles to overcome; talk to your book study servant or overseer. They will be glad to be of assistance wherever possible. Of course, if you find it more advantageous to go out during the week, that is fine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Some circuit servants have been emphasizing, with good results, that if we strive for two hours on Sunday afternoon, we would be finished with our service at approximately 3 p.m.; or if we put in three hours, we would be done about 4 p.m. This still gives us considerable time for some relaxation or change of pace and getting ready for the next week’s work, and these things are important too, aren’t they?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Coping with the problems of finding people at home and providing greater leadership over the weekend are two big things that still need attention.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">In reviewing the report for January it is evident that Jehovah God has richly blessed our combined efforts. The entire report is very encouraging and it is especially good to see the &quot;Watchtower” campaign get off to such a fine start with 145,891 new subscriptions obtained. Such an excellent beginning shows that the future prospects are certainly bright. Another encouraging part of the report was the number of home Bible studies that were conductd in January. We reached an all-time peak of 313,848! It shows that you brothers certainly have love in your hearts for persons who are seeking to learn about our God Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">MEMORIAL, APRIL 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ This, of course, Is the big event of the year. Why do we always look for such a splendid turnout on this occasion? It Is the one celebration that Jesus commanded his followers to keep each year. Then too, consider its strengthening and unifying effect upon the whole organization. Also this year speakers will have </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> fine new outline for the Memorial talk. All of us in the audience will benefit from the material. Every effort should be put forth to build up anticipation for this occasion. If persons are attending the Memorial for the first time, it would be good to stress to them the importance of attending the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and the public meeting each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">®Also the March 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">invites its readers to the Memorial and the March 22 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">will carry a full-page notice of the Memorial celebration. Likely this will stir up questions in the minds of some interested ones as to where and when the Memorial will be held. Therefore, we recommend that you put your local Memorial invitations in the magazines you place during the weeks prior to April 1. In this way Interested ones will be directed to the right location for this - allimportant event. May Jehovah prosper us as we answer the challenge of the ministry during March.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With a Sense of Urgency</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The time remaining in which to reach millions of persons is reduced. With Jehovah’s help we will be able to meet this challenge successfully. Haven’t you found the fine suggestions made at the recent circuit assemblies on Saturday evening most beneficial?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One of the suggestions was centered around the thought 'of encouraging them to do some reading and studying of the truth in addition to the regular study that they have each week. We want to stimulate in them a desire to know Jehovah and his ways, don’t we? Do they have a real hunger and thirst for truth and righteousness? (Matt. 5: 6) Do they really want to avail themselves of God’s provisions to help them?—Ps. 25:4; 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A case in point occurred recently right here in Brooklyn. When the brother conducting the study came to pages 15 and 16 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book he enlarged on the information, in paragraph 11, about the Beroenns. He inquired as to whether the interested person understood just why the ancient Beroeans were referred to with approval in God’s Word. The answer, as related in Acts 17 :11, is : Because they &quot;received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">daily</span><span class="font11"> as to whether these things were so.” The publisher then went on to point out that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">daily</span><span class="font11"> reading and Studying of Jehovah’s Word also help us to make progress toward gaining God’s approval. He then presented ■ the latest </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> suggesting that this person use some time when riding the subway to and from work to do reading. At the very next study the interested man buzzed with excitement. He was very happy for the magazines, had read them thoroughly and asked for more. He said: “Look, I would really like to have these magazines regularly. Can I subscribe for them?” Naturally the brother conducting the study was happy to provide him with two subscriptions and his extra reading has helped him face opposition he is experiencing at home.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> There are so many ways in which we can stimulate additional reading. Experiences have shown that some newly interested ones will sit up late at night to finish reading one of the books. Others have taken bound volumes of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and read them straight through to gain knowledge. Please note two outstanding experiences resulting from extra reading as reported in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1969 Yearbook, </span><span class="font11">page 167. So is it possible that we can stimulate the desire, of these new ones to make faster spiritual progress through additional reading? We think so!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How to Use the Insert</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you read the insert with this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> yet? It is entitled “You Are Invited to Have a Share.” We believe you will find it very encouraging. After reading it you will observe that this information. does not apply to all who are having Bible studies conducted with them; it applies to those who are now attending meetings. If you personally do not need the insert at this time, you may want to make your copy available to a publisher who is studying with several persons who are attending meetings. This can be coordinated through the Bible study servant after the service meeting for the week of March 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We sincerely hope that some of these suggestions will prove to be beneficial to new ones who are about ready to share in the field service. As we live in the most urgent of all times we surely want to invite these new ones with whom we are studying to share with us in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps now is the time to invite the one with whom you are studying to share in house-to-house witnessing. He may be one of the new ones who will join with us in the month of April when we look for an increase in the number of praisers serving Jehovah our God. And, of course, we want to remember that if we invite this new one into the field during April we will want to help him to appreciate the necessity of doing this work regularly. This service, we can make known, is part of our worship, and regularity and dependability identify true Christians in whatever they do.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>(c^aeAtion</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">o How should we react when someone whose dress or grooming is markedly different from ours attends a meeting or assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses are well known for their modest and clean grooming. This is noted especially about our young folks who are not slaves of radical fads. And this is as it should be, for we do not want our appearance to be a cause for stumbling or to distract others from the Kingdom message.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So when someone new comes to a meeting or convention and is dressed unconventionally or according to an extreme style of the world, it is* plain to all, including that person, that he or she does not represent the Witnesses in general. If that individual truly wants to learn to be a minister of God, he or she will change in time, as did the &quot;Go-Go&quot; dancer mentioned on page 23 of &quot;Awake!&quot; of November 8, 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We welcome all types of persons to come to our public meetings, not only to hear about Christianity, but also to see it in action. Many persons have been impressed by the warm, friendly welcome they received even though they yet displayed visible evidences of the influences of the world. They found that we reflect in many ways application of the counsel against favoritism and class distinctions. (Jas. 2:1-4) In word and deed we say: &quot;Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.&quot;—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely we would not want to stare at such a new one or in some other way make him feel that he is not welcome; for if he is sincerely seeking &quot;life’s water,” he definitely, is welcome. If there is a persistent problem or disturbance, the overseer or attendant can handle it. But in general we can continue to welcome visitors with the honest warmth and friendliness of genuine Christians.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">What a grand time we have had during these past few months—conventions, new peaks in publishers and fine experiences in the ministry —all of it reflecting Jehovah’s goodness to us I It also makes evident the fact that there is plenty of work for all of us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Here at headquarters a night shift went into operation again on September 29, and it is hoped that we will be turning out over three million books a month, probably for the next three mon (Jis. It is surely a cause for happiness to know that the need for this extra work is the direct result of your zealous efforts in the ministry. Keep it up, brothers, and we shall do our best to keep you well supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Something else of special interest to all of us took place on October 1. The annual business meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was held in Pittsburgh. Brother Knorr addressed the 2,376 persons present on the appropriate topic “Go . . . Make Disciples . . . Baptizing Them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Soon December will be here and we shall be offering the new book 7s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the Bible Really the Word</span><span class="font12"> o/ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God?</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font12"> for $1.25. What a fine opportunity this will afford to reach people of many languages in our territories! Why? Because the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font12"> book is already available in thirteen languages and the complete </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> is published in four languages other than English. Have you ordered the supplies that you will need? Let’s all consider the needs of our respective territories and make a really concentrated coverage of the field during December. If you do not have enough </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font12"> books to use with the Bible then use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book with the Bible for $1.25 contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">December should prove to be a most interesting and joyful month. As the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp&quot;</span><span class="font12"> book points out, this is the time of year when &quot;everyone</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What a marvelous time in which we live I How favored we are above all other people to know Jehovah, to understand his purpose and to be able to carry out his will! The warm, close relationship that we enjoy with our Heavenly Father prompts us to offer sacrifices of praise to him, displaying zeal in the ministry and participating to the fullest extent that our personal circumstances permit.—Heb. 13: 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For over a year now as we have been sharing in Jehovah’s service we have used the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book and, as we all know, we are continuing to have phenomenal success with it. By showing, not merely the title of the book, but certain chapters to persons most likely to be interested in them, many publishers have had excellent results. We suggest that you try that during November. Why not go down through the table of contents and select subjects that will appeal to certain types of people in your territory and then offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book to these individuals on that basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For example, when calling on older persons why not feature Chapter 4, &quot;Why We Grow Old and Die.” By coupling this title with the point is encouraged to give special thought to those with whom he has been studying the Bible ... to see if any of them are ready to Start out in the service, and, if they are, we want to help them.” We might start making preparations for that now. After the fine new peaks we had in April and August of this year, it will be most interesting to see what December will bring.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">So we all have plenty to do. have we not? And as we busy ourselves in Jehovah's grand work, let us do so joyfully, offering to God sacrifices that will truly be well pleasing to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">from page 109 showing that in the earthly paradise, instead of obituary columns, there may very well be announcements of newly resurrected ones, you may find that you can arouse considerable interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■» What about the many family groups in your territory? Not all of them have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book yet, do they? If you discern that you are talking to a family head or to a mother, why not refer that person to Chapter 20, “Building a Happy Family Life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Consider, too, the law-enforcement officers, educators and government officials in your territory. Might not Chapter 18, “Christian Obedience to Law,” appeal to them? Why not take the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book to these individuals during November. This short six-page presentation on law and order is powerful and moving. It may open the way for further conversations and possible Bible studies. They need the good news just as much as others do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> And what about your relatives? Do they all have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book? Have you offered it to them yet? Select the chapter that you believe wiil appeal to them most and offer it with some appropriate comments. If they don’t want it, they will let you know, but since the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book has such tremendous appeal it would be wise not to underestimate what it can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ Naturally, as we offer our sacrifices of praise to Jehovah all during November, we will want to keep in mind our objective of searching out deserving ones and helping them to learn the truth by our studying with them. (Matt. 10:11) There are many useful suggestions on starting studies in this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> May we refer you especially to the articles entitled “Help Them to Cross Over” and “Refer<sup>1 </sup>rals.” We suggest that you read these articles now and then seek to apply this information in a practical way in your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Demonstration. Use of the Bible-study folder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(4 min.) Chairman discusses following information with audience: now does the prospect of starting a study appeal to you? Does it seem like a mountainous obstacle? If it does, perhaps the Bible-study folder may be the instrument to reduce that “mountain” to a “mole hill.” In any event we believe you will find that the Bible-study folder will enable you to start studies on the initial call more successfully. You may use any approach, but many use the direct approach with good success. Eventually we ask the householder if he would like to study the Bible; oftentimes the sooner we ask the sooner we reach our goal. The folder will sometimes assist us to arrange for a Bible study on the initial call. How? By using it as an outline for speaking with the householder. Begin with the first page, which asks: “Would You Like to Understand the Bible?” This tells him our purpose in calling. Then turn to page 2 and discuss it with him. Ask which question is of particular interest to him. When he selects a particular question, he has indicated where his interest lies and this may aid you to decide which chapter in the “Truth” book to study with him. Page 3 of the folder describes our Bible-study program. It answers the questions, Where? When? Who? and What? Consider the points with him. You may want to tell him, for example, that the folder is his written guarantee that our service is completely free of charge. Explain that the study course lasts six months and we spend about one hour a week. All together, this is about a day out of a person’s life. Surely honest-hearted persons should be willing to take a day of their lives to learn about their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then turn to the chapter in the “Truth” book in which the householder has expressed interest and consider several paragraphs on the initial call, or you may start with Chapter 1. Cover enough to whet his appetite and show him exactly what we have in mind when we invite him to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(8 min.) Demonstration of foregoing method by capable publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) Chairman. This method gets results. It is so simple that a youngster can use it effectively. Try it this week. We know of two brothers who tried this method in a rather &quot;difficult” territory and each started a Bible study within the first three discussions that afternoon. It is true some will refuse our offer of a study, but, then, suppose thirty persons we contacted in a day’s service all accepted. Could we care for them? Some may feel that this approach will cut down on placements. On the contrary those who have used it have found that it increases placements. Why? Because it immediately identifies us as ministers. The householder knows ture servant should handle. May interview family if desired. Consider portions with questions and answers. Should encourage vacation pioneering during December. Many off from secular work. Might show family head discussing plans and making arrangements for family to share fully in ministry during December, with some applying for vacation pioneer service. 10 min: Talk: &quot;Do You Associate or Merely Attend?” September 15, 1969, “Watchtower,” pages 569, 570. Make application to local circumstances. 15 min: “Referrals.” Talk and demonstration of fitting points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Theocratic News, appropriate items from Announcements and concluding comments. Song 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Serving Under the Direction of “the Faithful and Discreet Slave.” (Matt. 24:45-47) Song 86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on theme for December. See “Watchtower” of December 1, 1969. Encourage optimistic view of opportunities for expansion locally in December. Aid each one to scrutinize self and opportunities to share in the work during December. Is there anyone we can personally aid to be more regular at meetings or to begin sharing good news with others this month? 20 min: Presenting the Offer for December. “New World Translation” and “Word of God” book for $1.25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During December, it is our desire to direct the attention of people to the Bible. As an introduction you may want to read a scripture that has to do with Kingdom blessings (ms, pp. 167-170) or the importance of taking m knowledge of God (John 17:3). Since material here obviously involves our eternal welfare, it is important to know whether it is true. Ask householder whether he believes that the Bible is God’s Word. If so, does he feel that he could present solid evidence that would convince others of that fact? A solid basis is needed for enduring faith. (If he does not believe it is God’s Word, you might acknowledge that a thinking person would want reliable evidence before accepting such a belief.) Then open to the Con- ' tents of the “Word of God” book. Point out some of the chapter headings; urge him to investigate. Offer the book, along with the modern-language “New World Translation,” for just $1.25. If the complete offer is not accepted, offer just the “Word of God” book for 25c. Demonstrate, using first a householder who professes to believe the Bible, and then one who does not believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discuss various points in “Word of God” book that can be brought to attention of those to whom we talk. 15 min: We Want to Help Them. Chairman emphasizes points regarding congregation increase in December. See pages 113 and 114 of the “Lamp” book. Demonstrate how one conducting study tactfully discusses field ministry with student who is progressing nicely and attending meetings. Make demonstration practical, emphasizing “how” to assist new ones who qualify to be invited in the ministry and “what” to say to get them started in the field ministry as well as how to discern whether they are ready or not. See “Qualified” book, Study 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 64.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them to Cross Over</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Honest-hearted persons everywhere are beginning to realize there is no hope in this present system. They feel that this system is apparently nearing its end, and they wonder why. Many are beginning to think that what the Bible says about the end of this system of things may be correct. They want to know the truth and so are turning to •Tehovah’s witnesses because they know we are students of Jehovah’s Word. This is one of the reasons for the unprecedented demand for our literature in every language and in every form all over the earth. Certainly, then, we want to do all we can to help these honest-hearted Individuals to make their way across the great gulf between the old system of things and the new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We all appreciate the role that Bible studies play in this, but possibly you have difficulty in starting studies. If so, have you taken the matter to Jehovah in prayer, seeking his help? Also, have you examined your methods of work to ascertain if any improvements can be made? For example, do you keep a good house-to-house record and call back on all placements? If the householder’s initial response was poor, you may feel there is no need to call back, but perhaps he will read what you left with him and respond to the Fine Shepherd’s call,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Two or One?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many publishers have commented on how easy it is to place our small books. In fact, often it is just as easy to place two of these small books as it is one. But will that accomplish the most good?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When territory is being covered several times a year, or perhaps every few months, it is good to be able to offer something new to the people on each visit, isn’t it? So, during November, when we are offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, it would be good to feature just that one book, instead of offering it in combination with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font12"> book for 50c. Then, on another occasion, feature one of the other books.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> Of course, if you meet someone who shows interest and who already has the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, offer one of the other books. Or, if some question arises and you know that one of the other books answers it, offer the one that you believe will be most helpful to the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">* But placing the book is only the first step. We need to call back to stimulate further interest. When you proving that he is of a sheeplike disposition. (John 10:27) We do not want to underestimate the power of Jehovah’s Word upon honest-hearted ones, do we? (Heb. 4:12) Therefore, when placing literature it is well to have in mind the words recorded at Ecclesiastes 11:6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Realizing that we do our work &quot;under God’s view,” when we place literature and promise to call back, we want to keep that promise. (2 Cor. 2 :17) How many persons have read the literature and, without further encouragement, started attending meetings and sharing in the field ministry? To the contrary, most persons need patient, regular assistance, and we are in a position to give that help. It is true that some who accept literature do not want a regular home Bible study, but let’s be sure that, if they are not studying, it is because that is their choice, not because we have failed to explain the provision and offer it to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> There truly is a great chasm between this old system of things and the new system. The Bible-study work can help those who earnestly seek God to get across this chasm. Appreciating the urgency of the times, let’s all ask ourselves, “Is there something more that we can do to help as many as possible to cross over while there is yet time?”</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Family Group</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> One of the most gratifying things to see is a unifled, loving, harmonious family group. Have you ever considered what makes the fine families in Jehovah’s organization what they are? If you asked any head of a successful family group, lie would undoubtedly tell you that the good results stem from applying Bible principles in the family relationship and putting the interests of the Kingdom first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">~ Regularly held and properly conducted family studies should be an integral part of family worship. This builds spiritually strong families. That parents have the primary responsibility to teach their children is clearly emphasized at Ephesians 6:1-4; Deuteronomy 6:6, 7 and Psalm 78:1-4, What family would not profit in a spiritual way from the loving oversight of a father who, with loving concern for his household, conducted his family study each week? With purposeful teaching on the part of the family head, each member of the family can be aided to grow to spiritual maturity. Following the example of the Bethel family, many families have found that Monday evening is an ideal time for family studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As for sharing in the ministry, one circuit servant suggested recently that the servants put forth a special effort during his visit to help their own children. Instead of assigning the servants to visit any publishers outside of their own families during that particular week, he suggested that each servant go home and work out an arrangement for his children to have as full a share as possible in the field service during that special week of activity. They agreed to do this, and since the children were out of school during worldly holidays then, there was considerable time available for service. Parents and children worked closely together during this week, and this was a definite stimulus to all of them. In this particular case there were 47 publishers in the congregation, and during the week of the circuit servant's visit they spent, on the average, 8.5 hours in the field, placing 11.1 magazines and a total of 116 books. This is really remarkable when you consider that the congregation usually averages only 6.8 hours a month. This circuit servant’s suggestion that family groups make room in their schedules to share in the field service together surely is a good one. You parents, why not try it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Could you improve your family’s effectiveness in presenting the good news by arranging to spend some time with each one on a regular basis, giving attention to their specific needs in the ministry? Really, this is a family head’s responsibility. May Jehovah bless you as you shoulder this richly rewarding responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">persons developed out of a small group of publishers. He added that this was the warmest, most friendly congregation he had ever seen, because the publishers were all either relatives or friends of one another even before accepting the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Another brother commented that he went a step farther, asking his Bible student to discuss the matter of a possible study with his friends and relatives and to describe the arrangement to them. Then when his student had made the arrangements. ■ all he had to do was come in and conduct the study. In this case not only did he get more Bible studies, but he also tactfully started in the witness work the individuals with whom be was already studying. Why not try this method yourself?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Did the 1970 service year get off to a good start? Indeed it did, with 357,982 publishers in the field, including a new peak of 13,687 regular pioneers. Truly Jehovah is blessing us, and how thrilling- it is to be living in these exciting times. As we continue individually to look well to the interests of the Kingdom, surely we can expect to have many rewarding experiences in the field ministry, perhaps starting a new Bible study or aiding someone to come to meetings for the first time. May we continue to walk with Jehovah each day.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question $ox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">• How can we increase our effectiveness in the field ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We might consider four basic factors. The first two we can control to a large degree because they have to do with our personal approach to the ministry. The last two deal with the householder’s attitude and require discernment on our part. These factors are: (1) Are you understandable? Is your speech simple, down-to-earth and articulate so that people understand you and thus can act on what you say? (1 Cor. 14:8, 9) (2) Are you bold, straightforward, and yet tactful? Do you really have a desire to share the truth at every possible opportunity? (Eph. 6:19, 20; 2 Tim. 2:24) &lt;3) Is the householder teachable, willing, to listen? Some householders can be rather argumentative and can tie up our time. So, discernment is called for and on occasion it might be fitting to terminate the conversation, excusing ourselves graciously, explaining that there are other people we have to call on in the area. We want to spend our time with those who will respond to the Kingdom message. (Prov. 1:5; Matt, 7:6) (4) Is the householder a lover of righteousness? If there is some question as to whether he is or not, paint a word picture of the new system, using points from Revelation 21:1-4 or Isaiah 65:17-25, and then ask the householder whether he would like to live under such conditions. He does not necessarily have to agree that he believes in the new order, but does it sound good to him? If possible, would he like to live there? If so, likely he loves righteousness, and we would not be wasting our time to assist such an individual. (Ps. 45:7) Rather, we would be making our time count.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are other factors too, but the above points are basic and many of our brothers have found them helpful.</span></p>

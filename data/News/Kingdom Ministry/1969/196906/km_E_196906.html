<p><span class="font12">These are certainly busy days for Jehovah’s servants, are they not? Here at Bethel the days are filled with ever-increasing activity. Why, in just the first eight months of this service year, from September through April, we produced 17,806,277 bound books compared to 6,561,016 in the same months last year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To take care of this tremendous increase in production, we have constantly had to expand our Bethel home to house more workers. On Friday, May 2, we enjoyed the dedication of the latest addition to the Bethel home. After a morning of regular work, we bad a special noon meal where Brother Knorr spoke. Using photographs shown over closed-circuit television to the family in our four dining rooms, he explained how the Society has increased its printing facilities and living Quarters over the years. Our factory now takes up four city blocks, and we now have 1,036 regular members of the Brooklyn Bethel family to serve you brothers !</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The dedication was on Friday. By Sunday night, just two days later, the new building was almost all occupied! By whom? By the first group of 92 circuit and district servants who had come in for a refresher course. Each week we will enjoy having a new group until all in the United States have finished the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On May 10 we had our “kickoff” meeting for rooming work at Yankee Stadium. The 13,737 attending enjoyed the fine program and many are already sharing in the search for rooms. As of that same weekend, the brothers in Atlanta, Buffalo, Kansas City, Los Angeles and Vancouver had started their rooming work also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of us at Bethel are keenly looking forward to the assembly, and we know you are too. It will be the finest spiritual feast yet So make plans to attend every day. And keep up the good work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Bbanch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT A MARVELOUS REPORT!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">357,851 public praisers of Jehovah New peaks in almost everything</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How happy it makes us to see a new upsurge in the number of those who make known the goodness of Jehovah! April saw 357,851 sharing in the field service. That is 34,163 over last year’s average, a 10.6-percent increase. And this includes a new peak of 13,157 who arranged to spend full time in the ministry as regular pioneers. It is obvious that Jehovah has richly blessed your efforts to aid others to come to know and love him. And what about those of you who have newly begun to share in the service? Already you are beginning to find contentment and happiness that you did not have before, isn’t that so? It is as the Bible says: “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” —Ps. 144:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- The month got oft to a good start as a result of two special meetings: The public talk on.“Why Almighty God Laughs at the Nations,” attended by 523,729. And the</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Most people we talk to already have a Bible, don’t they? That being the case, it may be asked, Why offer them the A'ew </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation? </span><span class="font12">Well, do you find it is easier to read and understand than other Bibles that you used previously? So will they. Also, in contrast to other translations, it gives due prominence to God’s name and, as we know, all who will gain life must come to know Jehovah and call on his name. —Rom. 10:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How can we effectively offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation?</span><span class="font12"> Why not highlight one or more of its helpful features? For example, use scriptures such as those quoted on page 52 of “Make </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sure&quot;</span><span class="font12"> to illustrate its clear Tenderings. Or, you may want to show in a practical way how the concordance can be used to find celebration of the Lord’s evening meal, for which 748,475 assembled. There were '4,561 who partook of the emblems—111 fewer than last year. And how they rejoiced to see present the great crowd of others who, by their attendance, showed appreciation for the loving provision for salvation that Jehovah has made through his Son.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Built up spiritually, you had a full share in the service in April. For the first time over six million hours were reported—actually, 6,658,909 hours spent in preaching the good news. The magazines —including special issues with timely information—were distributed throughout the land as never before. There were 8,222,037 copies placed in the hands of the public —438,164 more than in any previous month. And the final month of the subscription campaign showed a new peak of 226,753 obtained, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)-</span><span class="font12">scriptures on doctrinal points. For example, if we are giving our presentation right from the Bible and are emphasizing the need of acquiring understanding, we can turn to page 1436 and call attention to pertinent references under “Understanding” such as Proverbs 3: 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Let us consider some opportunities to offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font12"> Of course, the house-to-house ' activity is our best source for finding persons who need the Word of Life, and it is good to set aside time to share in this feature of service regularly. Persons who obtained subscriptions or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> books previously may be glad to obtain the A'ew </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation.</span><span class="font12"> Also, what about our many back-calls and Biblestudies?

<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Talk on theme for month. (See July 1 &quot;Watchtower.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Suggested sermons for July through September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Religion That God Approves Matt. 7:13, 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2 Tim. 3:16</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you have had good success with the sermon theme “Religion That God Approves” you may want to continue using it. After brief introductory remarks, such as, &quot;I’m glad to find you at home,” you might say, &quot;The reason for my brief call is to ask if you have noticed the growing trend to set aside the Bible.” (Allow for response.) If householder is hesitant to reply, you can comment about the general failure to live by Bible standards. If householder agrees there is such a trend, it may be well tactfully to point out that even some religious leaders are discrediting the Bible, discouraging people from reading it, etc. Ask what he thinks about God’s view, of such religious leaders. Turn to page 11 of the “Truth” book and read Matthew 7:13, 14. Further discuss material as the situation permits and offer the “Truth” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Or, you may want to use the following theme:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Grand Blessings from God Near at Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rev. 21:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Titus 1:2</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In our presentations it is good to have in mind getting the householder to (1) think things out, and (2) make some expression. Depending on his response or lack of such, we can adjust our presentations accordingly. We can give our sermon from the Bible first if we feel that is the best way to do things and then offer the “Truth” book later. In some cases we may want to offer just the Bible-study folder at first and then, after discussing its contents, offer the &quot;Truth” book. Whatever approach you select, endeavor to get the householder into a conversation and keep your presentation simple and to the point. 15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of insert on pioneering, from &quot;A Satisfying Way of Life” to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Talk on material in &quot;Question Box.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Include following points: At assemblies, being in our seats and concentrating on what is said during the sessions will enable us to get the most benefit ourselves and we will not be distracting others. Picking up things on the floor will take a considerable load off the cleaning department, and this is much appreciated. Courtesy when standing in lines is always appreciated, isn’t it? In traveling to and from assembly site, we should remember <sub>t </sub>that people are observing our conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">—2 Cor. 6:3. Song 28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">the opportunity to obtain the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation?</span><span class="font12"> Are there hotels or motels that do not have Bibles?^ Managers are sometimes glad to get low-cost modern-English Bibles for their rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Since it is the Word of Life we are offering to people and </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jives</span><span class="font12"> are involved, we are interested in not only buying out as much Hm&amp;,.as we can to offer the Bible in our territory during the month of June, but also in employing </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">effec</span><span class="font12">tive teaching methods. As we do things in this way Jehovah’s rich blessing will attend our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a Marvelous Report! </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">which pushed the grand total for the four-month campaign 12,214 over the former peak to a new high of 692,052.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The literature placed accomplishes much good, but it is obvious that your interest in those who obtain it does not stop with your first call. Your back-calls and Bible studies prove it. In April you made 2,966,099 return calls on interested ones, more than a quarter of a million more than ever in the past. And again the Bible studies hit a new peak—342,131. Though the March report seemed to indicate that quite a few unproductive studies had been dropped after six months, apparently these have been replaced with over 27,000 new ones 1 How many of these thousands will be with us at the “Peace on Earth” International Assembly in July?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FULL-TIME SERVICE-YOUTH’S SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">«T </span><span class="font0">EHOVAH is taking pleasure in his </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font0">people.” (Ps. 149:4) Just think of that, brothers! Our great God, Jehovah, takes pleasure in us, even though we are only tiny dust particles on this small earth in his vast universe. Though we are living scattered “in among a crooked and twisted generation,” still he notices us and rejoices. (Phil. 2:15) Why? Because we are the ones he has seen to be righteous, the ones who are doing his will, among this generation. (Gen. 7:1) Yes, we have offered ourselves willingly in this day when he will take military action against this wicked system of things.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among Jehovah’s people there are many dedicated youths. Are you one of these? If you are, rejoice that you too have a share in making Jehovah’s heart happy! (Prov. 27:11) Will you be finishing school soon? If so, what have you decided to do after you graduate? Or, are you one who has already finished school? What course of activity are you pursuing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, there may be a tempting offer of higher education or of going into some field of work that promises material rewards. However, Jehovah God holds out to you young folks many marvelous privileges of service in his organization. Which will you decide to take up? In view of the short time left, a decision to pursue a career in this system of things is not only unwise but extremely dangerous. On the other hand, a decision to take advantage of what God offers through his organization opens up excellent opportunities for advancement as well as a rich, meaningful life that will never end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are out of school, can you take advantage of the many grand privileges open to you in the service of Jehovah God? One way you can do this is by deciding to enter the ranks of full-time service as a pioneer. There is a great need for full-time preachers and teachers today. It is a field of activity with a marvelous future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Think of Jehovah’s Christian ministry as a delightful corridor down which we are walking. Along this corridor is a large glass door, and, peering through it, we see another corridor with other doors leading to various privileges of service. We notice that one glass door is marked Pioneer Service and the other doors beyond it are marked Special Pioneer Service, Bethel Service, Gilead Training and Missionary Service. Going through these doors offers you the splendid opportunity to use your life to the full in Jehovah’s service. Will you put yourself in a position to do so by walking through the door marked Pioneer Service?—1 Cor. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, will you make yourself available for greater privileges of service in the organization that Jehovah has purposed to preserve forever? Or will you pursue a career in this-unhappy, dying system of things? Consider what other youths decided when they were faced with the decision that you must now make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">TURNING DOWN WORLDLY OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO PIONEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many young brothers and sisters were offered scholarships or employment that promised fine pay. However, they turned them down and put spiritual interests first. In some cases this was not easy, because of pressure from the world to take up its offers. For example, one young brother in Florida was offered a four-year scholarship in engineering at the University of Miami. One of his teachers did all he could to convince this young man to go to college. He even took him to visit some of these institutions to let him see what they were like, thereby hoping to get him to take advantage of the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What did this brother decide to do? He went into the full-time pioneer service. Did he make the right decision? Well, think about this: During his pioneering he helped a family of five to take up Jehovah’s pure worship. The father of the family was baptized in six months’ time and later became a servant in the congregation. Also this pioneer helped two teen-agers to get on the road leading to life. Is it likely that he would have been able to do this if he had spent most of his time studying engineering in college?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These persons are truly seven precious letters of recommendation to which he can point with joyful satisfaction. They are the fruitage of his loving labors, which were blessed by God, and don’t you agree that they are worth far more than a degree in engineering?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also he received many other fine privileges of service. He was appointed as a servant in his congregation, was active in the circuit assembly organization and was on the assembly program. His pioneer life was rich. Was? Yes, for he is now serving at Bethel, where he is enjoying many more privileges of service. He looks back with no regrets, and he advises all who want to expand their privileges of service and add to their happiness to take up the full-time preaching work. He said: “Nothing the world offered me could compare with what I have enjoyed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other young folks who are pioneering now have been offered opportunities for lucrative jobs. In turning down such in order to take up pioneer work they may have had to do with less materially, but they have what they need. How do they feel about this? Consider this single sister who is in her late twenties. She could be earning much money in a worldly position. Yet she has been happily pioneering in Yonkers, New York, for eight years. During this time she has helped a mother of many children to learn the truth that leads to eternal life. She is also having the joy of seeing some of this mother’s children follow her in the way of pure worship. And how happy she is to see that the father is also coming to some meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How does she feel about her decision to pursue the full-time preaching work? “Anything a person does in the. world can only add up monetarily, but to me it is worthless. The joys and blessings of being a pioneer are worth far more than anything in the world. If a young person who was graduating from school asked me what to do, I would reply, If you truly want lasting happiness, pioneering will bring you that happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMMENDABLE ATTITUDE OF WILLINGNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To answer Jehovah’s call for more full-time workers, an attitude of willingness is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Are you willing to take up this busy but happy way of life? It means cultivating the desire to do more than the usual. Not only that, it also requires looking at things positively, not negatively. Such a view will move one to work toward the goal of pioneer service in a determined manner. Jehovah will indeed bless such a willing attitude and course of action.—Prov. 23:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An example of this is seen in the attitude of a brother who was a pioneer twenty-two years ago. At a convention he went to hear the talk for Gilead applicants, and he applied for Gilead. He also went to hear the talk on Bethel service, and he applied for this, too. The brother who gave both talks recognized him and asked him if he had not already applied for Gilead. The pioneer answered “Yes,” and when he was asked why he was applying for Bethel too, his reply showed his attitude of willingness. He said: “I am willing to do whatever Jehovah wants me to do. Wherever his organization feels I am needed, that is where I want to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was called to Bethel and has since enjoyed many marvelous privileges of service. He has served in various positions of responsibility and has given talks at assemblies. Jehovah has blessed him richly for his willing spirit! If you manifest such a willing spirit and enter the pioneer work, you, too, will be blessed in ways you cannot imagine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps you feel that you should wait awhile before going into the pioneer work, in order to buy a car or build a bank account. But many who held back from going into pioneer work for one reason or another have never gone into it. They kept procrastinating. Others found themselves going into it later than they expected and wished they had not held back. Why not view the matter the way the apostle Paul did. Having sustenance and covering, be content.—1 Tim. 6:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Listen to the thoughts expressed by this sister who is a special pioneer with her husband in Demopolis, Alabama: “As graduation [from high school] approached, I made a definite decision to pioneer and increase my privilege of service. It was not an easy decision. The question kept going through my mind whether I would be able to do it. But I prayed for strength and courage, and resolved that I could pioneer in Jehovah’s strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Even before graduation I turned in my application so that I would be 'sure to do just as I had resolved in my heart. Later I was married and my husband, after a while, joined me in the pioneer work. This brought us closer together. Now we are enjoying a privilege we hardly dreamed of several years ago, the special pioneer work. I am so thankful that Jehovah has progressively extended all these privileges of service to me and I am certainly glad that I made the right decision eight years ago to trust in his strength.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such words are evidence of the contentment that is the lot of this happy sister. Jehovah has indeed blessed her willing spirit and her firm resolve to do his work full time. She reports that after only six months in their special pioneer assignment, she and her husband have had many rewarding experiences and joys in aiding lovers of righteousness to become associated with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In New Jersey a young brother wanted so much to pioneer that he began pioneering during the last six months of high school and continued right on after he graduated. “Looking back on my decision,” he observes, “I can see that the full-time preaching work is the privilege in which to share. I cannot imagine leaving the ranks. Now I am at Bethel and I am enjoying many wonderful privileges of service. I have never been as happy anywhere else.” At present, he is privileged • to serve in the service department here at headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A young sister in Ohio wanted to pioneer right after she left school, but her father expected her to take the responsibility of organizing herself financially to do it. Therefore she had to spend some time to prepare for this, but she never lost sight of her goal. Her willingness moved her to enroll as soon as she was able to do so. Were all her efforts worth it? During her five years of happy pioneer service, she helped twenty persons to accept God’s truth. What a reward for her love of Jehovah! Further, she has gone through Gilead School and is now serving as a busy missionary in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are many pioneers in the ranks who prepared to pioneer by vacation pioneering when they were going to school. This stimulated them to pursue this blessed way of life. Have you vacation pioneered and tasted the pleasures of this full-time service? If you have, do you not agree that it is the ideal work to do now? If you have decided to go into pioneer work, this is truly commendable. However, whether you have vacation pioneered or not, why not consider the reasons why Jehovah’s service is truly the only satisfying way of life for youths today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A SATISFYING WAY OF LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pleasing Jehovah God in all that we do and helping our fellowman serve God are basic requirements for a meaningful, satisfying way of life. Our regular activity in the Christian ministry gives us a sense of satisfaction. Whether we spend ten, twenty or one hundred hours a month we experience this satisfaction. Naturally, the more time we spend in Jehovah’s happy service, the greater will be the rewards and blessings.—2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You young folks who are single and those of you who are married, can you take up this satisfying way of life as a full-time pioneer? If your health and responsibilities allow for it, you will experience for yourself why serving Jehovah full time as a pioneer, at Bethel or in a missionary assignment is indeed the most satisfying work to pursue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First, there is the supreme joy of knowing that you are doing your best to devote all your energies to Jehovah’s service. If you are in position to pioneer, it is the right thing to do! Since sharing in serving Jehovah brings us the greatest happiness, doing so full time will bring you delightful contentment and unspeakable pleasure. It will draw you closer to him! His command at Psalm 100:2 will take on a fresh meaning for you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Second, there is the tremendous satisfaction that you are helping people to get on the road to eternal life. Imagine seeing such ones survive Armageddon and enjoy life in paradise forever. Is there any other work in this system that could be so beneficial and long-lasting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Third, your involvement with Satan’s system of things is cut down to an absolute minimum while your life becomes more and more involved with Jehovah’s organization and spiritual matters. Yes, and with each passing day you ■ are more and more built up spiritually instead of being torn down by the filth of this old order. This will help you to “flee from the desires incidental to youth.” —2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fourth, you derive great satisfaction from knowing that you are getting better equipped to take on whatever assignment Jehovah will give you in his new order. Why not begin now while you are young to cultivate this willingness? Yes, get a head start!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fifth, there is the inestimable satisfaction of engaging in a work that is so important and one that will never again be repeated. Think how you will feel when you look back to these days and can say, “I was in the front ranks of those bearing witness to Jehovah’s name in those last days!” Truly, such a feeling could never be valued in terms of money, could it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The many blessings from Jehovah’s hands make full-time pioneer work the ideal way of life for youths today. These blessings are loving evidences of his approval. Those in full-time service for some time can best tell us about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT SATISFIED FULL-TIME SERVANTS SAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consider the sister who is now a missionary in Medellin, Colombia. She pioneered for a while, went to Gilead School and was sent to her foreign assignment about two years ago. Since she has been there she has helped four persons to dedication and baptism. What are her thoughts about the life she is pursuing? She comments: “I find that the missionary work is nothing like I had imagined. The spiritual values of the missionary work outweigh all the changes one must make in a foreign land, change in climate, customs, culture, foods and, most of all, the language. When at last you can give your sermon in the language (here it is at every door) and see the smiles and joys in the faces of the people as you help them for the first time experience spiritual freedom, you know that nothing can compare with it.” Yes, you can sense the deep satisfaction she has in the rich life she is leading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here is another missionary who is serving in Cotonou, Dahomey, in Africa. When she was asked about her thoughts on her work and way of life, she answered: “I am happy for this privilege to express myself, because, of all the features of full-time service that I have enjoyed, the work in the missionary field has been the most rewarding. Living conditions are far better than I ever anticipated and all the missionary homes that I have seen and visited are very comfortable and well equipped. The field ministry is a real joy and we have a ‘waiting list’ of people who would like to study the Bible with us.” Obviously, she has a busy life, but what satisfaction and joy are radiated in her words! Such satisfaction and increased happiness may be yours if you, too, pursue a fulltime preaching career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ponder on the thoughts expressed by this brother. He has been in full-time service over fifteen years. “The happiest years of my life have been those in which I have devoted my full time and energy to Jehovah’s work. Not only that but each year that I am in Jehovah’s full-time work I get happier and happier. Despite Satan’s attempts to make me stop, I go to bed at night satisfied and glad at heart that my life is so full and rich. My prayers to Jehovah are always filled with thanksgiving for all that he has done for me, and I grow to love him more and more with each passing day. I look back on over five busy years as a pioneer and over ten joyful years in Bethel. Jehovah has been so good to me. I have had a fruitful ministry and one fine privilege of service after another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No doubt about it, young brothers and sisters, full-time service is indeed the most satisfying way of life. It is a life that will not only allow you to give of yourself but it will reward you in many ways that you cannot imagine. Why not seriously consider taking up this precious privilege? You will never be disappointed that you did!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1969 International Conventions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people in the United States and Canada are looking forward with keen anticipation to the assemblies to be held in eight cities during the month of July.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In the event you have not sent your room request forms to the city where you expect to attend, please do so right away. In making plans to attend an assembly include those interested ones with whom you are studying.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Publishers in all eight assembly cities appreciate the responsibility they have and are working diligently in securing rooming accommodations for you. Good rooming accommodations in private homes are being secured at reasonable prices. Please bear in mind that hotel rooms have increased in price in just the last few years. There are very few rooms at the lowest price listed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Koom assignments will be mailed directly to you wherever possible. Write down the address of your accommodation on a slip of paper and put it in your wallet so you will not lose it. Frequently our brothers have lost the address and have had difficulty in knowing where to go. In the event you do not receive an assignment before you leave home you may obtain one at the rooming department at the convention city.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If some of you who are attending the assembly in New York receive a rooming assignment with a New Jersey address, this does not mean it is far removed from Yankee Stadium. In fact, it may be closer to the stadium than many accommodations in the city itself. Once at the assembly city you may prefer to travel by public transportation instead of using your automobile.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup>.Many have inquired about places to park campers, tents or trailers. There will be no such locations at any of the convention cities this summer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> In order to have a proper balance of attendance to correspond with the convention facilities we would like to repeat the request that those in Michigan and western Ohio attend the Chicago assembly instead of Buffalo. In this regard please review the April </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> When elderly people come to the convention, assistance for them in going to and from the stadium should be arranged by the congregation with which they are associated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Normally the rooming department moves to the convention site the day before the convention begins. This will not be the case for New York, Bos Angeles and Chicago, where ball games will be in progress. To procure rooms from rooming department the day prior- to its opening, you will have to go to the address on the reverse side of the request form in these three cities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>ln</sup> You may want to carry some literature with you en route to the convention cities to place whenever you have opportunity. Time spent in such incidental witnessing can be very profitable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> In all the cities a number of Kingdom Halls strategically located in areas near where you will be staying will have territories provided for field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER CAFETERIA TICKET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> Pioneers, be sure to bring your cafeteria ticket with you. It will serve as identification and also enable you to obtain literature at pioneer rates at the bookroom. Keep it in your wallet or purse and care for it as money.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSEMBLY BADGES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> In the event overseers have not ordered lapel cards for the congregation, do so right away. The celluloid badge holders are 5c, and the cards themselves are 1c each. Wearing these badges will be an excellent way in which you can become acquainted with others and also advertise the assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> The congregation should arrange to secure bumper signs if this has not already been done, indicating the name of the assembly city. The signs will be 4i/j&quot; by 20&quot;. These are attractively designed in fluorescent color. The sign is easily applied by removing a protective coating on the back and then sticking it on a clean surface such as the bumper. It may be well to wax the bumper before putting the sign on. If you wish, the sign may be applied to a board or firm material and then fastened to the bumper. These signs are 10c each and will serve as a fine' means to advertise the assembly while en route to your convention city.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> As you know, a tremendous amount of work is required to take care of our brothers’ comforts and needs while at the assembly. Statistics show that one out of every seven is required to participate in some assignment in order to take care of the work required in the various departments. Please offer your services.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN-LANGUAGE PROGRAMS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> Spanish programs will be held in conjunction with the Atlanta, New York and.Chicago assemblies, with an all-Spanish convention (no English) at Pomona, California.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> There will be a full French program at the New York assembly, held in a tent near Yankee Stadium. This will accommodate Frenchspeaking delegates from Europe, Quebec, the Caribbean, and any others who may come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> Sessions in other languages will also be held at Yankee Stadium in the mornings, Wednesday through Saturday. Included will be Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese and Swedish.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SAVING SEATS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>19</sup> Frequently when seats are saved for a group, not all show up. This means others are deprived of seats that may not even be used. When the sessions start, all should be in their seats. The attendant will then endeavor to fill ALL seats.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thoroughly Working Our Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Because lives are involved we want to give all persons in our assigned territory ample opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. (Ezek. 3:17, 18) Therefore, we make it a point to work our territory regularly and thoroughly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How can we be certain that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font12">of the homes in a territory are visited? Well, when we check out a territory and others are assisting us in working it, it would be appropriate to encourage them to keep complete and accurate records of not-at-homes. If these publishers will not be able to make return calls on the not-at-homes, then why not get the house-to-house records from them and personally see that such calls are made. Make repeated efforts to call on not-at-homes, calling at different times and days. Sometimes much persistence is required to get the desired results. Persist in calling until you find someone at home. Prestudy activity ■ provides a fine opportunity to make such calls. And, when there are many calls to make, an entire evening can be set aside for calling on not-at-homes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">1969 Conventions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd)</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> Since some seats will not be under cover, you may wish to bring along an umbrella for shade if you have one.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEAF MUTES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>21</sup> There will be a deaf-mute section at all the assemblies in English.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>22</sup> As a precautionary measure, regardless of which assembly you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in the car. Keep whatever you have locked in the trunk.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VISITING BROOKLYN FACTORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>23</sup> On July 5 and 6 (Saturday and Sunday), between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., those attending the New York assembly will be able to visit the Brooklyn factory and Bethel home and observe them in full operation. For those who cannot come early to take advantage of these two days, the mornings of Wednesday through Saturday of the convention week will provide opportunities for such a tour.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When persons are not found at home on weekends, possibly they can he contacted some evening during the week. Publishers doing evening witnessing have remarked that it is almost like working unassigned territory, since they find so many persons who have not had much opportunity to hear the Kingdom message previously because of not being at home when we normally call. During the summer months, when it is lighter during the evening hours, why not consider the possibility of evening activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As has been suggested previously, a separate house-to-house record of not-at-homes can be kept. Make it your personal responsibility to see that all such calls are made. In the event you cannot make such calls, give the house-to-house records to tlie book study servant. These addresses can then be given to publishers sharing in evening activity who do not have not-at-home calls of their own to make. At times it may not be possible to find persons at home even after repeated efforts are put forth. Possibly publishers confined to their homes could write to such ones on the basis of the complete information supplied on the house-to-house records given to them. Also, leaving the Bible study folder at not-at-home calls will acquaint them with our free Bible study program, won’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Have you thought of the advantages of having smaller groups working territories? With only a few publishers, the same ones, working a territory, it will no doubt take a number of weeks for them to cover it thoroughly. As a result, back-calls and not-at-homes will be in a more confined area, requiring less traveling to call on such persons. This is much better than having many publishers cover a territory one week and then go to another territory the next week, thereby having back-calls and not-at-homes scattered over a wide area, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>e</sup> Thoroughly working our territory will take more time, true. We willingly put forth the extra effort, having in mind our objective of giving all persons the opportunity to hear the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• What can be done with older magazines that have accumulated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you have a consistent oversupply, we suggest that you adjust your magazine order, or endeavor to devote more time to magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, an accumulation of magazines can also result from circumstances over which you have no control. There may be sickness or bad weather, or you may be working in a territory where it is difficult to make placements. Then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do not destroy the magazines; they contain information that can aid others to get on the road to life. Why not take note of the specific articles in the magazine and ask yourself who of your neighbors, relatives or other acquaintances would particularly enjoy them. Share the magazines with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Also, when working from house to house, you may leave back issues where you find no one at home. Only one magazine should be left, not two. Put it where it will be protected from bad weather, if possible. It might fit under the door, between the outer door and the inner one, or rolled up and firmly lodged next to the door handle. Put do not use the mailbox. Then when you return to the notat-home calls, you can mention your earlier visit and ask if the householder found the magazine that you left as a gift for him. If he read it, he may be glad to obtain the current ones on the regular contribution. And if you have great difficulty in finding certain persons at home, at least they will have opportunity to read the “good news.” Keen in mind that only back issues of the magazines should be used in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some publishers have also had excellent results in visiting hospitals, poor farms and old-age homes and, as ministers, with the permission of the one in charge, talking to patients and leaving free copies of older magazines with those who will read them. In all these ways, good use can be made of any older magazines that you may have.</span></p>

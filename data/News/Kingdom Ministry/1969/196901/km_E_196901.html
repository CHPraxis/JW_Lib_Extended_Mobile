<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL XII NO. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">'Lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—Luke 21:28.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^PuMishtS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Each day the thoughts of your fine work and your prayers in our behalf seem to draw us ever closer together. What a joy to be “God’s fellow workers” at this time! (1 Cor. 3:9) Look at the tremendous expansion of Kingdom interests taking place before our very eyes! It makes us want to work harder, do more, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not long ago Brother Knorr told us of his recent visit to several European branches where arrangements were made to accelerate the production of literature to meet a growing demand. During the past month a second shift (a night shift) has started to work at the Society’s printing plant in Germany. More workers were brought in, new equipment has been installed and efforts are now under way to achieve a big increase in the production of bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Here in Brooklyn an already fast work pace seems to be gaining even greater momentum. Within recent months four new rotary presses have been received, another four are to be delivered by the middle of the year, and three others have just been ordered for delivery late in I960. That will give us here a total of 29 rotary presses! And, too, within the next six months we are expecting three more full lines of bindery equipment, which will make eight production lines in all! Think what a flood of printed truth will flow out as a result!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Here is another exciting recent development. You already know about the Society’s circuit assembly hall here in ’New York city. This hall is the scene of a circuit assembly almost every week of the year. Gilead graduations are also held there. Now, brothers in Detroit and Los Angeles have acquired and dedicated similar assembly halls. Brother Knorr was present at both dedications. While in California, he spoke to a crowd of 44,803 at the Anaheim Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At present Brother Knorr is on a trip of several weeks through the Caribbean area and South America,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Ready?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Yes, are you ready to share fully in the many blessings in store during the thirty-first </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">campaign, extending from January through April? Good success will depend much upon preparation. You are already convinced from your own knowledge of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">that it contains valuable spiritual instruction for those who are ‘seeking God, if they might grope for him and really find him.’ (Acts 17:27) With this conviction, you are ready to Speak enthusiastically and convincingly to others in recommending subscriptions for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> But we are sure you appreciate that more is needed to be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">fully</span><span class="font13"> prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> You are invited to check yourself on these points for preparation : (1) Sermon reviewed, with specific thoughts in mind for the introduction and tying In the offer. (2) Some definite points selected to talk about in the current issjie of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> (3) Service schedule examined to see that there are definite times set aside for regular house-to-house work. (4) Various other opportunities determined for offering subscriptions, such as when calling on interested ones, and when talking to relatives, friends, business associates and tradesmen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Let us consider each of these four points more in detail. The suggested sermon is the same one used in October, with the theme “Is It where he will look after demands stemming from growing Kingdom interests in those parts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Once more we are more than eager to get started upon another fourmonth </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign, because this campaign promises to produce even greater results than those achieved in past years. So, please, brothers, continue to remember us in your prayers as we, together with you, lift up our heads, knowing that deliverance is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your brothers, </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span><span class="font13"> Later than You Think?” You may use another sermon of your choice, if you wish. The important thing is to have definite points in mind when going to the door. Brief, meaningful words spoken in Introduction will get you off to a good start and right into a discussion of appropriate portions of 2 Timothy 3:1-5. Now you can skillfully direct the householder’s attention to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> Articles in each issue during January and February will tie in well with the suggested sermon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In the January 1 issue there is an article entitled “How </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> Influences Lives.” You will find a number of fine points you can use in this article. Have you noticed, too, that for several months </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> has been featuring material from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book? Discussions of the sign of the “last days,” the Kingdom’s establishment and provisions for a paradise earth will be among those included in issues for the next few months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Now to your service schedule. Even though the weather is usually colder in much of the country in January, are there ways to get in more house-to-house work, especially on milder days? As our theme for the month reminds us, there is need to 'buy out the time during these wicked days.’ (Eph. 5:16) In addition to taking full advantage of the congregation’s arrangements for group witnessing, perhaps plans can be made to go out at other times during the week. Discuss your plans with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> How many other opportunities for getting subscriptions can you think of? Have you pointed out to those with whom you are studying or on whom you are making back-calls the value of having </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> come to their homes regularly? They will probably subscribe for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> also. Isn’t it true that the progress they make often </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 7, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: “Be Rich in Fine Works, . . . Ready to Share.&quot; (1 Tim. 6:18) Song 109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: “Are You Ready?” Question-and-answer coverage of article. When paragraph 3 is discussed, suggested sermon may be discussed and demonstrated. (See September 1968, “Kingdom Ministry,” pa^e 2, for several presentations.) Specific points to highlight in latest issue of “The Watchtower” may be mentioned. In handling paragraph 6, audience should be encouraged to mention as many practical opportunities as they can think of for obtaining subscriptions. 12 min: Who Need Help to Share in Obtaining Subscriptions? It is suggested that assistant congregation servant handle this part. Checking the Publisher’s Record card file carefully will help him make a practical analysis and offer helpful observations to the congregation as a whole, without mentioning situation of any individual publishers. Likely he will find many have experienced the joy of obtaining subscriptions and placing magazines during past year. In some instances, he may find most subscriptions were obtained by just a few publishers. Younger publishers may need help in obtaining subscriptions, although placing a good many magazines. Based on his analysis, he can make practical recommendations to help obtain subscriptions, having in mind their respective opportunities. 14 min: &quot;How We Place Our Magazines.&quot; Consider “Kingdom Ministry” insert material down to the heading “Store-to-Store Magazine Work.” Have lively discussion of first section with audience. Demonstrate briefly the different presentations under “Magazine Street Work&quot; and discuss how these might be used in doing street witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">9 min: Concluding comments. Consider Theocratic News and How Did We Do in November? Song 107.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Jehovah Adds the Increase as We Diligently Preach His Word. (Acts 6:7) Song 68.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: Making Good Use of the “Yearbook&quot; Daily. Demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(5 min.) Chairman discusses value of having good daily routine in using “Yearbook.&quot; Some time during each day should be set aside for consideration of day’s text and comments, and it is beneficial to read a few experiences from around the world at that time or at another time during the day. How many have time to go back and review all the main, points of study articles in &quot;The Watchtower&quot; for past year? Yet in “Yearbook&quot; w'e have these points reviewed for us. These few minutes each day are invaluable part of schedule to keep spiritually strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(11 min.) Chairman demonstrates by interview with four or five family heads (two sisters with unbelieving mates could be included) how families can fit consideration of “Yearbook” into their schedules each day. (Use situations that actually exist in your congregation.) Many find discussion can be conducted before breakfast each morning, when all the family are together. For some it is more convenient to do so during breakfast or after the meal and before dismissal. Perhaps one brother works nights or leaves for work very early in the morning, and finds it better to do so at end of day. Sister with opposed mate may discuss text with children after home from school and before husband arrives from work. All discuss benefits of using &quot;Yearbook” regularly and holding to set time each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) Chairman summarizes discussion: (1) Setting aside definite time each day. (2) Reviewing past information in “The Watchtower” helps keep us spiritually strong. (3) Reading experiences draws us closer to our brothers in other lands and we learn from their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">14 min: “How We Place Our Magazines.&quot; Consideration of second part of &quot;Kingdom Ministry” insert, from “Store-to-Store Magazine Work&quot; down to the heading “Magazine Routes.” Magazine-territory servant might handle this part and, by audience discussion and demonstrations, show how others have been effective in store-to-store and house-to-house magazine witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: How Are the New Ones Progressing? Suggest that Bible study servant handle. He can analyze Bible study file and discuss the progress made since last summer. We received “Truth” book last July and August at the district assemblies. If started studies in this book in August or September, about four months have gone by. In view of goal to have new ones progress to point of attending the meetings with us by the end of six months’ study, what. progress has been made along this line? The last seven minutes can be used to get expressions from audience. Perhaps some publishers have invited new ones but as yet they haven't come. Why? What can be done? Let audience suggest ways to help. Could be new one is timid, lacking in appreciation, has no transportation, needs helping hand, or just not interested. Local experiences can be worked in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate Announcements. Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">8 min: “Keeping the Publishers Supplied.&quot; Literature servant and magazine-territory servant might discuss together how they can work with overseer and publishers in having ample supply of literature and magazines on hand at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: “How We Place Our Magazines.” “Kingdom Ministry” insert, from “Magazine Routes” to the end. Handle by audience participation and discourse. It should stand out that there are many ways we can use the magazines extensively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Are You Encouraging to Others?” Overseer might handle as discourse. Using “Kingdom Ministry&quot; article as outline, he will be able to bring in choice points and illustrations from the following issues of “The Watchtower”: July 15, 1968, pp. 424436, and August 1, 1965, p. 455. Make it a warm and heartfelt talk showing how all can be encouraging every day. 10 min: Concluding comments. Give report on subscriptions received so far. Song 108.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Service meeting should be prepared locally. Overseer can check with other servants to see what might profitably be handled on this meeting and then make up practical, balanced program. The latest circuit servant’s report will be helpful in determining what needs attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Share the Comfort from the Scriptures. (Rom. 15:4) Song 40. 10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Talk on theme for month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">(8 min.) Demonstrate how study can be started in “Truth” book by using folder on first call or on back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) Chairman points out advantages of starting s'tudies in “Truth” book in most instances, whether on first call or on back-call. This can be done even if publisher does not have folder with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Review of Suggested Sermon. Have used for one month. How can we achieve variety and work in new points from current issue of “The Watchtower”? Prepared publisher can offer sample presentation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A very fine report! Look at the results of our united efforts to place the “Truth” book with all whom we met. We placed 817,766 books! Marvelous, indeed! Obviously, • placing books was not our only goal, for 2,398,497 back-calls were made. Yes, we wanted to cultivate the interest that persons showed in God’s truth. Furthermore, consider that 307,331 Bible studies were conducted in the homes of such interested ones. Brothers, this represents a. fine spirit and a commendable willingness to do more than the usual to help others gain eternal life. Keep up the very fine work!</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>HOW WE PLACE OUR MAGAZINES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">O</span><span class="font0">UR tremendous increase in distribution of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> is truly amazing—from 20 million placed world wide in 1951 to 157,511,892 distributed in 1968! Thus, whereas each publisher (including pioneers) in 1951 placed, on an average, 52 magazines during the year, in 1968 publishers throughout the world averaged 136 magazine placements. In the United States publishers and pioneers together averaged 200 magazine placements in 1968. Very good indeed! In fact, our best ever. But is there reason to strive to do even better?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, for when we see the benefits that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> can bring to people, there is strong incentive to give these magazines even wider circulation. Why, each issue contains information that can assist truth-seekers onto the road to eternal life and happiness. One sister in St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, reports that it was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> picked from a garbage can that directed her to Jehovah’s organization. That magazines often can have such a wonderful effect is seen from many experiences in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.—</span><span class="font0">See the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1967 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font0"> pages 86, 182, 273, 292-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, to increase our placements, it is first important to appreciate the vital part </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower and Awake!</span><span class="font0"> have in spreading the good news of the Kingdom. Even though<sup>1 </sup>persons may have limited interest in our message, they are often willing to accept magazines containing short articles. Then they, or perhaps others in the home, will pick up and read an article and have their interest aroused. It has occurred many times. Therefore, if it can be arranged, it is a fine thing if we can devote at least part of a day each week toward giving the magazines the widest distribution possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But what are effective ways of offering the magazines? How can we encourage persons to accept them? And in what features of the ministry may they be presented? Let us note some suggestions from those who have enjoyed fine success in magazine distribution.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Magazine Street Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">For some publishers, offering magazines on the street has proved especially effective. Writes one congregation servant: “We place 85 percent of our magazines doing street work right here in Americus, Georgia, on Saturday morning.” The overseer of another Georgia congregation that maintains a monthly average' of 24 magazines per publisher observes: “Saturday evening is shopping night, and each time publishers do street work they return with empty bags. Our pioneers place anywhere from 70 to 100 magazines when they stand on the street.” Some circuit servants also do exceedingly well in this feature of the ministry. One who regularly places over 300 magazines a month writes: “Saturday I placed 117 magazines and 10 books. Two weeks later I used the same approach and placed 133 magazines and 33 books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“What approach,” you may ask, “do publishers use who have such remarkable success in magazine street work?” They usually do not stand in one place. “I move slowly with the crowd,” the above-mentioned circuit servant explains. “I may say to a man: ‘I beg your pardon,’ and then go on with the presentation.” The presentation that he used the two Saturdays he enjoyed particularly good success was: “Hello! The doctors say there is a growing need for heart donors. Do you think heart transplants are going to work? The doctors give their answers in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> and this pocketsize book can be yours for 35 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The idea is to take the initiative. Approach people; sometimes it may be necessary to walk a few steps with them. Smile, look directly at the person and say perhaps, “Have you read the latest copy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower? </span><span class="font0">I’d like to share it and the latest </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font0">with you. They’re just 10 cents.” Be courteous, friendly and to the point in your presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Opportunities for presenting magazines to people on the street are many. Writes one circuit servant’s wife: “I take advantage of odd moments or when I have to wait for someone in service. For instance, I might approach people in parking lots or those sitting in automobiles waiting for their families to shop. The same thing also holds true with people that might be passing by.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Recently a Bethel sister said that she learned something from a 13-year-old sister in her congregation. They were on their way together to make a back-call. The young sister held two magazines by her side. As a person approached, she would catch his eye and briefly present the magazines. She placed about a dozen magazines in the few blocks’ walk to the back-call! Have you thought of trying this, or of offering magazines to people sitting in their cars or on a park bench, or perhaps to persons window-shopping? Many publishers have done so with good success. Why not try it?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Store-to-Store Magazine Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">“By far we place more magazines per hour by working from store to store,” writes one circuit servant’s wife. A district servant agrees: “Store-to-store work seems to lend itself to placing more magazines than any other way.” Other publishers will concur. A sister in a Washington, D.C., unit works the business territory, and she averages 600 magazine placements a month. Writes the congregation servant: “Most of the people have begun to look for her as one would the postman.” Obviously stores and other businesses are places not to be overlooked in magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A special pioneer in Pennsylvania writes: “We have calls in a tire shop, metal injection molding shop, dress factory, junk yard, lumber yard, and so forth. In regular business territory we find good calls in barber shops, meat markets, small groceries, milk stores, shoemakers, used car dealers, as well as on professional people such as doctors, lawyers, and so forth.” Some publishers also place many magazines in hospitals, rest homes and libraries. Do you have such opportunities for magazine placements in your territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Store-to-store magazine work especially requires tact, courtesy and brevity. When entering a place of business, ask for the owner or manager. Some publishers tell the manager that they are calling because they seldom meet business people at their homes and they do not want to overlook anyone. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One circuit servant who enjoys fine success in this activity explains how he does it: “I give my name, state that I am a minister and that I am calling on the business people in the area. I say: ‘I know that you are busy so I will be very brief.’ Then I mention the subject I am discussing, and state a point on it in a sentence or two. I then take </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> out of my underarm briefcase and show the particular article on the subject; then I offer the two magazines for a 10-cent contribution.” If the manager shows interest, you may ask permission to make a similar brief offer to the employees, or you may suggest leaving him a few copies for them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>House-to-House Magazine Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Undoubtedly we place the majority of our magazines with people in their homes. This generally is where we find many persons in a position to listen. But even here we do well to be brief, holding our presentations to around a minute or so, or even less. The object is to place many copies and let them do their own “talking.” Only if there is unusual interest will we give a further witness and arrange for a back-call or Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We should recognize that people are often busy, and especially is this true on Saturday, the day we usually devote to magazine distribution. So we can anticipate a householder’s objection. A district servant describes his approach: “I identify myself as a minister engaged in a Bible educational work. Then I state: ‘Most people are busy on weekends, as there is much to do and everything piles up.’ I then add: ‘Since people are often too busy to listen to oral sermons, the next best is printed sermons that we are offering people to consider at their convenience. They are just 10 cents.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many publishers have good success by giving theii’ introductory remarks with the magazines out of sight—in their pocket or briefcase. They also find it effective to have in their introduction a brief theme that ties in with a pre-selected article. For example, they might say: “I am a local minister, and am making an effort to talk to parents in the neighborhood because of the rising rate of crime and delinquency.” Then they pull out the magazine and tie such comments in with the article, and show how this material can benefit the householder personally. It is good to make such a personal application of the article being featured, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A circuit servant who regularly places over 200 magazines a month also offers these helpful suggestions: “I try to get the householder to accept the magazines in his hand, as this helps him to make up his mind to get them. After my introduction, I might say, ‘I have something I want to show you.’ I will have the magazine opened to the point of interest and hand them to the householder. While he is holding the magazines, I try to create interest in the article being featured by bringing up questions, not for him to answer, but that the article will answer.” Many effective publishers emphasize the importance of using questions to stimulate'the householder’s desire for the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What might be done if you meet a group of persons? “I talk to them all,” writes one circuit servant, “and distribute the magazines to them all as I talk. Often they all contribute for them.” Another circuit servant observes that if a person shows interest in a particular article he lets them know they can have extra copies for relatives and friends. Frequently, he says, they take a half-dozen or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is also good to attempt tactfully to overcome an initial objection. A householder might say: “I am not interested in Jehovah’s witnesses” or “in those magazines.” You could reply: “Well, I understand that; however, I came to bring you some information on how to get a good night’s sleep,” or whatever topic you may be featuring. At times the householder’s attention is'captured and the magazines can be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many publishers place a large percentage of their magazines in the regular house-to-house ministry when the regular offer is refused. For example, the following comments have proved successful when the subscription offer has been turned down: “Maybe you would like to think about it, and you can have the magazines come to your home some other time. However, I know you will want to read this article we have been discussing; you just keep it along with its companion. We accept just 10 cents to help pay for the cost of printing.” Or you might simply say: “Well, perhaps you can get this offer at another time. So, then, I’ll just leave your current copies of the magazines for just a dime.” Being alert to offer magazines on such occasions will greatly increase our distribution of them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Magazine Routes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">A number of pioneers and special pioneers recently wrote the Society that they place the majority of their magazines on magazine routes. A special pioneer who does so explains how such a magazine route can be established: “We keep a careful house-to-house record and call back on all placements. When we call back, we merely mention that we left the magazines before and have the new ones with an article we thought they would enjoy. We generally do not tell them how often we will call or try to obligate them to take so many each week or month. We just stop and place them. When persons seem to enjoy them and take them readily, we call on them more often until we have a regular route call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine routes thus provide a fine opportunity to build up a warm, friendly relationship with persons to whom magazines are regularly delivered every two weeks or so. A pioneer in Pennsylvania notes the obvious benefit of such an arrangement: “The majority of my Bible studies develop from my regular magazine route. You always have something new and interesting to talk about, and many times this can lead naturally into a Bible study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To establish and maintain a magazine route requires persistence. But the benefit derived from the personal contact and from discussing such wholesome magazine articles warrants the effort.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>At Every Opportunity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">It is not only in regular features of the ministry that we place our magazines. A vast number also are left by magazine-conscious publishers at practically every opportunity. They place them with the butcher, the baker, the grocer, the barber, the salesman who calls at their home, the garage attendant where they buy gasoline, and so forth. One sister, seeing a friend off on an airplane flight, took some magazines along to offer to people while she waited for the plane to leave. She placed sixteen. How many opportunities there are to distribute these wonderful magazines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One brother reported at an Indiana circuit assembly last spring that when two workmates said they would like to have a particular issue, he thought others might want the magazines too. “So I started talking to every individual. I had only four magazines with me, so I took orders for 42 more magazines. After such a good response, I decided to go to the personnel manager to see if I could get the names of everyone that works in the factory. Of course, he asked why I wanted the names and so I told him. Then I had to place his and his secretary’s names on my list!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What were the results? “It took me eleven days to get around to everyone in the factory, including all the supervisors and their secretaries. But out of all those people only four didn’t take the magazines. When I finished I had placed 266 magazines and made 94 back-calls!” Thus, by offering them in regular features of the ministry and at every other opportunity, we placed over 157 million magazines last year! Can you share to a fuller extent?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Preparing for Increased Distribution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Most of us may conclude that we </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font0"> increase our placement of magazines. But, as one district servant notes, a fundamental requirement is preparation: “Most publishers would have better success if they read the magazines before and knew their contents. Then they could select material and slant their presentation to fit the individual.” In addition to making our. presentations fresh and adaptable, preparation will also stimulate our enthusiasm for the magazines, and this, too, will contribute to our placing more of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a new issue arrives, some publishers do not view it as simply another magazine to offer in the territory. But they analyze its' appeal. They may have a neighbor or friend who has not been especially responsive to the truth, but who is interested in a particular subject. When this is discussed in the magazine, they place it with him, perhaps as a gift. Also, when an article deals with the police department or law enforcement, they see that the policemen and judges in town receive a copy. Appropriate articles on the medical profession are directed to those most interested in that subject. Or if </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> discusses automobiles or auto maintenance, they feature it at gas stations, used car agencies and so forth. By taking advantage of the many possibilities, we can further increase our distribution of magazines. But it will require thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not to be overlooked, too, are our special and semi-special issues. Many publishers have noted that they have wide appeal and are easily placed. Extra copies may be ordered and used for several months, combining them with a recent issue that may not be as easy to place in your territory. Cover the entire territory with them, and this also may serve to increase your placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Servants in the congregation can do much to prepare publishers for increased magazine distribution. The overseer of a Florida congregation that averages over 24 magazines a month per publisher observes: “Our magazine-territory servant is an ardent reader of both magazines. When the publishers get their copies he always has a talking point. His comments run something like this, ‘Say, brother, did you notice this article? Don’t you think it is going to appeal in our territory?’ ” Other overseers, at the conclusion of meetings, frequently call attention to articles of interest that can be featured to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us all buy out the time during these wicked days by being magazine-conscious publishers. Really, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> should have the greatest circulation of any magazines in the world. By each of us having a full share in their distribution, that day may come soon. How fine that would be!</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Encouraging to Others?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> One thing we all need constantly is encouragement. Jehovah recognizes this need and provides it for us through his Word, his spirit and his organization. He gives us a share in this fine work of encouraging others, for we are commanded to “consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, . . . but encouraging one another.”—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How can you “incite” a brother who is lacking in some feature of service? Well, to “incite” is to stir up, to spur on, to urge, to motivate. First, you yourself must have your heart in the ministry and possess the deep-seated enthusiasm that stirs up or inspires. You must have empathy, consideration and a sincere desire to give the brother ‘any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any sharing of spirit,’ and to show toward him ‘any tender affections and compassions.’ (Phil. 2:1) If encouragement to engage in the field service Is needed, do not expect a lot of progress at once; perhaps it will be just one step, say, an hour with you or another publisher on Sunday or on magazine day. If assistance in attending meetings is needed, arrange to attend just one of the weekly meetings to start with, for example, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> To increase your ability to encourage, observe the brothers who are most encouraging to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ This year Memorial will be held on April 1, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Invitations may be ordered on the handbill order blank, remitting 25c per 1,000. Handbills should be ordered at the same time for the special public talk, '’Why Almighty God Laughs at the Nations,” which will be delivered at congregations around the world on Sunday, March 30. A manuscript for this special public talk will be sent to all congregations in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ If it can be arranged, the congregation may have a neat chart showing the number of subscriptions received. This should be kept up to date using information from publishers’ field service reports as to new subscriptions obtained.</span></p>

They greet the brothers at the Kingdom Hall in a way that shows that they really are glad to see them. It is the good things of the service that they talk about. At meetings these encouraging brothers radiate joyful warmth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Servants, when you discuss the congregation report or some feature of service, how encouraged the congregation is when you speak positively, not negatively. One of the best things to incite to action is a good experience that bears on the subject, either a local experience or one from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font13"> Keep also in mind that those attending the meetings are usually the strongest publishers; therefore your objective is to encourage them so that they, in turn, will be able to incite others to love and fine works.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Encouragement should not be overlooked in the family circle. Husbands. make every effort to encourage your wives, and wives, your husbands. Pleasure expressed in one another’s ministry and that of the children helps more than we might realize. Joyful readiness to attend meetings or to engage in service rather than reluctance to get ready, complaints about being tired or the bad weather, and- so forth, will work wonders in encouraging the family. Try it and see!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping the Publishers Supplied</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How disappointing it is to run out of literature or magazines right in the middle of a campaign; or, worse still, to fail to have in stock what is needed when the campaign begins! This can be avoided if supplies needed are estimated as accurately as possible and ordered sufficiently in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What can be done to ensure having on hand what we need to preach the “good news” effectively? By checking the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font13">we can keep informed on literature offers for coming months. The literature servant should present his recommendations on what he feels should be ordered, based on his records from past years and how many publishers and pioneers are in the congregation now. It is suggested that the overseer announce to the congregation when an order will be going in so that publishers might make known to the literature servant their needs for particular items. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lamp”</span><span class="font13"> book, page 139, suggests; “In most congregations an order is sent just once a month, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font13"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Reody? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd)</span></p>

Besides those persons with whom you study, you are in an excellent position to witness to relatives and friends, whether personally or by letter. • And what about those with whom you work or do business?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah gives the assurance that he will add his blessing, if we prepare and then follow through with the proper motive. During the past three years, total subscriptions obtained have steadily climbed so that during the 1968 campaign 679,838 subscriptions were obtained. For the past two years, publishers have obtained, on an average, 1.3 during the four months; regular and vacation pioneers, 14.4; and special pioneers, 25.4 ; while working for goals of 2, 20 and 30, respectively, for the campaign. What will we do this year? Why not set a personal goal to work for? While the type of territory, the amount of time we can spend in the service and other factors have a definite bearing on the final results, it is good to set forth reasonable objectives we hope to reach with Jehovah’s help. The congregation could have as another goal covering all the assigned territory at least once with the subscription offer. Start the campaign right by being ready and by ‘buying out the opportune time’ to present </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Studies During the “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> With Jehovah’s blessing we hope to obtain many subscriptions for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> during the next four months. What a fine thing it will be to have the valuable information in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> going into the homes of these interested ones regularly. What will we do, though, to get Bible studies started where subscriptions have been obtained? What publication will be used? Of course, this depends upon the Circumstances. In some instances we can use one of the booklets placed when the subscription was obtained or we can use one of the articles in the latest issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> or we might, on the first few calls, use just the Bible in starting the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But ask yourself, What publication, in most instances, is going to be best for a regular home Bible study? Yes, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book. Now, how can you get into this publication without giving the Impression of just wanting to place more literature? Well, what about using the new folder, “Would You Like to Understand the Bible?” Why not place this with each one who subscribes for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> or, for that matter, obtains only the two magazines. Take the time to review some of the points in it on the first call, if time and other factors are favorable. This leads right up to the publication that will be used in conducting the free home Bible study offered, namely the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font13">book. The interested one might like to get a copy right then or you can suggest that you will bring an extra copy along next week when you get right into the Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> After.obtaining the subscription you might say: “I would like to leave with you this folder, which explains a special invitation Jehovah’s witnesses are making to all in the community. Notice the question asked on the front: 'Would you like to understand the Bible?’ Obviously all those who love God want to understand his Word, and we are sure you do too. On page 2 of the folder the question is asked, ‘Why read the Bible?’ and then the comment is made ‘Many people never have. Is that true of you?’ ” At this point you could read several or all of the questions there and could even lead into the questions at the bottom of this page.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> At the top of page 3 there is a personal invitation to have a Bible study. Read this as an offer from you to help the interested one and his family. The discussion will then naturally lead into where, when, at what cost, who may share in the discussion, which Bible translation will be used and what will be covered. You need not discuss all of these points in the folder if time does not allow. But 'now you are down to page </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font13"> and you will note that the folder states: “As an aid for such Bible discussion we recommend this book.” The features of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book are then set forth and It will be natural for you to make this available for the free home Bible study that is offered. If time does not allow for introducing the study arrangement on the first call, the folder can be left and then discussed on the back-call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Discernment will be needed, remembering that our goal is to start a Bible study and help the interested one onto the way that leads to life.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">after the close of the month.” Thus if the overseer submits an order for literature needed two months away, this will give almost two months for the order to be filled and to be shipped on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Magazines are regularly sent to each congregation according to its standing order. Publishers can help very much to be sure adequate magazines are on hand without overstocking by keeping the magazineterritory servant informed of their needs in advance. If, due to unexpected circumstances, you run out and more are needed, do not Hesitate to order them through the congregation. The Society will send them as quickly as possible, if ordered right away, but whenever possible any additional copies of certain issues should be ordered in advance, such as when the circuit servant is scheduled to visit, when there will be many vacation pioneers, etc. A checklist may be helpful to the overseer and others. involved in ordering literature. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• Since most newly interested ones are now going through the “Truth” book first, is it still recommended that the “Impossible to Lie&quot; and “Life Everlasting” books be studied by them before baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Yes, this is still recommended where both books are available in a language understood by them. (See page 6 of the “Lamp” book.) While these two books might not be studied in detail by the home Bible study method, as with the &quot;Truth” book, they should at least be read carefully before baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While keeping to the six months’ program of study in the “Truth” book, additional reading should be encouraged, including these two books. By the time the “Truth” .book is completed, those studying should be attending at least some meetings and know whether they want to serve Jehovah or not. If they are progressing, then circumstances will determine how we continue the study: whether to hold a regular home Bible study in either of the other two books or merely to assign them a chapter or two to read and then review them on this until both are completed. Many things they will already know from their own study and attending meetings so that just reviewing this material will be sufficient. Some chapters may require careful study because understanding is lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, if people want to be baptized before completing the reading of these two publications and being reviewed on them, and they qualify in every way and can answer the questions found on pages 7 to 40 of the “Lamp” book, then we will not hold them back. But knowledge and understanding of Jehovah's Word are very essential. They should not take this step forward until they know enough about the Bible, the organization and Jehovah's purposes to understand clearly the responsibilities they are accepting and have the strength to endure, without faltering, the trials that may beset them.</span></p>

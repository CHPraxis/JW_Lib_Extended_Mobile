<p><span class="font13">Another grand month of activity has passed already, and there are things we want to tell yon about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are happy to report that the refresher course for all our circuit and district servants has been successfully completed. It was really pleasurable to have them here, a different group during each week of May. In all, 365 brothers benefited from the course. And we of the Bethel Family had the chance to become better acquainted with these field representatives of -the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Next came the influx of branch servants and assistants from all parts of the world. Many from Europe and Africa met in Belgium and then (raveled from there June 6 on a chartered plane. Soon after, brothers came from faraway places such as Australia, Japan and the Fiji Islands. Monday evening, .Tune !), after our Bethel </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">Study, Brother Knorr introduced all of them to us briefly. A few of the branch servants gave brief reports of the progress of the Kingdom work in their lands—work accomplished often in the face of frying conditions. What a thrilling program that was!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As these 133 branch representatives live with us here and attend special meetings right up to convention time, we are happy to be able to speak to them individually, hear their mature comments on the day's text each morning, and even visit them briefly in their rooms as time permits. To have them here in our midst is a foretaste of the approaching “Peace on Earth” International Assembly. At the assemblies during ■Tidy you too will have the opportunity to hear their experiences, because these are part of the program. This is another reason not to miss the grand feast that Jehovah is preparing for us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We cannot close without mentioning the fine results of our united ministry during May. Had you noted the report? Just think! 351,951 pub</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Just knowing that you are one of Jehovah's people, answers? Psalm 33 :12. Yes, knowing the truth, being dedicated to Jehovah and having a commission from him is really the only basis for true happiness. Of course, we know that something more is needed too, don't we? Taking a closer look for the answer, Solomon said that work was necessary for happiness. (Eccl. 2:10; 3: 12, 13) Jesus Christ agreed.—John 4:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">- Since work is required for true happiness, can you be happy in July? Yes, by sharing fully in the activity Jehovah has arranged for his people during that month. There will be much to do. Now is the time to make plans If we are going to get it all done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> During July we will again have the privilege of offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font13">book. Your territory has been covered with it, you say? Rejoice! The good news is being preached! Besides, that coverage likely will prove to be a very good thing. If you call on someone already studying in the book, just say a few words that will help him appreciate the value of the book even more and will encourage him to continue. If you find someone who has the book but is not studying, remember your goal, namely, to help him see the need of studying, arranging for such then and there, if possible. If you find</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">lishers—the second-best for this service year! Indeed, only April’s report exceeded this figure. And the offer of books went over splendidly. Our placements were the highest since that all-time high of last November. Surely we can all rejoice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What a wonderful family we all belong to! Isn’t it. happifying just to reflect on the fact that we are Jehovah’s people? May this always be our lot!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">someone who has been offered the book before but refused it, remember, you are now engaging him in conversation, and this was your first objective, wasn’t it? Now having his attention, you can tactfully and helpfully give additional fine reasons for obtaining it. Undoubtedly you are now better acquainted with the material in the book yourself and can present it with greater skill. And then there will he many who have never seen the book. Present it enthusiastically and forcefully, appreciating that honest-hearted ones have no time to lose if they are going to learn the truth, make progress to dedication and baptism and press on to maturity in the short time remaining.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> 1 low will you present the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font13">book In the house-to-house work? You have many methods to choose from. Take into consideration your territory, your own ability and personality and be flexible as you talk to people. You may want to use the sermon “Religion That God Approves.” When using this sermon, some publishers were amazed to find how readily householders commented on the decline of respect for the churches when asked for their opinion. If you prefer, you may use “Grand Blessings from God Near at Hand” as discussed in the June </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Or, yon may decide to present the book directly, even reading a few sentences that you feel are striking. Our brothers have had success with a variety of presentations. Whatever you decide, “work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah” ’and you will be happy in that work.—Col. 3 : 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup> Have you been trying evening witnessing now that it stays light longer? A brother in Colorado who tried it says, “Recently I have been taking advantage of the afternoon and evening field service, and results have been beyond all expectations!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">(Note: Since all congregations will likely miss at least one service meeting during July because of the assemblies, we will leave it to the brothers locally to decide which service meetings should be scheduled for certain weeks. Congregation servants should feel free to make these adjustments.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JULY 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Find Happiness in Whole-souled Service. (Col. 3:23) Song 29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Return to Jehovah While There Is Yet Time,” Talk. Give full consideration to material, in July 1, 1969, “Watchtower” article and suggestions given in “Kingdom Ministry” on how to use it. Encourage publishers really to make the necessary effort to reach those who have left and who might yet return. Can draw audience into discussion at times. Encourage brothers to study article in advance and bring “Watchtower” with them. Demonstrate how call might be made. Congregation servant can coordinate this work so that it will not turn out that many publishers will call on some and no publisher will call on others. 20 min: &quot;What Makes You Happy?” Questions and answers. Apply assembly information to your congregation. Demonstrate points relative to offering “Truth” book that will be especially helpful to publishers in your congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Theme: Preach in Favorable Season or Troublesome Season. (2 Tim. 4:2) Song 38,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “The Barrier of Fear.” Questions and answers. Spend proportionately more time on that which applies in your congregation. Chairman can inquire, in advance, for methods that have worked for some publishers in your territory in overcoming barrier of fear. Some of these methods, or points from article, might be demonstrated. Emphasize the need for using discernment and showing loving consideration toward those on whom we call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Do You Get the Point?” Talk, based on article in June 1, 1969, “Watchtower.” Assign to a mature brother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JULY 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No suggestions are being made for this service meeting for the reason mentioned in the note above. If most of the publishers will be attending an assembly this week, likely the meeting will not be held. Otherwise, transfer another meeting to this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JULY 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: “You Must Love Your Neighbor as Yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) Song 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Presenting the Good News— “Loving Concern.” Questions and answers. Chairman should be sure to highlight the vital importance of back-call work now.

<p><span class="font12">12 min: Our Work for August. Chairman explains that offer for July continues through August. He can prepare for this by speaking, in advance, to publishers who have been successful in placing “Truth” books in July. Find out which sermons and presentations have been especially successful in your territory. If your congregation has been given unassigned territory to work, report on progress and outline plans for completing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Concluding comments. Song 61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Stimulating Our Brothers by Our Own Zeal. (2 Cor. 9:2) Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk on theme for month of August, “Stimulating Our Brothers by Our Own Zeal.” See August 1 “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">35 min: Blessings We Enjoyed at the 1969 International Assemblies. Congregation servant should outline this part in harmony with available capable brothers in local congregation. Should make assignments and give instructions before brothers leave for their assembly so those assigned can be prepared to report on certain days or certain parts of program. If brothers assigned know’ what is expected of them prior to their going to the assembly, their reports will be far more complete and interesting. They can then take appropriate notes. In fact, encourage all publishers to take notes. They can then contribute better to these discussions. Cover first half of assembly program at this service meeting and last half of assembly program on service meeting for week starting August 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Makes You Happy? </span><span class="font13">(Conf’d) He tells of three houses where he had not been able to find anyone at home in four years at normal times during the day. However, he says, through evening witnessing “those people were found and two of them were very pleasant, accepted literature and agreed to a return call,” It took him three weeks to work two territories because the people were so receptive and asked so many questions during evening witnessing. Evening witnessing will undoubtedly put you in contact with many receptive persons who are seldom, if ever, found at home during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> July is assembly month. This is an additional cause for happiness. But, here again, work is involved. Are your plans for attending ineom-</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font13">Iplete for some reason? Perhaps it will help you if you talk to your congregation servant or other mature ones in the congregation and ask for suggestions. But, by all means, attend an assembly! While it will probably mean you will now need to work fast and hard, be assured that Jehovah will bless those efforts and will crown them with joy. It is true that we are happy simply because we are Jehovah’s people, but that happiness is enhanced by being </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font13"> his people. And especially at large spiritual banquets.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> After rejoicing in serving Jehovah in some way during July, there will then be the matter of reporting. Vacations and assemblies require planning as to reporting. Why not report before you leave and take along an addressed and stamped envelope so you can send your final report back home. Our service is really not complete until our report is with the home congregation.—Ezek. 9:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> This world is increasingly becoming an unhappy place in which to live. Few people find happiness in their work. What a contrast true Christians will be during July and, in fact, at all times, as they allow their minds to dwell on the simple •fact that happiness comes from being Jehovah<sup>f</sup>s people and is heightened by being busy in his work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Really, we did very well, brothers! Considering: the outstanding report we had in April, the report for May was a fitting complement. It is wonderful to know we placed 735,544 bound books in May, as this is an outstanding number for any one month. Think of the potential Bible studies from all of these placements and the pleasure we will have in directing humble ones to the way that leads to life. Aiding us to enjoy such splendid activity during May were 18,935 full-time praisers of Jehovah, including 5,973 vacation pioneers. Doesn’t it make you rejoice to be a part of such a. zealous and hardworking group of people devoted to the only worthwhile pursuit in life in these critical times? We know that it does, and we rejoice with you!</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Barrier of Fear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Have you noticed that in some areas it is becoming more difficult to talk to people because they are fearful of strangers? This is not necessarily because we are Jehovah’s witnesses. They hesitate to open the door for anyone they do not know. What will help in these cases?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It will help if we appreciate that they have good reason to be cautious. We ourselves are more Careful as violence and lawlessness increase. So, sometimes you may wish to acknowledge this when you have the opportunity to speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In homes where there are windows and the householder can plainly view you approaching and standing on the porch, your deportment, dress and bearing can help to identify you as one who need not be feared. All, young and old alike, should consistently deport themselves as Christian ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> If the barrier of fear exists even though the door is opened, what might your opening words be? It is usually best to identify yourself and your purpose immediately. One brother tells us he has had success in saying: “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, you know, a minister associated with the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. As you probably know, our purpose is to do good, not harm. In fact, I would appreciate your opinion on that very problem. Do you believe that there will ever come a time when you won’t have to fear when a stranger rings your doorbell?&quot; No matter what the response, God's purpose to bring in righteous conditions can be discussed. In doing so we can respect their right to keep the door otdy partially open, the burglar chain attached or the screen door hasped. In fact, when the problem of fear is handled with empathy, it can often be turned to our advantage. We can show that the very existence of such fear is one of the evidences we are living in the “last days.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Some have said that two brothers standing at the door make a householder, especially a lone woman, hesitate to open the door. A brother and his wife calling together, or an adult with a child, .often get a hearing ear more readily.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup>But what about working in apartment buildings where there are no windows, only small peepholes? Admittedly, this is usually a greater obstacle. To be evasive, or just repeat your name when asked, “Who’s there?” often makes the householder more suspicious. After ringing the doorbell it is best to stand back from the door, thus indicating you do not have in mind gaining entrance. Try to stand in the light and in front of the peephole so you can- be clearly seen, even though you cannot see the householder. Identify yourself and your purpose and ask if it is convenient. to speak briefly. If the door is not opened, some brothers hold the magazines up so they can be seen through the peephole, and make a brief presentation. Sometimes the door opens just enough to receive the magazines and make the contribution. It is true that some refuse to respond, but we have given them the opportunity to hear the good news, and the responsibility now rests with them. Tracts or handbills can be slipped under the door with the invitation to read them. You might slip the Bible Study folder under the door, as some publishers have done, suggesting that it be read while yo.u wait. Ask if they want the book recommended there. In some instances you might decide that an older magazine can be left. Later you could call to see if it was enjoyed. Mature publishers find joy in witnessing even under such conditions. Preparation is essential. Appreciate that the obstacle is there and work out effective ways of getting the message through.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Jesus said this good news of the Kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations. While there are barriers, often, with forethought, much can be done to overcome these. We can be sure Jehovah will bless our diligent efforts to cope with the barrier of fear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">- Undoubtedly you are acquainted with someone who was with us for a time and then for some reason or another stopped associating. Maybe he was young.

Maybe he was a parent The burden of raising a family, working long hours to provide material necessities, became too heavy. Maybe he moved. Getting settled in a new locality took too long and it became easy to stay away. Maybe he did something wrong and his conscience is plaguing iiitts.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Why not call on him and talk to him? Show him the article and read it with him. If you act quickly, you can likely get to him before the assembly.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Loving Concern</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Regarding one who is now a servant in another congregation an assistant congregation servant said, “After first placing- literature with him, I had to make eleven calls before finding him at home.” Why such persistence? It was not just persistence. It was loving concern. The man had shown a small measure of interest and now there was the possibility of getting him on the road to everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The back-call work gives us many opportunities to demonstrate this loving concern. This field of the ministry, fitting between the house-to-house work and the Bible study work, deserves our serious attention. There is evidence that publishers find a great deal of interest in the house-to-house work that is never developed. It is like a farmer who continually plants but never cultivates. A comparison of the large amount of literature placed in some congregations, with the small number of back-calls reported, makes it clear that many of us are not following through to develop that initial interest into regular home Bible studies. Why is this so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers feel incapable. They believe that making a back-call requires a great deal more than just giving a simple sermon at the door and presenting the literature. Also, they are afraid that questions will be raised that they will be unable to answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Those feeling this way should remember that the householder did show interest in the truth and thus was favorably inclined. We should optimistically expect a friendly reception. Having in mind the subject in which he was interested will allow us to prepare additional information. Then, too, if other questions come up. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure&quot;</span><span class="font13"> can be of help, or we can say we will be glad to search out the answer and come again. We can also take with us an experienced publisher who has been successful in turning back-calls into home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Additionally, good use of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book will make the back-call</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">ter acquainted with it, thus able to use it skillfully under various circumstances. One brother who had been assigned to give one of the public talks in the series based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book last fall was helped to appreciate this a short time later on a back-call. His talk had included materia! from chapter fourteen, “How to Identify the True Religion.&quot; To the interested lady he said: “Let’s see, this chapter lists five points that will help you identify the true religion. I remember they were written in italics. You look in this copy of the book and I’ll use this one. The first one appears on page 123 and after reading this one we can find the others together. Anyone acquainted with these five identifying marks of the true religion can apply them to any religion in order to test it.” This is just one example of how the material in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book can be used to make the back-call work easy and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Your back-calls will be successful when the householder begins to develop confidence and trust in you. This can be accomplished by (1) your genuine interest in him, by (2) the truths you help him understand and by (3) your reliability. Let us enlarge further on these three thoughts. The reason he is somewhat interested in the truth is very likely because he has some righteous inclinations. Thus he responds when you show unselfish concern about his eternal welfare. The Scriptural truths you teach draw him closer to Jehovah and thus a common bond begins to develop. Keeping your appointments shows you to be truly reliable and wins his respect. His gaining confidence and trust in you will increase his interest in the God you worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">' The brother mentioned in our opening paragraph called ,back eleven times before he contacted the interested person. What a blessing now to realize that that person has progressed so as to be used on the servant body! We, too, will enjoy many blessings in the back-call work as we show persistence and</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• Is it all right to buy a church building for use as a Kingdom Hall or, when a new Kingdom Hall is built, to sell the former hall for use as a church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is a matter for the brothers locally to decide. There does not appear to be any direct Scriptural objection to doing so. It is not a matter of cooperating in a religious way with representatives of false religion, but is simply a business transaction. It is a one-time real estate deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, if some in the congregation are bothered in conscience because of such buying or selling, then this can be taken into consideration so as not to stumble anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Renting a Kingdom Hall from a religious organization, however, requires close, constant relationship with representatives of false religion. There is a month-to-month contact in paying the rent and in the discussions regarding repairs and upkeep. Also, renting from a false religious organization might indicate to onlookers that there is not the distinct difference between the truth and false religion that we claim there is. It is best to avoid such rental arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is up to the brothers locally to decide if they should rent a pool from a false religious organization on a one-time basis for an assembly baptism. The same is true of renting an auditorium for an assembly. It is best to make other arrangements, if possible.</span></p>

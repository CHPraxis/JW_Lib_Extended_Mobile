<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.&quot;—Luke 21:28.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">‘^Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These days good news is coming to us from all sides. Recently the annual report was completed, and when you get the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> you will enjoy the reports of expansion throughout the world during the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What about the new service year? It is starting oft with reports from many parts of the world showing more fine increases. The British Isles had a new peak of 58,571, Australia reported a peak of 20,868, Korea’s peak was 10,831, Ghana reported 12,876 for the first time, Argentina reached 16,6S9, the Netherlands had 17.487 and Italy 15,750. Some of the other countries reporting new peaks in the first month of the service year were Togo, Dominican Republic, Japan, Lebanon, Burma, Kenya, Colombia. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Venezuela, Belgium, Puerto Rico and Sierra Leone, and not all the reports are in yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Reports are beginning to come in too from the assemblies in the Pacific area. The assembly in Seoul, Korea, showed evidence of the increase in that land. 1,511 were baptized, and this represents about 15 percent of the publishers in Korea. The brothers rejoiced to receive the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font12"> in the Korean language. At the public meeting the attendance rose to 14,644.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In -Tapan too there was great rejoicing. There was an all-time record crowd of 12,614 at the public lecture, packing three grandstands and overflowing. 70S new brothers and sisters were baptized, and the expansion continues in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Here in Brooklyn all of us were excited to learn that 150,905 new brothers and sisters were baptized during the past service year all around the world, and we have looked for indications as to what progress will be made in the new service year. We have found some interesting figures in connection with the reports from the circuit</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Faith Builders at Work</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> If ever there was a need for faith building it is now. It makes one sorry to see so many people, young and old, with no faith in God and no hope for the future. Expectations built up by the false promises of secular and religious leaders have been postponed so many times that the hearts of the people in general are sick. But as tlie apostle Paul explained, “faith is not a possession of all people.” It is, though, of Jehovah's Christian witnesses. We have confidence in the sure promises of the Word of God.—2 The-ss. 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- Knowing as we do that “without faith” we cannot be well-pleasing assemblies for September. In 1967 in the month of September circuit assemblies reported 1,329 immersed. In September 1968 there were 1,612 immersed. In contrast, the report for September 1969 showed 3,366 baptized, and this only two months after the large international assemblies in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are very thankful to Jehovah that he is giving such increases and gathering in so many sheeplike persons in these “last days.” We are impressed too with our responsibilities in connection with these newly dedicated brothers and sisters. We desire to see them continuing with us side by side in the service of Jehovah in the years ahead. So it will he good for each individual publisher throughout the country to have in mind the spiritual needs of these new ones and encourage them in every way. By serving Jehovah together we will surely see many more blessings from Jehovah. We hope there will be a large number of new publishers joining with us in the service during December and on into 1970. Indeed, we have good reasons to hold our heads up high as we see our deliverance drawing near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brothers, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font12">to God and tiiat lives are at stake, we have strong reasons to want to build faith in others. (Hob. 11:6) Our literature offer for December is the .Yem World </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> and the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is the, Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font12"> for .$1.25. What marvelous instruments these are in our hands to work at faith building! How grateful we can be to Jehovah and his organization for making these available for our use! If yon run out of the Word </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of God</span><span class="font12"> hook, you may offer the Bible with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font12">or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Erol lit ion</span><span class="font12"> book. Which offer we will make depends on what books are on hand and the needs of the people to whom we are talking. But in each case we want to highlight the Bible, for we all know that reading and studying tlie Word of God is what really builds faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup>A congregation servant recently asked those nt a service meeting how they had been helped to develop faith in God's Word. Agreement was unanimous that it was by means of a home Bible study that someone had patiently conducted with them. Isn’t, it true, that 'the placing of a Bible or a book, or both, is not the end of our faith-building efforts, but only the beginning? Just as we have benefited so much from having someone study the Bible with us, so we will want to return promptly to those with whom literature was placed, making at least one offer to them to have a home Bible study,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Even though there are no questions in the Hord </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of God</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> books, studies can be conducted in these books if that is the information the householder needs. You might want to make up your own questions, or just discuss portions of tlie book with the interested person, Consider this suggestion: Read together all the paragraphs under a given subheading and then ask a question or two. Do the same with the next subheading.

<p><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Mention num-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You are free to use any presentation with which you get good results, but we suggest that you try the one outlined below. It is urgent for people to see the difference between true religion and the false, and it is our privilege to help them. It may surprise you to find out how freely many people will talk about current church practices with which they disagree. When invited to express themselves, some will openly tell you that they are fed up with the churches and no longer attend but that they do believe in God. Obviously, comments such as these help you to know how to aid the householder. So, in using the following sermon, we suggest that, at the outset, you invite the householder to express himself. After hearing his comments, rather than taking issue with points that may be wrong, try to find out one on which you agree; emphasize it, and then direct his attention to the scriptures. Try it. We believe that you will have good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Finding the True Religion Suggested introduction: &quot;Helio. My name is ---. I am one of Jehovah’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">witnesses. You have probably read the news reports showing that much religion today seems to be confused. Many people do not know what to believe. Why do you think this situation exists? [Allow for comment, acknowledging; find a point of agreement where possible.] Have you ever looked at it this way? ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2 Tim. 4:3, 4—Some do not want the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">John 4:23—One’s religion, to please God, must conform to truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The Bible shows that God is soon going to destroy false religion, but he will bless with eternal life those who worship him in accord with the truth. So it is vital that we make sure that our worship is in full harmony with God’s Word of truth, the Bible.” Tie in with current “Watchtower.’’</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Splendid Provisions to Build and Strengthen Faith</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Y</span><span class="font13">OU have already given heartfelt thanks to God for the new book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?,</span><span class="font13"> haven’t you? A brother from Ohio wrote: “I want to thank you especially for it. It is a magnificent compendium of valuable information!” And a sister from Chicago exclaimed: “Truly Jehovah has blessed us with another fine Bible-study aid!” We can all agree, can’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Remember how you felt at the assembly this summer when this new book was released. How thrilling it was to hear of its contents and then later to look through the book, taking note of the chapters! Why, the assembly even demonstrated how extremely useful it will be in our ministry. We can readily agree that it is a splendid provision, can’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Likely even before you completed reading the book, you placed a copy with someone, knowing that the book would be “just right” for that type of person. Have you by now finished a personal reading of the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font13"> If not, would you like some assistance in going through it? For those who have read it, would you like a quick but thorough review of its contents, a review that highlights how certain material in it can be used in preaching to others? Another splendid provision is being made so that you can do just that. Beginning in January, this book will be covered completely at your congregation by means of six public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">You Will Be Helped!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As Christian witnesses of Jehovah we already have faith in God and in His Word, don’t we? Like the Thessalonian believers, we view the Bible, “not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God.” (1 Thess. 2:13) Yet, the apostle Paul wrote to those same believers that their ‘faith was </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">growing</span><span class="font13"> exceedingly.’ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font13"> Thess. 1:3) Our faith can grow too. It can be strengthened. These talks will help our faith to grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even though you have good reason to accept the Bible as the Word of God, there may be certain questions you have heard others ask. For instance: Where did the water go that covered the earth in Noah’s day? Could the sun and moon really have stood still in Joshua’s time? How could a merciful God destroy children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You may have a general idea as to the Scriptural answers to these questions. But would not a detailed and satisfying discussion of these matters help to strengthen your faith and better equip you to aid others? The six public talks based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font13"> book will greatly aid you in this regard. These and many other points will be considered in a balanced and refreshing way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Be sure to listen for the announcement in your congregation as to when the talks based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font13"> book will be delivered. At most Kingdom Halls it will be the first two Sundays in each of the months January, February and March. Bring your copy of the book to those talks. Then, as the speaker covers the points and draws attention to specific material in the book, you can follow along and become even more acquainted with this new provision. He may arrange ahead of time for you to read certain quotations from the book, or you may be able to answer questions that are directed to the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The six talks will work progressively through the book. For instance, the first two talks will each cover three chapters, and the succeeding four, two chapters each. Thus, you can completely cover the book. As you see points that will be useful to you in witnessing to others, you can note them in the margin or underline them. And the presentations will be designed to focus on the key ideas in the book and the way in which specific information can be used in the ministry. There will be questions to and from the audience, demonstrations, panels and other interesting methods used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It would be good if, ahead of time, you could arrange a schedule to read the chapters to be covered. That way you will be able to concentrate on how the material can be put to use. Remember that it is quite likely that members of the audience will be sharing in the talks. Yet, even if sometime you are not able to review the chapters before the meeting, do not fail to be there to benefit from the stimulating presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Sure to Invite—</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How would you complete the encouragement, “Be sure to invite . . . ”? Who do you feel should be in attendance with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The apostle Paul spoke about some in his day who “had no hope and were without God in the world.” (Eph. 2:12) Don’t you have some acquaintances or relatives who fit that description? In this time when the faith of many has diminished or died, what a fine thing it is to have a special program designed to consider material that should help individuals to build or strengthen faith. Really, a careful consideration of the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font13"> should do just that, should it not? All too often persons have let higher criticism or general skepticism cause them to lose faith in God and in his Word. A fair and intelligent consideration of some of the major stumbling blocks ought to aid such ones to see that there is real reason for faith, and that they can believe the Bible to be the Word of God. How vital this is, since without faith it is impossible to please Jehovah.—Heb. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Think of those around you. Does your marriage mate have deep faith in God and trust in the Bible as the Word of God? What about your neighbors or relatives who are in high school or college? Don’t you think that if you enthusiastically talked up and invited them to hear a talk such as “Bible Accounts of Creation and Flood—Fact or Fiction ?” they would attend ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How about the home Bible study you conduct? Are other members of the household skeptical or weak in faith? Does the husband feel that God’s Word is outdated or of no concern to him? Why not invite him to hear talks such as “Bible Prophecies Involve Your Life” and “Practical Counsel Provided by God for Man.” Have you met persons in your territory who do not believe in the Bible because they are not even nominal Christians, perhaps coming from a land where paganism prevails? Make an extraordinary effort to invite these to attend the entire series of talks. Stress that the same talks are being given in every congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States. You can assure persons who in the past have attended the public talks only sporadically that these will be talks they should not miss; they definitely are ones that they have never heard before. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Truly the arrangement to have these talks is a splendid provision to build and strengthen faith. Reflect your conviction of that with enthusiasm. Be determined to invite others, to be there yourself and to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggestions for You Speakers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Last year we had a series of special meetings designed to cover the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book. The response from the brothers and from interested persons was overwhelming. Among other things, that reflects very favorably on you brothers who worked hard to prepare and deliver those talks. Now you face a challenge that, if successfully met, will result in another real blessing to those who attend and a great shout of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The present talks are based directly on the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font13"> There is no need to do research to locate additional material. You will have more than enough in the assigned chapters. One of the basic purposes of these talks is to help the brothers to become familiar with the book. You will make a real contribution to that end if you develop the assigned material in the order it is presented in the book. Be sure to refer to the book and to direct the attention of the audience to specific paragraphs or quotations. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">We want you to do that!</span><span class="font13"> In that way they will become acquainted with the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You will, of course, need to familiarize yourself thoroughly with all the material in the chapters assigned to you. Study carefully the appropriate outline that follows. Fix in mind the main points and stress them. Thus, even if some in the audience forget certain details, they will be able to see the key points. Perhaps you can list these on a chart or blackboard. Repeat them as often as seems to be practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In handling scriptures, you can read them yourself, or have publishers in the audience who &quot;have been notified ahead of time read them. Involve the audience, as you are able to do so. Make the talk memorable and informative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Keep in mind those who are there for the first time and who may not yet have concluded that the Bible really is the Word of God. Speak logically. Be enthusiastic and yet show that there is good reason for what you are saying. Be convinced and convincing. Help these new ones to see the main ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the outlines are recommendations that, if followed, will add variety to the talks. Whenever possible, try to incorporate them. Even in smaller congregations some variety can be obtained if effort is put forth. If there will be a symposium, those involved should get together beforehand to work out the details. Demonstrations will help to make your part interesting and of practical value, but they ought to be thoroughly rehearsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Have your copy of the book Is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font13"> on the platform with you. Refer to it frequently. When you do so, every time announce clearly the page you are considering. You will not be able to cover every paragraph in detail, but the brothers who are following along in their books should be able to see that you are progressively covering the assigned material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your assignment is a challenge. This is new material and the way it is to be delivered also may be new to you. Work at it. Be prepared. By your confident presentation help the brothers to appreciate what a splendid provision this new book is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The following suggestions are specifically for the assigned speakers, but all may read them, for they will whet your appetite for what is to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">May be handled by two speakers. No chairman needed to introduce program on this particular occasion, but a chairman should conclude the program. First speaker begins, covering chapter one, then introduces second speaker who handles next chapter. First speaker returns and presents chapter three.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 1: (10 min.) Welcome audience to series of talks bearing on question, Is the Bible really the Word of God? Material drawn from book (show audience). Significant question because some people ask questions such as (page 5). Their questions lead to, Why examine the Bible? There are at least seven sound reasons for investigating it. Invite audience to count them (each of first seven paragraphs from pages 6-9). Welcome audience to put Bible to the test. Opening account of Bible is about creation. Is it reasonable to accept it as fact?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 2: (30 min.) People beginning to read Bible often view Genesis account of creation as impossible fiction. Careful consideration of it gives real reason for viewing it as fact. Main points to emphasize: (1) Creation account not based on myths. Compare Babylonian myth with Bible. Mention shape of earth. Read Job 26:7, (2) Bible gives reasonable explanation of origin of universe. Read one quote on uncertainty of scientific theories. Belief in theories requires faith.. Lse quote on page 17. Only Bible answers question as to source of energy. Read or quote Isaiah 40:26. (3) Order of creation given in God’s Word is reliable. ' [May list events of six days on blackboard.] Very brief comments on length of creative days. Show uncertainty of scientific knowledge about earth's early history. Deal with problem of apparent contradiction between Day 1 and Day 4, reading Genesis 1:3-5, 14, 16, 19. Consider problem of vegetation growing and surviving during “third day.&quot; [Both problems may be posed from audience.] Only brief comments about record of rocks. Cover uncertainty of dating methods, using one quotation. In connection with Day 6, explain logic of Bible’s description of origin of races. Use one quote from page 30. Recapitulate, pointing out science does not have all answers, and faith is needed to accept scientific theories. Bible information is reasonable and reliable. (4) No halfway acceptance of creation account possible. Tie in Matthew 19:4-6. Evident that there are good reasons to accept Bible account of creation as fact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 3: (15 min.) Quickly describe Flood, since some may not have details in mind. Raise objection that Flood was only local, and reason on point. Mention that some charge that the account is fiction because of what is said about the source and disposition of water. Lightly touch on source of water. Read Genesis 7:17-20 and discuss how this could have occurred. Use quotes on pages 37 and 38. Harmonizes with indications of ancient climate and vast destruction in past. Mention Flood traditions, giving gist of quotation but not reading. Read Genesis 6:20 and develop paragraph 4 on page 42. Summarize key points: (1) Global Hood possible according to scientific discoveries. (2) Widespread Flood traditions indicate Flood did actually occur. (3) All animal “kinds'' could reasonably have been preserved through Flood. Stress that ive need not explain Flood according to mechanical or scientific theories to accept it. Have ample confirmation in that Jesus and apostles believed It. Conclude talk commenting that results or Investigation of these two areas illuminate Bible as fact and not fiction. Perhaps other areas are of concern, such as whether Bible harmonizes with historv. how miracles could have occurred or whether Bible is consistent. Succeeding talks will deal with these matters.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Chairman may announce that speaker will have panel of two or three who will supply historical information bearing on subject.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 4: (25 min.) Bible not dependent on secular history. It is a history in itself, older and more reliable than others. But to be truth, it must be truthful on historical matters also. Worthwhile to compare Bible with accurate secular history to see whether they agree. Are numerous points of harmony. Use Isaiah 20:1. Refer to examples in account of Joseph. Personally read first quote on page 47. Raise objection that Bible Is not completely harmonious with history. Calling upon one of panel to read portion of it, illustrate with “King List” why it need not be. Demonstrate harmony by reading Genesis 11:8, 9 and asking for one quote supporting this. Not all ancient historians can be relied upon. Support by a quotation. Gould have question from audience as to reliability of ancient inscriptions. Use Exodus 12:12 and speak about Egypt. Then comment briefly on Assyria or Babylon, requesting one quotation. Show that differences need not cause concern, by discussing Sennacherib. Comment briefly on chronological history. Ask for quote on page 5S to be read. Review main points: (1) Are numerous points of harmony between Bible and ancient history. (2) Historical records must be evaluated, not viewed as always totally correct. (3) Differences between Bible and other ancient history are not cause for concern. Conclude with observations on Bible's honesty and preservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 5: (18 min.) May announce that in audience certain ones have asked questions they would like considered. Begin by commenting on the truthfulness of the record in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Bring in 1 Thessalonians 2:13 and first quotation on page 63. Ask for the questions. (1) With so many modern books claiming that the Gospel picture of Jesus is deceptive, how can it be established that comments about Jesus in the Greek Scriptures are accurate? Use quote from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Annals</span><span class="font11"> on page 63, and quotation on page 64. Explain why we should not expect secular comments praising Jesus. References were by opposers. (2) How can it be established that the Greek Scriptures are accurate records, presenting historical fact'.’ Read and reason on Luke 3:1. 2. Same accuracy in detail in other books of Greek Scriptures. Call for quote from F. F. Bruce, on page 67. Illustrate with brief reference to Acts 13:7. Speak about type of men used to write Greek Scriptures. (3) If record is sound, presenting historical facts, why do many reject it? Many do, including clergymen, because their wav of life is condemned bv it. For some, the price of acceptance is too high; the problem is with their hearts. Review key points. (1) Gospel accounts about Jesus are worthy of acceptance. (2) There are many evidences of reliability in Greek Scriptures. (3) Reasons why Bible Is rejected by many should move us to search our hearts. Conclude with comments as to the value of examining the historical facts in the Greek Scripture record. Bring in John 20:31. Urge audience to read Greek Scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 6: (12 min.) May be delivered as normal talk. Some reading Bible are willing to accept historical comments about men or events but find miracles recorded in Bible difficult to believe. Should not say that miracles are impossible. Use quote on page 75. Emphasize God's power, paraphrasing Romans 1:20, Illustrate with Joshua’s experience and floating axheaci. Is widespread disbelief in virgin birth. That God could do this is just as possible as creating a living person or transmitting life. Scientists have yet much to learn. Miracles in Bible occurred for good reasons. Tie Jesus’ healings in with Revelation 21:4 and our hope for future. That we did not see Jesus' miracles is no reason to deny that they are historical fact. Bible contains strongest evidence of miracles. Reasonable to expect that miracles give us indication as to God's will for future. Summarize entire talk by going over points reviewed in first and second section, then commenting that miracles of Bible are not contrarv to true science and they give us assurance for future. Invite all to study Bible promises with Jehovah's witnesses regularly.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>3. The Bible—Contradictory or Consistent?</span></h6></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">May be delivered by one or two speakers. Have panel of brothers and sisters on platform or in front row of audience to pose problems speaker or speakers will solve.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 7: (20 min.) Some claim Bible does not have their confidence because it is not even consistent within itself. Certain ones making such claims may not personally have ever read Bible: are parroting others. Yet, for sake of those who sincerely believe that Bible is inconsistent, worthwhile to consider some of problems. Panel prepared to raise such. (1) Parallel accounts in Matthew and John seem contradictory as to who asked Jesus about a special privilege. Have questioner read accounts in Matthew 20:20. 21 and Mark 10:35-37. When explaining bring in quotation from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font11"> and Matthew 20:24. Illustrates that different viewpoints of same event can seem to differ. (2) Accounts of Jesus' healing on one occasion appear to differ as to number and location. (Read or paraphrase appropriate texts as time determined by rehearsal allows.] Bring in quotation on page 86. Make point that this establishes that viewpoint of writer and background information can clear up apparent discrepancies. (3) John 1:18 says no man has seen God at any- time, but Exodus 24:9, 10 seems to contradict that. [Have questioner read Exodus 24:9, 10.] Explain that context solves problem, using Exodus 24:11. Then explain that similar reasoning helps us to understand differences in the two genealogies of Jesus presented in Matthew and Luke (do not develop this point] and the problem of where Cain got a wife. Explain briefly about Cain and paraphrase Genesis 5:4. Conclude that we have seen what seemed to be contradictions clarified bv recognizing (1) that different writers mar take different viewpoints. (2) that background knowledge dispels apparent contradictions and (3) that context often bears on such matters. That such apparent problems exist actually Is to credit of Bible because it shows there was no collusion among writers, that the record has not been &quot;doctored up.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 8: (35 min.) Some persons claim that more serious apparent inconsistencies in Bible relate to its moral standards, even though Bible would appear to be of superior moral quality in that It has laws going far beyond human laws. Will consider typical objections as raised by panel. (1) How can Bible be viewed as presenting a moral code from God and yet tell about Noah’s drunkenness and its result? Briefly relate or have related Genesis 9:20-27. Explain, stressing Proverbs 20:1. Comment on how such frankness in Bible should impress us. weaving in quote on page 92. Discuss that God's thinking is higher than ours, and read Ezekiel 18:29, 30. (2) Some charge that a moral God would never have called for execution of Canaanites. Including young children. Give gist of Deuteronomy 9:5. Mention wickedness brought out in Leviticus 18, including incest, sodomy and bestiality; finally reading 18:27. Bring in first paragraph of quotation on page 94. God’s dealings show he is not quick to destroy imperfect people. Deal with matter of children, reading Deuteronomy 30:19, 20. Emphasize points in last paragraph on page 96 and paragraph 1 on page 97. Show there is something for parents today to learn from this example. (3) Some feel there is an inconsistency in Bible because Mosaic law involved &quot;eye for eye&quot; or retaliation, whereas Christianity stresses forgiveness. But Mosaic law did not encourage personal vengeance, as seen from Romans 12:19. Christians likewise must not &quot;avenge themselves.” Jehovah himself adhered to principle 'soul for soul.’ Illustrate by giving gist of Romans 5:12 and 1 Timothy 2:5. God has remained the same, although what he may require of us can change as his purpose progresses. Hebrew Scriptures talk about warfare but also point forward to “Prince of Peace.&quot; Christian Greek Scriptures stress peacefulness but also coming war when wickedness will be eliminated. Review key points: (1) Bible contains accounts of wrong conduct that serve as warning examples. (2) We need to view God's dealings from his standpoint, not from imperfect, emotional human standpoint. (3) His standard of moralitv has remained consistently high. Conclude showing that our response to what we read in Bible can reveal what is in our heart and affect our eternal life. Must examine Bible’s moral standards carefully and learn from Scriptures. Can be thankful Bible sets out requirements for those who would please God. Use Micah 6:8 and gist of Joshua 24:15. Encourage audience to keep in mind as they read Bible that it is not contradictory and that moral lessons in it are important for our eternal welfare.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>4. Bible Prophecies Involve Your Life</span></h6></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">May be presented by one or two speakers. Well-rehearsed demonstrations will be a key to talk's effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 9: (35 min.) Opening words can be reading Isaiah 46:10. Explain this means God’s ability to foretell future. Often said he did so through Hebrew prophets, who were different from other ancient prophets. Use quotation on page 103. Some object, saying Bible prophecies are simply clever predictions or history disguised as prophecy. Since our lives are involved in truthfulness and accuracy of Bible prophecies, worthy- of careful consideration. Use as example prophecy about Jerusalem’s destruction. Refer to Jeremiah 25:1, 2 and read verses 8-11. Explain how it was fulfilled and read quote from W. F. Albright on page 105. Relate prophecies about Babylon and fulfillment. Refer to Herodotus but do not read. Mention Xenophon, More startling prophecy involves Alexander the Great of Greece. Read Daniel 8:1. 8. No question of interpreting or twisting application; Bible itself provides explanation. Read Daniel 8:20-22. Comment on fulfillment. Mention again charge that Bible prophecy is history disguised as prophecy. Critics who charge this can give no logical or reasonable motives for this having been done. To contrary, there is reason to conclude that priests who possessed parts of Bible did not make adjustments. Some Bible prophecies would have seemed improbable. such as the permanent destruction of Babylon. Bible prophecies are not scanty; some are most detailed, especially prophecies regarding Jesus. Information about Bible prophecies can be useful in showing others that Bible really is Word of God. As a demonstration of how this can bo done using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font11"> book, note following demonstration: Brother and sister visiting young couple on back-call. Brother refers to importance of our time because of Bible prophecies pinpointing It. Man objects; views &quot;prophecies&quot; in Bible to be simply good guesses. Brother is understanding. Refers to prophecies in Daniel, covering pages 108 and 109 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font11"> book. Man acknowledges what actually occurred with Alexander. Wonders whether prophecy might have been written after events took place. Brother uses thoughts on pages 110 and 111. He stresses that some prophecies would have been improbable. Reads Isaiah 13:19, 20. Shows quote from A. Parrot on page 112. Points out chart on pages 114 and 115. Reads quote on page 114. Says Jesus established himself as a prophet by foretelling destruction of Jerusalem. Conversation trails off. Speaker begins again, Jesus was greatest prophet of all. Read and paraphrase Luke 19:41-44; 21:20-24. Explain why this could not have been written after destruction of Jerusalem. Bring in fulfillment and quotation on page 120. Conclude, stressing prophecies in Bible do not deai with Just past events, also relate to our time and our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 10: (20 min.) [Keep in mind during this section that the major point is not to prove that we are living in &quot;last days&quot; but that prophecies that have been fulfilled serve as a proof that Bible is Word of God.] For some people to believe Bible to be God's Word, want to see that it relates directly to their personal life and experience. Bible definitely does this: its prophecies are being fulfilled in this generation. Brief reference to Matthew 24 and Luke 21, then raise objection in paragraph 3 on page 121. Revelation shows would be future fulfillment. Read Revelation 6:3, 4. Bring in quote from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World War I,</span><span class="font11"> on page 123. Use facts in quote on page 124, but do not read. Quote Matthew 24:7 and have first quote on page 125 from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> read. Emphasize that point of considering this is to see whether Bible prophecies involve our life and so whether the Bible is Word of God. Refer to Revelation 6:7. 8 and Luke 21:11, but do not read. Use quote on page' 126. Ask questions found near top of page 127. Look up and read Luke 21:10, 11, stressing earthquakes. Give brief gist of statistics about earthquakes. Onlv lightlv cover pages 129 and 130. Some say increase in crime just means better reporting. Focus attention on quotation on page 131 Involving J. E. Hoover. Attitude toward fellowmen has changed. This general information can be quite useful in stimulating in others interest in knowing whether Bible is really Word of God. Introduce brief demonstration: Publisher doing house-to-house work meets householder who thinks Witnesses take Bible too literally. Feels Bible contains some good moral principles but so do other religious books. Publisher acknowledges, but stresses this involves whether Bible is really Word of God. Other religious books do not contain prophecy that we can see being fulfilled. Shows householder page 123 and reads Revelation 6:3, 4. Calls attention to quote from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font11"> War </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">I.</span><span class="font11"> Uses Matthew 24:7 on page 124 and final quote on page 125. Very briefly refers to information on pages 126-128 but not going into detail. Reasons nicelv on material under heading &quot;All to Be Fulfilled In This Generation.&quot; Comments that if these prophecies are actually being fulfilled it supports view that Bible is Word of God. Offers householder opportunity to look into matter more carefully by reading book. Speaker concludes talk with information on page 134 and encouragement, to lift up heads because of what lies ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Chapter 11: (30 min.) Before or during talk list on blackboard as main points of first half of talk five subheadings on pages 136-144, Many feel the Bible is outdated, that It was written by ancients and that precepts in it are no longer applicable. If Bible truly is word of God, then, in accord with Psalm 119:105, it would present practical counsel for our day. In at least five areas this proves to be so. (1) Draw upon 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12. Show how Bible would benefit a person as to gambling, smoking, drunkenness. Give gist of Proverbs 23:29, 30. Bible will not solve al! economic problems at present, but it is definitely of real help. (2) Read Proverbs 14:30 from book and direct attention to quote on page 138. Paraphrase Ephesians 4:31, 32. Bible enables one to make a change by providing healthful food for heart. Give idea of Proverbs 7:5, 22-27 and gist of first quotation on page 139. Have discussed both mental and. physical health. (3) Read second quote on page 139. Without reading it. mention point of Proverbs 5:3-11, 18. Read Hebrews 13:4. (4) Onlv deal with this section (A Happy Homelife) lightly. (5) Bring in Proverbs 16:32 and material in paragraph where it is found. Do not use paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 145. Develop reasoning in paragraph 2 on page 146. Introduce demonstration involving brother who is visiting husband and wife: wife studies but husband is not interested. He comments that he does not care If wife studies, but thinks this is something for women. Brother acknowledges view: mentions that many men fee) Bible is impractical for our time. Explains that he found of interest five points developed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font11"> book. He rapidly calls attention to points 1. 2 and 3. Stresses point 4. using quotation on page 142 and Ephesians 5:28-33. Explains to man practical benefits for his own family, as developed in final paragraph on page 143, extending over on 144. Mentions point 5 and develops paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 145. Husband seems a bit more interested. Brother uses second quotation on page 148, then pulls out </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book and begins to comment about chapter 20. Speaker resumes. There is living proof of Bible's practicality. Use quote on page 147 from Italian magazine. Urge audience to apply Bible personally. That serves as proof that it really is Word of God. Conclude section, using 1 Thessalonians 2:13, stressing final phrase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">Chapter 12: (25 min.) Have for a number of weeks considered Information establishing that Bible is Word of God. Logical questions remain How was it inspired and how did it come down to us? Quote 2 Timothy 3:16. Look up 2 Samuel 23:2. Mention different ways Bible writers received God’s Word. Do not use paragraph 2 on page 152 or paragraph 1 on page 153. Speak about harmony and how this supports inspiration. Discuss arrangement of books in Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. Both parts are necessary. Use Deuteronomy 17:18 to illustrate that copying Bible is not wrong. Do not use paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 156, extending over on 157. Modern Bibles arc quite reliable: direct attention to quote on page 157 and second quote on page 158. Later translations have improvements. Use 1 John 5:7, 8. Introduce young brother who will demonstrate, as if speaking to class in school, how such information can be useful in talking to others about Bible: He comes to platform and explains English word &quot;Bible.” Raises question whether Bible we have is reliable. Briefly comments on inspiration and develops paragraph 2 on page 152 and paragraph 1 on page 153. Asks whether Bible has come down to us in an accurate form. Develops paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 156.

<p><span class="font11">Chapter 13: (35 min.) Bible frequently viewed as represented by Christendom. Because of past course of nations of Christendom, creates question of whether Christendom represents Bible. Actually Bible not much read in Christendom. Use quote about Protestantism on page 163 and Catholic quote on 164, Religious leaders themselves often do not believe Bible: in effect they represent God as being mute. Contributes to &quot;God is dead&quot; outlook. Leaders of Christendom do not uphold Bible’s morality. Read 1 Corinthians 6:9. 10. Contrast this with expressed views of religious leaders, selecting quotations from pages 167 and 169. Some may feel views presented are extreme and do not represent most clergymen. Principle of Matthew 7:18 leads to conclusion that churches producing such fruitage are not of God. Use quotation on page 170 and gist of Jesus’ words in Matthew 15:1-9 and 23:27. 28. Question of motive thus arises. Often clergy preach to please hearers or view activities simply as job. Those Christian ministers who preached about Jesus In first century were undoubtedly sincere and not like many ministers of Christendom. Why, then, change from that situation to the modern one? Briefly comment on parable of wheat and weeds. Read Acts 20:29. 30 and first quote on page 174. Mention Crusades and give gist of 2 Corinthians 10:3, 4. In discussing Protestantism, bring out idea at 1 Corinthians 1:10-13. Round out section with quote on page 178 and use Titus 1:16. Review, perhaps Hating main points on blackboard. (1) Christendom basically does not use and fully believe Bible. (2) Clergy of Christendom do not believe and teach Bible morality. (3) Christendom represents foretold apostasy. Plain that Christendom's churches do not represent Bible. Their future wilt be consistent with Galatians 6:7. Wise course for individuals wanting to follow Bible is to separate from Christendom.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Ready for what? For the 32nd annual </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription campaign! Starting in January and running through April, we will be offering a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> for just one dollar, along with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a free gift of</span><span class="font12"> three booklets. Those who wish to offer both the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> subscriptions together are encouraged to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> But what do we have to do to get ready? The scripture at Romans 2 : 21 reminds us, “teach yourself.” We can do this by carefully reading through the new magazines as we receive them. It also helps to note points that you think would be of interest to those you speak to in the house-to-house ministry or on back-calls. Each issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will have a timely article that ties in nicely with the sermon “Finding the True Religion” and that will strongly appeal to persons who truly want to be pleasing to God. These can be used in your presentation. It is always more effective and interesting to show specific highlights than to talk in generalities in offering the magazines. So we want to be ready, reading the magazines before offering them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Another way we can prepare for this four-month campaign is by becoming thoroughly familiar with the sermon that has been suggested, perhaps practicing it by presenting it to someone else. Some vary the presentation they make or the sermon they use, adapting it to the territory or to those to whom they speak. This, too, is good. Finally, have you placed your order for extra magazines for use during the campaign? We do not want to run short, do we?—1 Tim. G : 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Have you noticed how the circulation of the magazines is increasing? More and more are appreciating how </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> truly helps them to find satisfying answers to the questions that are of the greatest importance in their lives. As we announce Jehovah’s kingdom with the help of this magazine, many will be aided to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. But this takes more than just receiving the magazines, does it not? So again, from the start of the campaign, let’s be ready to follow up on all interest found in an effort to start more Bible studies so that the truth will become securely implanted in the minds and hearts of those loving righteousness.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">complete arguments are covered before questions are raised. As a variation, after reading a section, ask the householder if he has any questions. The entire </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font12"> book and the material in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font12">book from Chapter 12 on particularly lend themselves to this type of discussion. Where a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book is placed, we can use the usual method of study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Are you one who has been studying with Jehovah’s witnesses for several months and is attending meetings so that you have been given this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry?</span><span class="font12"> If so, have you considered taking a part in this faith-building work yourself? December would be a fine month in which to begin. You have grown to appreciate the Bible and so can enthusiastically offer it to others. We invite you to begin this month if you qualify. Speak to the one who conducts a study with you and ask if you may go along in the preaching work. What a fine way it will be to express your appreciation for what you have learned by telling others the urgent Kingdom message. Each of us can show that our faith is alive by taking part in the preaching work.—Jas. 2 :17-2G.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> While the book of Revelation may seem difficult to understand for the people of Christendom, this need not be so for Jehovah’s people. Rather, “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy,” says Revelation 1:3. So we have good cause to be happy that arrangements were made to begin studying the Society’s new publication </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“'Then Is Finished the. Mystery of God”</span><span class="font12"> on December 1. It will be a pleasure to attend the congregation book study to grow in our understanding of the deep things of God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> As we study we will learn that those in the congregation in Laodi-cea were lukewarm, and those in Ephesus 'left the love they had at first.' These serve as timely warnings. Wisely we will be in attendance at the study of this material, in effect ‘buying the gold refined by tire so that we may become rich’ spiritually. While attendance at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study is up to 101 percent of the number of publishers, the congregation book studies are attended by 90.7 percent on the average. But these meetings are located so conveniently to all of us, could not 100 percent or even more be present as interested persons also attend? Make it a point, not only to invite your Bible students or others who need encouragement to come, but also to stop by</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN OCTOBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The best subscription month ever! Throughout the month subscriptions were pouring in to the Society; and when the reports were tallied they showed a total of 267,128 subscriptions obtained. This is 40,375 better than our previous peak month of April 1969. Individual magazine placements, too, were excellent, reaching 8,789,818, a new peak by over half a million. When you think of the benefits that can come to all who read these publications, are you not happy that you had a part in the work in October? </span><span class="font12">win want to overlook the necessity of keeping our own faith strong. Just as faith is built up in others through knowledge, so it is kept strong in this way. Thus personal and family study must be a regular part of our life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With Advance Preparation</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever been at a door giving a witness and found yourself not knowing just what to say or how to answer, objections that were raised? You walk away wishing to yourself that you had thought of other points lo mention to the householder. Wishing, though, does not provide the thoughts and words. The real answer is advance preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As an example, during the month of December we are going to be placing the Bible and the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">/■&lt; the Bible Really the</span><span class="font12"> Word </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of God?</span><span class="font12"> It is our first campaign with this new book. Have we finished reading it ourselves? Are we prepared to take advantage of its splendid material? You may have in your territory many who do not believe that the Bible is the Word of God. What will you say to them so that they will recognize the value of the Bible and obtain a copy? Before approaching such individuals it certainly would be good, would it not, to consider carefully some of the solid arguments in the Word </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of God</span><span class="font12"> book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■’ Likely some will say that they do not believe because “the Bible contradicts itself.’’ Chapter 7 answers Unit, and the examples on pages S3 and 84 can help you to establish that the Bible is consistent in what it says. Your advance preparation will allow you to show them that seeming contradictions may be misunderstandings because of not considering the context or I ho viewpoint, of the Bible writer. This publication gives strong reason for faith and confidence that the Bible is consistent and truly the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■' Preparing in advance an approach or introduction appropriate to your territory will allow yon to overcome objections before they arise. In some areas you might say, “We have talked to many people who do not believe the Bible is the Word of God. What are your thoughts on this?” If their answer is that, they do not. believe the Bible, then you could say: “Many people feel that way. However, recently I obtained a fine book that gives solid reasons for confidence in the Bible. Since it presents hoth sides of the argument I believe you will enjoy reading it. It is entitled ‘Is the Bible Really the Word of God?’ With it goes a modern translation of the Bible—both books on a contribution of just $1.25.” Then show appropriate chapters such as nine and ten on Bible prophecy and its fulfillment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It may be in your territory that people say they believe the Bible is God’s Word. How can you prepare in advance to show them the benefits that can be theirs by having the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Xeir World Translation?</span><span class="font12"> Consider </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘-Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font12"> on page 52 where Scripture texts that illustrate the improved understanding that results from modern translation are given. Also, you will find it to your advantage to consider </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font12"> on the subject &quot;Bible,” pages 228-232. Isn’t it true that the more we know about a subject the better prepared we are to discuss it intelligently and enthusiastically?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> While each of us can do personal study to prepare in advance, our book study servants can help us a great deal by offering suggestions of things we can say while going from door to door, by reminding us of a presentation we can use or by discussing with us what to say on a back-call or a Bible study. There is opportunity for this before and after the congregation book study and at meetings for field service. Such advance preparation privately and congregationally can equip us all to give an appropriate answer to those who ask a reason for the hope within us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• How are the needs of the infirm, handicapped and ill ones in the congregation to be handled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We all have the responsibility to show love to one another. (1 John 3:17, IS) Looking after &quot;orphans and widows in their tribulation&quot; is part of our worship of God. (Jas. 1:27; 2:14-17) Most often this is done spontaneously on a personal basis out of a loving desire to be of help to them. The congregation servant needs to be alert to the circumstances of older and afflicted ones. He may inform the congregation of those who are in need of loving care. He should also see that they regularly receive a copy of &quot;Kingdom Ministry” and are helped to attend the meetings If it is possible for them to do so. Upon learning that some need assistance, others in the congregation may stop by to help them in the field service, to bring them to meetings, or. where such is necessary, to assist them with their shopping, house cleaning or laundry. Sometimes just preparing a warm meal for an ill person Is much appreciated. It would be a kindness to read to blind persons or at times to tape-record talks or meeting parts for those who cannot attend the meetings.—See &quot;The Watchtower” for 1962, pages 438-442; 1966, pages 92-95.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Spiritually mature persons are not going to demand that others care for them or provide for them financially. For the most part the material needs of the older and infirm ones in the congregation are cared for by the individual's own resources, other family members or the state. Assistance can be given to acquaint such an individual with the provisions the state makes. (See February 1, 1966, issue of &quot;The Watchtower,” pages 95 and 96.) If none of the above-mentioned provisions are available to an individual. then the congregation may feel it necessary to step in, rendering financial assistance to worthy ones where necessary as it is able.—1 Tim. 5:9, 10; Gal. 6:10; see also the &quot;Lamp” book, page 134.</span></p>

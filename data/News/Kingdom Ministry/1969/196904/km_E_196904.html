<p><span class="font10">REJOICE! Yes, rejoice because of all the blessings of Jehovah on the work of our hands, yours and ours! Is it not wonderful what he is accomplishing in these days, even using imperfect human worshipers? And it is so clear that he purposes that a mighty witness be given in all the earth within a very short period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here at Bethel, with the help of our night shift, we have been blessed with a tremendous production of literature during the first ten weeks of 1969. Think of it! 5,637,901 bound hooks, a total of 82 publications, in 35 languages! Of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book alone, 632,251 in 31 languages! And laboring right along with us, operating a night shift too, the brothers in the German branch have produced over a million additional books. Can you see wiry we are all thrilled? Why, in one day here, March 6, we hit an all-time high in book production—123,600 !</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another cause for joy! Over 1,200,000 pounds of the foreign-language production is already on its way by boat to the ends of the earth, now that the dock strike has ended. So our brothers in many lands will soon be better equipped for their ministry. And we, too, can now have a generous supply, especially of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> books. In fact, all congregations are urged to order now a sufficient supply for May and June. Check your records to see how many books you have placed in past months, and order sufficient to make May and June two of the best bound hook months we have ever had. We will be offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book in May and the Bible in June. Don't you agree that those should be months, not only of greatly increased bound book placements, but also of intensified home Bible study activity? Every placement a potential Bible study—let that be our aim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was a real happy occasion on March 9 for an audience of 2,155 to witness the graduation of Gilead’s 47th Class—97 students equipped and eager to get off to their missionary assignments. However, many of</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Public Declaration</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Go from door to door preaching? Not me, I could never do that.” Sound familiar? Undoubtedly so, for many of us felt that way when we were first invited to share in making public declaration. (Rom. 10:10) But what changed our minds? Our love for God and our desire for salvation for ourselves and for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- Is this your first month in witnessing to God’s name and purposes? If so, we welcome you to the rapidly growing ranks of Jehovah’s praisers. (Rom. 6:17) There is plenty of work for all to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We know that a great many of you who will be sharing in making public declaration during April are of school age. Likely you will have some time free from school during the month. If so, what are your plans for using this time? Will you use it wisely? If you are dedicated you may have arranged to vacation pioneer sometime during the month. Fine! This is making excellent use of your time. Even if you are not yet dedicated you can work along them will continue with us until after the New York assembly, and we shall have their help in maintaining a high level of production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Between now and the summer assemblies there is surely much to be done. During May the Gilead School facilities will be used for a special refresher course for all circuit and district servants, one group each week. In June there will be special meetings here for branch servants who will be coming in from all parts of the world. So you see, our next Gilead class will not get started until the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Meantime, how busy we shall all be in the field, giving a witness worthy of the Kingdom ! Oui- special meeting of March 30 will have launched us into April’s many-featured ministry: vacation pioneering for many; the Memorial celebration ; the final month of our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">campaign; distribution of two spewith your parents, or others who may be pioneering, spending full days with them in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Whether newly associated, young in years, or long-time workers, all of us wiil want to take advantage of opportunities to place the splendid April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and the April 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> Could each of us arrange our affairs to spend a little more time in magazine activity during the month? The days are milder and getting longer, so it may be possible to spend some afternoons or evenings doing street magazine work or calling from door to door on the way to the book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The subscription department in the factory has been glad to work extra time handling ail the thousands of subscriptions coming in from congregations all over the country. How have you personally done in the campaign? Have you been able to obtain two or more subscriptions yet? If not, have you followed up al! the subscription promises? Why not check again </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font10">cial magazine issues, the April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> on the theme “Why Almighty God Laughs at the Nations,” ami the April 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> on “Are the Churches Nearing Their End?&quot; Wouldn’t it be fine for all of us to have an increased share in the witness during April? What a shout of praise, worthy of Jehovah’s kingdom I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By April, too, many students of tile </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book should be maturing to the point of participation with us iti the Kingdom witness. Let us do all we can to help them grasp this responsibility—this opportunity to show their appreciation, their love for the One who is opening to them the road to eternal life. Let us all attain to a rich measure of happiness during April, the happiness that conies with being satisfyingly busy in the great witness to God’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1969 356,057 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN FEBRUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We had an excellent month! There were 341,217 publishers taking part in the field service, 19,085 more than last February, and just 1,255 less than our October peak. What a joy it was to see so many zealous praisers of Jehovah brave the rigorous winter weather to preach the good news’ More and more Bible studies are being started. * We reached another high, conducting 322,374 studies, or 8,526 more than in our previous best month, January. Though the month was short, the zeal 'was not and we have received a blessing as a result. It is with keen anticipation that we look to see what growth the months ahead will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Declaration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">through your house-to-house records and see if there are any persons upon whom you promised to call back. You may find there are a number who took the magazines during the month 'and said they would consider the possibility of subscribing. Calling on all of these may yield additional subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">« As we look back over the joyful time we have spent thus far in the ministry, how glad we all are that we accepted the invitation to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. <sup>1</sup> '‘Basic to any real progress is regularity in participation,” says the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font10"> book in commenting on those who receive special privileges of service. (Page 189) How true that is! It is those who have developed a consistent pattern of ministerial service who have not only increased their joys in the ministry, hut also moved forward, to special privileges within the organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> No doubt our progress in the truth was due to some brother’s regularity in service. It was because he called to conduct a study regularly each week that we first began to realize the seriousness of the Kingdom message. You may have thought, “It must be important or he wouldn’t come without fail each week no matter what the weather conditions are.” Because of taking in spiritual food systematically at a given time each week you learned quickly and were soon able to express the truth to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> To become a spiritually sound, mature Christian calls for regular meeting attendance, as well as personal study of God’s Word. Joshua was counseled by Jehovah God that he needed regular personal study of the Scriptures to succeed as His servant. (Josh. 1:8) The same is true of us today. We may not be able to study everything we would like, or perhaps to learn as quickly as others, but having a pattern of daily or weekly study will assure us of making progress and of growth in spiritual strength.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Do you have a share in the field service regularly each week? It is something that we all should endeavor to do. In our secular work our everyday activity helps us to develop skill and proficiency. Likewise, when we are able to engage in the ministry often, daily if possible or at least weekly, we make more rapid progress. Those in the full-time service who have developed a good schedule tell us that when something such as sickness or other assignments interrupts their schedule they find they become somewhat rusty in their use of the “sword of the spirit.” If this is true of such ones, how important it is that congregation publishers maintain a schedule of at least weekly service to keep progressing in their ministry and to keep their faith strong. Jesus set a model example for us by his daily service to Jehovah.—Luke 19: 47. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is a pleasure to help others maintain regular activity, and we want to take advantage of our opportunities to do this. For example, some may be ill or elderly and unable to get out for extended periods. We could stop by and bring them a few magazines, which they could mail out to others, or perhaps we could help them write some letters. Later we could see that the reports of their activity are submitted to the congregation. Sometimes, too, a sister who has children may be ill or the children themselves may be ill and a whole month may go by without either the sister or the children being able to get into the field ministry. How much it is appreciated when an arrangement is made for someone to stop by and care for the children so the sister is able to get into the service or to take some of the children along in the ministry. In this way their progress continues and they do not miss a month of activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> There is one other aspect of regularity we do well to remember. A publisher would not qualify for appointment as a servant or a vacation or regular pioneer unless he had reported field service during each of the previous six months. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(“Lamp&quot;</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 118, 193, 199) How much better it is then to maintain a regular schedule of activity so we do not lose out on the blessings of sharing in such privileges of service.—-Gal. 6:9; Rev. 3 :14-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Young or old, all can show Jehovah their love for him by sharing regularly in the ministry in good weather or bad, in favorable season or troublesome season, in health or sickness. Our worship and praise will continue ascending daily to Jehovah in the new system of things, so now is the time to start showing our wholehearted devotion to him by regularity in service.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> You.will notice that the Pomona assembly is in the Spanish language only. There will be Spanish programs in conjunction with the assemblies held in New York, Chicago and Atlanta.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In most cases it will probably be your intention to attend the assembly nearest you as it will be most convenient. However, .we would like to ask all of the Michigan circuits to please attend at Chicago. We realize that the metropolitan Detroit area may be a few miles closer to Buffalo, but because of the size of the city and the limited convention facilities it will be to the advantage of you brothers in the Detroit area to attend the Chicago assembly. While the majority of publishers in circuits in western Ohio, by reason of distance, will no doubt attend at Chicago, we would also like to invite Ohio Circuits 8 and 11 to attend the Chicago assembly, even though Buffalo may be slightly closer.. We have your comfort and the comfort of others in mind in asking you to arrange your plans in this way.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Drawing Them Closer</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How many will attend the Memorial in your congregation on April 1? Quite likely it will be “the best crowd ever.” Last year in the United States there were 680,773 in attendance, compared to 333,672 who published in April. This means one interested person for every brother and sister, young arid old. If we have the same ratio this year, you can see that a tremendous potential for growth exists. The question is, What can we do to help draw these new ones closer to Jehovah?—Isa. 55:6; Jas. 4 : 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ Some who attend the Memorial for the first time need only to hear the invitation to attend other meetings and they do so, as was the case with an interested woman in Anguilla. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> page 180) However, as you know, most people require additional calls in order to be drawn closer to Jehovah through the meetings. It would be good for each of us to keep in mind whom he meets at Memorial who does not now attend meetings or have a study. We get acquainted there, so it would seem that while the special event is fresh in mind would be the time to make a friendly visit and encourage them to study, or at least to attend other meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> It is also true that many who attend are ones with whom studies are being conducted, but a great many may be only subscribers to the magazines, inactive ones or perhaps ones who respond to the invitation in the March 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> or the March 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> Surely Bible stud-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Convenlion Time Ahead </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">however, they will have the same program as the eight-day assemblies. In other'words, the sessions that will be held on the first day of an eight-day assembly will be worked into the forenoons during the first few days of a seven-day convention. Consequently you will not miss any of the program by attending a seven-day convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> We are certainly all looking forward to ‘assembling together’ in accordance with God’s commands. (Heb. 10; 24, 25) None of us want to miss any of the good things that Jehovah is providing for us through these conventions. Will you be there? ies would help such ones. You know the ones you personally invite and where they live, so you can call back on these and see their reaction to what they hear and see at the Memorial. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(.Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> page 68) Perhaps now they will accept your invitation to study. Even you young ministers can help by referring to your house-to-house records to see the ones who took the March 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and the March 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and call back on them. Whether they attended or not you will have the opportunity to give a further witness and let them know they are welcome at other meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup>The servants can help a great deal by setting the example in calling back on Interested ones and reminding others to build on the interest generated by the Memorial. We believe you will agree that calling while the interest is still warm is a help on all of our back-calls, especially so at Memorial time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jesus showed his loving concern for sheeplike ones by directing them into one fold. We want to follow his example and his command to shepherd the “sheep,” making sure that there are no strays, none who lack a shepherd or the helping care of a Kingdom publisher. (John 21: 15-17) We look to Jehovah to bless us as we endeavor to help all interested ones who attend the Memorial to draw closer to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">* Is it proper to solicit business among the brothers or use theocratic associations to arrange for parties for selling commercial goods?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The type of secular work that an individual does to support himself or his family is a personal matter. If a brother works at selling, then he should ask himself, “Am I takingadvantage of my theocratic associations for commercial gain?” Never would a brother want to do this. It is also well to consider the effect his sales work may have on others, being careful not to stumble them. —Phil. 1:9, 10; 2 Cor, 6:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If he wants to work for a commercial company that sells its products at home gatherings it is for him to decide. If some brothers wish to patronize a brother in business or invite him to come to their home to demonstrate his products, then this is their business. If others do not wish to purchase the products or attend parties where they are demonstrated, then they should never be made to feel obligated to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even if some commercial products are sold in homes, it is not proper to solicit the sale of products at the Kingdom Hall, book studies or at assemblies. This includes even those items that might be helpful in the ministry such as book bags and book covers.</span></p>

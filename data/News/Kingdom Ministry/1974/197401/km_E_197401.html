<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 1974</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Although the fig tree itself may not blossom, ... I will exult in Jehovah himself.”—Hab. 3:17, 18. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. XVII NO. 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark1"></a>kingdom</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">Certainly a lot of things have happened here at Bethel in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There was a big increase in the printing and placement of magazines world wide last year. So, now about a hundred brothers and sisters have been transferred from, Brooklyn to Watchtower Farm to provide magazine supplies from the facilities there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Meanwhile, here at Brooklyn the night shift in the factory has been expanded to increase book production. Since November 5 the night workers alone have been producing an average of some 80,000 additional books during each work period. In just one week recently over a million books were completed by the combined shifts! We rejoice that the interest you are finding in the field requires this great quantity of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">About the middle of November the first copies of the 197'4 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> came off the bindery lines. At Bethel we get some of the very first copies, and we have been reading about two pages from it each morning at breakfast. Have you been reading it? Don’t miss it! It looks like it is just what we need to prepare us for what lies ahead. And, as a suggestion, if there are any who were at one time associated with your congregation but have become inactive, why not take them a copy? When they read about the faithfulness and endurance of their brothers around the world it may prove to be just what they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As you know, the “Divine Victory” assemblies have not all been held as yet. Brother Knorr attended some of the recent ones and he said that in Mexico there were nineteen simultaneous assemblies, with 5,607 baptized. The total attendance of 170,091 was almost 110,000 more than the number of publishers. Just think of it! In Mexico City the crowd was so</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Aid Others to Search for Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It was to unfaithful Israelites that the appeal was directed: “Search for Jehovah, you people, while he may be found. Call to him while he proves to be near.” (Isa. 55:6) This indicated that Jehovah’s toleration of unfaithfulness had a limit. At the time of the execution of his judgment it would be too late to “search” for him, to come into a good relationship with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The position of all mankind today is similar to that of the unfaithful Israelites. Through us, as his witnessed, Jehovah is appealing to humans everywhere to come into an approved standing before him. (Acts 17:30, 31; 1 Tim. 2: 3, 4) The time for this is now great ly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The criticalness of the situation certainly impresses upon us the importance of being whole-souled in our efforts to aid others to “search” for Jehovah. This should stir us to devote as much great that people even climbed'onto the roof to get a glimpse inside. In Guatemala, where 493 were baptized, the attendance of 9,856 was about triple the number of publishers. Isn’t it marvelous to know that so many are showing a desire to learn about the approaching divine victory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And now, how about the distribution of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 17? After having seen what it contains, we were excited about it. When you write about other things, no doubt you will share with us experiences had in this special work. It is our prayer that this message will aid many more to get out of “Babylon the Great” and into Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah bless you richly as you continue to aid others to search for our loving God. We send you a warm expression of our love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">time to Kingdom-preaching as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> At times we meet people who say, “I get everything I need from my church.” But they need to be made aware of the seriousness of their situation. As was suggested in the November </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font11">you might ask whether their church has explained to them the meaning of Revelation 18:4. Have you been doing that? After reading or paraphrasing the text, show that this is an appeal on the part of God to his people. If they can be helped to recognize the importance of knowing what “Babylon the Great” is and of acting in harmony with that knowledge, they may be willing to study the Bible with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In the month of January we will be going back into the territory covered with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 17. That powerful message directed against false religion needs to be followed up. Some people may have questions. Do not let (’old weather discourage you from having a full share. Endeavor to participate in the house-to-house work regularly each week. The sooner we are at the doors of those who received the tract, the sooner they may be helped to act on what they have read. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is a fine instrument in assisting them to do just that. The material it contains has been prepared with them in mind. Be enthusiastic about encouraging them to subscribe.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In helping people to search • for Jehovah, we do not want to overlook the many who shared with us for the first time in tract distribution. They will need help to learn how to be effective Witnesses, using the Bible. Many will appreciate it if you offer them help. Will you do that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> May the month of January find all of us using every opportunity to help others to search for Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>* Aid Others to Search for Jehovah While He May Be Found. -k</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 13 12 min: Song 102. Introduction, text and comments. Also, choice portions of Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Aid Others to Search for Jehovah.” Questions and answers. Invite audience to read and comment on scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Improving Your Ability in the House-to-House Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two new publishers approach experienced brother to request assistance. They have shared in tract distribution; one has done magazine work. Would like to learn to use Bible at doors, to share in offering subscriptions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discuss together and demonstrate as in &quot;practice session” the following: (1) Introduction that is simple, friendly, really touches on something that is on mind of average householder. (2) Use of Bible. Actually read from it where possible; sometimes it is better to quote or to paraphrase text. In current sermon, we have several verses, all on the same page. Discuss brief comments that can be made on the scriptures. (3) Offering subscription. Show an appealing subject in current issue; read some comments from lefthand column on page 2, offer enthusiastically. (4) If questions are raised, simply answer from what you have learned. “Make Sure” can help you to locate scriptures. If you do not know the answer, offer to find it and to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Experienced publisher arranges to spend some time personally working with each of the other two in field ministry this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Accounts report. Also review with congregation appropriate points from instructions on &quot;How to Handle Subscriptions Properly” (in congregation file).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include comments on 2 Peter 3:13, 14, 17, 18. “Watchtower” study material for January 20 and 27 is timely and vital for all of Jehovah’s people; urge all to attend. Song 107.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 20 15 min: Song 115. Introduction, text and comments. Include Theocratic News, also Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: “Reaching Those Who Speak Another Language.” Discuss article, also local plans. Encourage magazine work this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Are You Using the “Comprehensive Concordance”? Discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a provision to help us improve our knowledge and effective use of God’s Word. Ideas on how to use it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To find a scripture that you remember having read or heard. Look under any word that you know is in the text. If you know approximately where it is in the Bible, start looking in that part of the list; it will save time. If you have difficulty in locating a particular text, use suggestions on page 6 of “Concordance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you simply want scriptures on a particular subject, but have none in mind, look up that subject and then select appropriate texts from those listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As part of your teaching on a home Bible study, you could show the student how to use it. This may enable him to study more productively on his own. Illustrate: Variations of the word “soul” appear almost a thousand times; “immortality” only three times, and never with the word “soul.” To emphasize God’s love, under “loving-kindness” show 26 listings for 26 verses of Psalm 136. Significance of name “Jehovah” is shown by the fact that over 25 pages are required to list the occurrences of this name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Parents might use it effectively in teaching children. Por example, ' quiz them on a variety of subjects for which they must find a Bible answer; have them use “Concordance” along with Bible. Or, if a child needs to have a certain matter impressed on his mind, possibly because he has been negligent in caring for assigned chores, he might be assigned to look up the fourteen references under “lazy” and to list the various reasons given in those verses for avoiding laziness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No doubt you have a copy of the “Comprehensive Concordance” in your home library; make good use of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">23 min: Meeting Together Even in the Face of Difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Audience discussion; include reading of selected portions from “1974 Yearbook.” Plan carefully in advance, considering available time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ask audience: (1) Why do we come together for meetings? (De.ut. 31:12; Rom. 1:11, 12) (2) Why is it important to meet together regularly? (Heb. 10: 25; 1 Cor. 10:12) (3) What could you do about obeying these Bible commands if our work were banned and this Kingdom Hall were closed? (“Organization” book, p. 186)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is much that we can learn from the experiences of our brothers in Germany. Beneficial to do so; the same enemy, Satan, is still trying to disrupt our service to God; we personally may feel greatly increased pressure in days to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Arrange in advance for publishers to answer these questions by reading or paraphrasing brief excerpts: (4) Once banned, where did our brothers meet? (Highlight locations mentioned in “Yearbook” on p. 130, par. 1; p. 145, par. 4; p. 146, par. 2; p. 152, par. 1; p. 181, par. 3.) (5) How did they show discretion as to the time of arrival at the meetings? (“yb” p. 135, par. 3) Good to consider whether we would appreciate meetings enough to go that early. (6) W<sup>T</sup>hat precautions did the brothers take while meeting together? (“yb” p. 144, par. 5; p. 194, par. 3) (7) If under ban, what literature could we use for study at our meetings? (“or” p. 186; “yb” pp. 114, 115; p. 191, par. 4; p. 194, par. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If we are determined to be obedient to Jehovah, and rely on him, he will bless our efforts. Briefly relate experience in “Yearbook” on pp. 135-138, emphasizing that those brothers risked life and freedom to meet together; not one held back. And, despite danger, they also went out to call on their neighbors with the Kingdom message. As of now we have much freedom; use it wisely. Be sure to attend public talk and “Watchtower” study this week; the study material is vital. Share fully in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Conclude with Song 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Song 3. Introduction, text and comments. Include talk on article “How Strong Is Your Love of Truth?” from October 1, 1973, “Watchtower.” 10 min: Experiences in Field Ministry. Plan in advance. Invite publishers to relate experiences enjoyed during recent weeks. Might include results from offering “Watchtower” subscription, also Kingdom News No. 17 and joy of making return visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Improving Your Ability in Disciple-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two publishers approach experienced brother to request help in making return visits, starting Bible studies. To date, they have only gone from door to door, but not called back; feel unqualified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discuss together and demonstrate, as appropriate, the following: (1) What to note on House-to-House Record with a view to making return call. (2) What to do on initial call to prepare the way for return visit. (3) Preparing for the call. Keep it simple, but stress value of preparation, having something definite in mind that fits needs of specific householder. (4) How to use chapter 1 of “Peace and Security” book to start a study. Point out the grouping of paragraphs on first two pages; can cover this briefly and then concentrate on Scriptural material starting with paragraph 9. Emphasize that all the needed material is right there in the book. Discuss what to do if questions arise to which new publisher does not know the answer. (5) When to make return visits; value of spending some time in this work regularly each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Benefited by the “Yearbook.” Two publishers walk up aisle toward platform. One mentions that he read something very interesting in “Yearbook.” Reads aloud experience from India, on page 20, par. 4. Both comment on fact that angels are directing field ministry (Rev. 14:6; Matt. 25:31, 32); want to put themselves in position to be used by the angels; mention arrangements for witnessing on weekend; make plans to go out together. 15 min: Concluding comments. Incorporate choice items from “Insight on the News,” in recent issues of “The Watchtower”; emphasize Scriptural viewpoint. Encourage use of magazines in field service. Song 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Song 20. Introduction, text and comments. Family discusses; then chairman analyzes with father what was done and what can be done to involve all the family and help them to appreciate how it affects their lives. 10 min: Thorough Territory Coverage. It is important for everyone to hear the Kingdom message. Draw from audience comments on what they do when no one is at home; effort put forth to call back; reaching persons in apartment houses, permanent hotel residents, etc. Have one or two well-organized publishers comment on how they keep their service records so that they stay in good condition and are not lost. If some territory is in special need of attention, inform congregation. 15 min: “What About Those Who Still Hold Back?” Talk, along with experiences about helping such persons. Discuss application of material to local needs. Emphasize reaching heart as we teach. If certain ones do not progress, explain why it may be best to discontinue studying with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers. Include any local experiences that fit this material. 10 min: Concluding comments. Include any appropriate Announcements. Comment on Hebrews 10:36. Song 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What About Those Who StlBI Held </span><span class="font13">Back?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Most of us know of interested persons in our territory who have responded favorably to the Kingdom message. We have studied with some through the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book and, in some cases, other publications as well. They attend meetings from time to time, show a willingness to be identified with Jehovah’s witnesses and profess to accept most of the fundamental teachings of God’s Word. Yet, they do not join us in the preaching work. They hold back from ‘disowning themselves’ and getting baptized. (Matt. 16:24; 28:19) Is there something more that we can do to help them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Such ones may have a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes but have yet to acquire the necessary love for him. (Eph. 3:18, 19) Put simply, the truth may be in their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">head</span><span class="font11"> but not yet in their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In studying with them, encourage them to give thought to the implications of what they are learning. Reason with them in such a way that they will ask themselves: What will this ultimately mean for me and my family? If they have learned, for example, the identifying traits of the true religion, can they honestly say that their former religion is the true one? If not, then it must be a false one and part of the empire of false religion for which God’s Word clearly foretells destruction in the near future. Logical reasoning dictates that ties</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Announcements</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font9">Literature offer, January through April: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50. If you wish, include </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> subscription, along with six booklets, for $3.00. Continue to carry copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Years </span><span class="font9">book and the pocket-sized books, offering them when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font9">On March 31 all congregations will have a special public talk on the subject “Surviving on the Victorious Side at Har-Magedon.” A copy of the manuscript will be sent to each congregation in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The Memorial for 1974 will be held on Sunday, April 7, after 6 p.m., S.T. Other meetings that are normally held on Sunday should be scheduled for another day. Memorial invitations may be ordered in lots of 250 for 25c, 500 for 50c, or 1,000 for $1. Please be sure that exact payment accompanies each order. ♦ After January 1, 1974, congregations may begin ordering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font9"> for 1973; 10c each. All orders for this item will be charged to your congregation literature account. The Society also has a good stock of 1971 and 1972 Indexes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Before submitting subscriptions for the' </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign, please review carefully the instructions in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font9"> book on page 152, also the memorandum on “How to Handle Subscriptions Properly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ If it is necessary for you to call the Society’s Brooklyn offices, keep in mind </span><span class="font11">maintained with that system will ultimately bring death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Try to get them to think in terms of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">applying</span><span class="font11"> what they learn. For example, they may have learned that the celebration of certain holidays is not pleasing to God. The question now is, What will they do when these celebrations come along? How will they react when their relatives, friends and working companions try to involve them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes they hold back because of reluctance to accept some fundamental truth. They may frankly tell you, for example, that they are unable to take a firm stand on the use of blood transfusions. After reviewing what the Bible has to say on the matter, try to help them to analyze the basis for their objection. Can they honestly say that the Bible is not clear on the subject? Probing questions may reveal that they actually hold back, not because they cannot see the Bible’s teaching, but because they fear the reactions of others if they follow it. The issue, then, boils down to one question: Whom will they try to please—God or man?—Prov. 29:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Time grows short and the need for a definite stand becomes increasingly urgent. With discernment in our teaching, we may be able to cultivate their heart appreciation so that they will take their stand on Jehovah’s side while there is still opportunity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN OCTOBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was an 8.1-percent increase over last year’s average number of publishers, and that is fine! It is true that many who shared in tract work in September were not out again in October. They have shown a desire to serve Jehovah, but now they need encouragement to follow through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The total of subscriptions obtained was down somewhat. But there was a fine new peak in number of regular pioneers; it is good to see that 814 more arranged their affairs to get into this branch of full-time service. Also, magazine placements, return visits and home Bible studies all showed fine increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">that the phone number (212) 858-1240 is a number that may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ A new series of eight public talk outlines will soon be sent to all congregations. We encourage you to include these in your meeting schedule before the month of June.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Reaching Those Who Speak Another Language</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What can we do when we meet persons in our territory who speak a foreign language? We would like very much to share something with them. In some cases, we make a futile attempt to communicate and finally end up simply smiling and walking away. When that happens, we feel a sense of frustration because we know we have something that they need and it is disappointing when we fail to reach them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps your congregation has sections of territory where some foreign language is predominantly spoken. You may have expressed concern from time to time about being unable to communicate with these people, particularly when something really outstanding is published. Here is a suggestion: Congregations holding such territory may wish to order a supply of the. foreign-language issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> in which special articles are to appear. A concerted effort could then be made to work this foreignspeaking territory, offering the magazines that contain these timely articles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In some cases, perhaps the field overseer can arrange for a small group of publishers to concentrate on reaching these foreignspeaking people. If the territory is quite large, more extensive arrangements can be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Calls could be made simply inviting the householder to obtain the magazine for the usual contribution. If it is difficult to communicate due to the language barrier, you may find it helpful to use the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Preach the Word” </span><span class="font11">booklet. Or, you may decide it is best just to leave the magazines as a gift, hoping they will be read.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Everyone is busy these days, including us. The daily schedule of activity keeps family members in most households scurrying about trying to get everything done. When we locate someone who shows interest in the truth, it may be quite difficult to make contact with the person later because of conflicting schedules. When this happens, are you willing to make some adjustment in your personal activity to accommodate the individual? If we truly have a tender affection for sheeplike ones, then we will try to work out things for their advantage, showing a willingness to inconvenience ourselves, if necessary, to help them.—1 Cor. 10:24; Rom. 15:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Some communities have many shift workers who are required to work at odd hours. If you find such a person who shows interest, would you be willing to call early in the morning or perhaps late at night to conduct, a study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Wives who want to study will often request that you conduct a study at a time when the husband and the children can be present. In other situations, there may be opposing relatives in the home and you will be asked to come at a time when they are absent. Some circumstances might require that you conduct the study in your own home or possibly somewhere else. Would you do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is not unusual to locate an interested person who can study only at a time when you have no car available or you are unable to get someone to go with you. If it is necessary, would you be willing to take public transportation or even walk to get there? If there is no one to accompany you, w<sup>r</sup>ould you go alone if it were safe to do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It is a common thing to make arrangements for a study and find, after you get there, that something unavoidable has come up that prevents them from having the study. If they sincerely appreciate the study and ask you to return later during the day or possibly another day during the w’eek, would you gladly do so?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Many congregations have territories that are not worked regularly because they are a distance away and considerable traveling is required to work them. Do you feel enough concern for the people in that area so that you are willing to spend the extra time and travel expense necessary to reach them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Often it is difficult to find people at home on the weekend when most of us are able to share in the field service. If it were suggested in your congregation, would you be agreeable to an adjustment in meeting times or service arrangements so that your efforts would accomplish greater good?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> An opportunity for a good study may present itself at a time that your family has set aside for recreation or caring for personal matters. Would your family members be agreeable to making other arrangements or even to forgo something unnecessary so that you could conduct a Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Of course, it is up to each one of us to decide the extent to which we can reasonably adjust our affairs to accommodate those who want help. However, if we feel like Paul, we will be willing to ‘impart our own souls,’ working night and day to assist sheeplike ones to learn of the hope that can save their lives. •—1 Thess. 2:8, 9.</span></p></li></ul>

Thus people will become acquainted with the fine material in both magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">9</span><span class="font9"> What factor's should be considered if you are thinking about moving to serve where the need is greater?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Much good has been accomplished by publishers <sub>s</sub>who, with a desire to serve Jehovah .w</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">hole-souled</span><span class="font9">, have offered themselves -for such work. And there still are areas -where there is considerable need for z</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ealous</span><span class="font9"> publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, n(fF everyone’s circumstances are the best for this sort of work.

Young persons may encounter problems- if they are in an isolated area without the guidance and assistance of their parents or some older person. And a brother with a large family to support may find it difficult to care for that responsibility if he moves into an economically depressed area. Before deciding to move, it is good to consider factors such as </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">these that h</span><span class="font9">ave a bearing on one's &quot;spiritual, condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1T you believe that your circumstances are suitable for a move, then talk it over with your family, also the elders in your congregation, realistically analyzing your reasons to be sure you are prompted by a desire to do more in Jehovah’s service. A long move may not be necessary; consult with your circuit overseer about the needs in your own area. If you wish, write the branch office for suggestions, making sure to provide us with all the information requested in the “Organization” book on page 135.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When you decide on a location, it would be wise to visit the area to get some idea about the climate and to get acquainted with the brothers. You can inquire about school facilities, and investigate opportunities for housing and employment. If you find that you truly will be able to do more in Jehovah’s service by making the move, then by all means do so, with full trust in Jehovah. But if, even at this point, such a move does not seem wise, remember that there is much that you can do in Jehovah’s service where you are right now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Good news! Reports now compiled show that in this country alone the attendance at the Memorial this year was 1,182,112. That is 135,766 more than last year—a 13-percent increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the subscription campaign was excellent. You will be happy to hear that the number of new subscriptions obtained during the four-month campaign is up more than 33 percent over last year—a total of 683,193! By the way, have you also noticed the circulation figures for the magazines? They are now well above 8,000,000 copies for each issue of both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We all enjoyed sharing in distribution of the “Government by God” tract during May, didn’t we? It was a most timely subject. Already in the first few weeks the office here has. received many hundreds of coupons requesting books and studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Other interesting news that we have heard at Bethel concerns Brother Henschel’s latest zone visit to southern Europe and other countries bordering the Mediterranean. When passing through the Iberian peninsula he learned that pressure on our brothers in Portugal has let up, because the new government there has arrested the former secret police. He also heard that censorship of the mails was to be lifted and freedom of religion restored to the people in Portugal, who have long been under the domination of the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Spain hit a new peak of 24,820 publishers in April, but, Brother Henschel reports, in the same month there were 60,022 at the Memorial. Amazing, too, was the turnout when he spoke in Barcelona. With only a week’s notice, and by special invitation only, 22,417 packed out the Monumental Bull Ring. Most of the imprisoned brothers have now been released, and for those that were present</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Support Earth's New King</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Christ is actively ruling as king. If it is his kingship that we support, there are opportunities every day to show that. After his resurrection and before ascending into heaven in 33 C.E., Christ Jesus entrusted to his disciples the field of interest that he had cultivated respecting God’s Messianic kingdom. This field they could make productive by assisting interested ones to progress to Christian maturity. The wealth that Jesus wanted then was not gold and silver but more disciples. (Luke 19:16; Matt. 28:19, 20) Today, nineteen centuries later, the anointed remnant left on earth have the same privilege of thus working for earth’s new King, Jesus Christ. And the “great crowd” of other sheep are extended the opportunity of assisting them in this grand work.—Rev. 7:9; Luke 19:11-27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> July will furnish excellent opportunities for showing our support of earth’s new King by urging others to put their confidence in his rulership. To aid in this work, we will be offering the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—From What Source?</span><span class="font11"> on a contribution of 25c. Other pocket-size publications can be carried along if desired and, in fact, some of the larger bound books can also be taken along in case people have the smaller publications. Bible studies can be started in any of these publications this assembly was a very special treat.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">No national assembly was arranged in Italy either in connection with Brother Henschel’s visit, yet when he spoke in Rome, 20,964 gathered to hear his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this country the “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies begin in June. A wonderful spiritual feast has been prepared. Please don’t miss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">in which the householder shows interest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> July will be assembly month for many of us, and our attending along with others who believe in the Kingdom is a fine way to show our support for the King. The program will offer much that will allow us personally to be strengthened in a spiritual way. Also, our Christian conduct when we are traveling to and from these assemblies can attract honest-hearted ones to the King we serve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If attending an assembly and going on vacation will take you away from your congregation during the latter part of July and the beginning of August, be sure to turn in a field service report before you leave home; the remainder of your activity for that month can be reported the following month. Or, if you prefer, take along report slips and the address of the field overseer, and send him your reports at the end of the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Young or old, male or female can share in the King’s work. Summer is a time when the young ones usually have more time to serve. There is still time to temporary pioneer before school begins. Talk to your parents and then your presiding overseer if you have been thinking about it. The Bible counsels: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”—Eccl. 12:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Hundreds of thousands of persons have been streaming into Jehovah’s visible organization in recent years, just as he indicated they would. Proverbs 14:28 says: “In the multitude of people there is an adornment of a king, but in the lack of population is the ruin of a high official.” All of us take great pleasure in being an “adornment” to our King, Jesus Christ. It is a joy to have some share in making disciples of still others and, in doing so, showing our support for Christ as our King.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Song 19. Introduction, text and comments. Include discussion of Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Accounts report. Include comments from May 1, 1974, “Watchtower” article, “Tenderly Compassionate—Like Our God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Support Earth’s New King.” Questions and answers. Include some experiences that publishers locally have enjoyed in offering and placing the “Peace and Security” book thus far this month or in previous campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Two Promises of Peace and Security. Sermon for use in presenting the “Peace and Security” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman should point out that publishers may decide how they can best present this book in the territory. However, we will discuss and demonstrate a sermon that publishers might like to try. It can be made brief and simple if that is what the publisher prefers. Or, it can be lengthened, depending upon the householder’s response. It fits the “Peace and Security” book. Can use scriptures with it or not, depending upon circumstances. Also, can use just one scripture or more, depending upon interest found. Publisher can decide where to pause to ask a question and draw the householder into the conversation. (Chairman: The above points are important. So, get them clearly in mind and make them stand out clearly in your introductory remarks.) Chairman should discuss with audience first the introduction; consider advantages of following the outlined thoughts closely, also whether any adjustments would be advantageous for local territory. Then consider with audience the body and conclusion of this Scriptural discussion. The information is taken from the “Peace and Security” book, Chapter 1, especially paragraphs 10 and 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theme: Two Promises of Peace and Security</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Good morning! My call will be brief, but I have an important message. The point is this: Today, in a time of real trouble, there are promises of peace and security. These promises come from two sources: First, from men —national leaders. Second, from God, through his Word, the Bible. These are the differences in the two promises:</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font9">o With the August </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry \ </span><span class="font9">there will be an insert. Please remove all of these from the copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> before they are distributed to the congregation. Trim them neatly along the left-hand edge so as to separate pages 3 and 4 from pages 5 and 6. The first portion will be distributed to newly interested ones at the conclusion of the first meeting in September; the second portion will be distributed at the second service meeting in September, to those who are publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O With the September issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> the Society plans to provide details concerning a special series of public talks to be given in the congregations during November and December. To the extent possible, we recommend that they be scheduled on consecutive weeks until they have all been heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦'It is requested that, on the next literature order for the congregation,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Men promise to reduce arms by treaties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">God says he will remove the root cause of war. (Isa. 2:2-4)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Men say they -will control crime.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">God says he will root out attitudes and conditions that start crime. (Gal. 5:19-21)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Men promise better care for the sick and aged,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">God says he will completely eliminate sickness and problems of old age. (Rev. 21:3, 4)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Why believe God? For one thing, because his promises have never failed, whereas promises of men on these matters have failed to produce true peace and security. (Josh. 23:14)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">People have the right to know these things. They are made clear in this book “True Peace and Security—From What Source?” We place it on a contribution of 25 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(If you find a listening ear and feel that more could be said, read some of the scriptures; otherwise, just state the points, if possible, and offer the book. Use as many of the four points as you think best.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Have capable, experienced publisher demonstrate thoroughly prepared sermon without the scriptures. Then have second such publisher give demonstration with some of the scriptures. Chairman concludes with appropriate comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Local field service plans. Song 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments. Include thoughts from the article &quot;How presiding overseers order for each regular pioneer twelve monthly report cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Literature offer for July: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—From What Source?</span><span class="font9"> for 25c. You may also carry other 25c publications or larger books in case householders have the smaller ones. For August: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font9"> or other pocket-size publication for 25c. For September: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> book for 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O Beginning in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk “Into the New Order Under Christ’s Leadership.” District overseers will speak on the subject “What the Near Future Holds.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: “The Music You Choose.” Talk based on May 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article. Might be good to draw audience into the discussion to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —What Prompts People to Listen?” Discuss with audience by means of questions and answers. After discussing each separate reason why some people might listen, chairman could take time to ask audience: “If this is true, then what is required on our part? How can we prepare ourselves and our presentations so as to improve and get more people to listen? Can you think of some scriptures that show the need to have these qualities mentioned?” Other like questions can be used in order to make application of points.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments. Offer some helpful suggestions regarding presenting the “Truth” book in August. Of course, any other pocket-size book can be used too. Can carry larger books along also. Could continue to use same sermon as in July. Note how the thoughts in that discussion fit in with points made in Chapter 1 of “Truth” book. Paragraph 9 shows failure of man’s rule. Paragraph 5 shows how God will eliminate sickness and death. Paragraph 6 shows why we can believe God’s promises. Song 26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Social Gatherings</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people enjoy getting together. This is true of small groups, as in a family, and of larger assemblies. The Bible encourages us to do this, with a view to inciting one another to Christian love and fine works.—Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It is not only at congregation meetings that we enjoy being together. At times, two or more family groups get together to do Bible reading or to prepare for the weekly </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. On occasion, they may also arrange to spend time together, not primarily for Bible study, but. for relaxation and recreation. This, too, can be upbuilding. But, of course, when you plan such a gathering, it is not wise to make it larger than you can adequately supervise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Occasionally we hear that brothers or sisters have rented facilities for dancing, skating and other socializing by Witnesses. The Society has received a number of letters from brothers who are disturbed over what they observe or hear is taking place. Are such arrangements proper?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is not the business of the Society or the elders in the congregations to make rulings as to what individuals may or may not do in arranging social gatherings, although loving counsel by the elders is certainly appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It definitely is proper for Christians to be hospitable. (Rom. 12: 13) But when arranging to entertain others, the size of the gathering is a factor to consider. Experience has shown that there can be pitfalls and problems in connection with large social gatherings. The one who is the host has a serious responsibility. He is accountable for what takes place at a gathering that is under his jurisdiction. At a get-together in one’s own home it is not usually difficult to determine who will be present and what the activities will be. But problems along these lines may increase when there is a large group in a rented facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It is wise to know who you are welcoming as close associates. The disciple Jude wrote that there are some who, while professing to be fellow Christians, turn “the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct.” He warned against fleshly-minded persons who, he said, were like “rocks hidden below water in your love feasts while they feast with you, . . . wild waves of the sea that foam up their own causes for</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Study»!mportcant odd Your LLnfe</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Newly interested ones continue to come into Jehovah’s visible organization in great numbers. Thousands swell attendances at our Kingdom Halls; many of them soon start out in the field service and get baptized. It is indeed a thrill to see these increases take place and to see these new praisers of Jehovah become a part of the theocratic society. But this is only the beginning. Continued spiritual growth is necessary in order to be pleasing to Jehovah. What will help in this? For one thing, reading and studying must become an important part of one’s life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> ‘But study, concentrating on what one is reading, is not easy,’ some will say, and that is often true. Just what is it that has assisted many to be good students and to find joy in keeping right up-to-date with the truth as it is made clear through the “faithful and discreet slave”? Being </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">interested</span><span class="font11"> in what one is doing is one of the most important factors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Interest can fluctuate. However, there are things that we can do to keep interest in studying the truth at a high level. As the apostle Peter wrote, “Form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word.” (1 Pet. 2:2) Such a “longing” can be cultivated. Be persistent in your prayers to God shame.” (Jude 4, 12, 13) So it is good to be cautious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Of course, it is not only what others may do that should be of concern to us. Our own conduct and any activities in which we might invite others to engage likewise deserve serious thought. At 1 Corinthians 10:31 the apostle Paul set out a principle that should guide us, saying: “Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.” If we do this, there will be nothing about what we eat or drink or the way we do it that might stumble others. Our attire will be modest, as befits Christians. Our conversation will be wholesome—in sharp contrast with the foolish talking and obscene jesting of the world. And, if there is dancing, we certainly will not do it in a manner that might stimulate unclean desires. Are these things really true of your social activities?—Rom. 14:13, 21; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; Eph. 5:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> As individuals, our needs as to recreation may vary. But is it wise to give it such prominence that one travels long distances, spending considerable money, in order to be for knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Also, persevere in your personal efforts to acquire such through study. “Keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you,” said Jesus.—Matt. 7:7; John 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Study means to set the mind upon a subject systematically to learn it for future use. What future use? For one thing, to help others. We are God’s witnesses. Having a keen desire to remember so as to help others will stimulate us to study and we will retain the information longer. This means having an unselfish motive in study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Field service stimulates interest in study. None of us have all the answers to questions that people might ask as we share in the field service. But how do you feel when you do not have a ready answer to a question asked by a householder? Do you feel an urge to do the necessary research so as to get the answer and, if possible, to return and share it with the householder?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>G</sup> Many of Jehovah’s servants in times past set fine examples in applying themselves to learn God’s will so as to do it more fully. The psalmist said: “How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.” (Ps. 119:97) Has that come to be true of you too?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">in on every social event? And even of get-togethers that are close to home, if those who attend do not get home until late at night, how many will feel refreshed physically or stimulated spiritually for congregation meetings or field service the next morning?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> There are times when congregations plan group travel for a tour of one of the Society’s branch offices, or to an assembly, perhaps with stops along the way for a picnic or for sight-seeing. But, as for activities that are purely recreational, the congregations usually find it best to leave arrangements for such things to individuals. And, since the times for meetings are set by the congregation as a whole, they do not lightly set these aside when certain ones in their midst express a desire to arrange for an outing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Spending time for relaxation has its proper place and can provide enjoyment and benefit. But our principal concern is to strengthen our brothers spiritually and to accomplish fully the urgent work of preaching and making disciples. To this end we need to give serious thought to using our time wisely.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What is it that, right from the start, attracts you to a certain person more than to others? Is it that person’s friendliness? Undoubtedly that is a factor. And, no doubt, honest-hearted ones that we meet in our field service react similarly. Some brothers project this friendliness more readily than others. Their countenance easily brightens up into a warm smile that invites trust and confidence. Is it possible for you to be more friendly without being overly so, “sweetish” so to speak? The first impression is important and, undoubtedly, in many cases is what determines whether the householder will listen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Some listen to us because it is obvious to them that we are interested in their welfare and have a sincere desire to help. We all have that desire or else we would not be calling on others. But to convey that feeling quickly to the householder we need to have it prominent in our own thoughts. Some brothers and sisters, though they cannot express themselves as well in the language of the country, readily convey to people their sincerity. At times, if one is too fluent or smooth, people are reminded of a fast-talking salesman and tend to get suspicious. And if we repeat the same introduction too often, we may begin to sound mechanical. But if we really feel sincere interest in the householder and speak from the heart, the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One way to show people that you are interested in them is to listen to what they say. This does not mean simply to stand politely silent while they speak. It means listening with sincere interest. Then you can comment intelligently on what they have said, showing that you are interested in their viewpoint and also understand it. This will aid you to witness with their viewpoint in mind. We have long been encouraged not to do all the talking but to ask questions so as to draw the householder into the conversation. Circuit and district overseers indicate that many publishers are doing this well, but they also observe that some could beneficially give more thought to this matter of really listening to the householder after asking a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Mostly, though, people listen because of what you say. What you speak is the good news of the Kingdom, and Christ Jesus said the sheep would hear his voice and respond. (John 10:4, 16) The subject you introduce attracts them. The thoughts you express have the ring of truth to them. You really believe what you are saying, so you speak with confidence and conviction. What you talk about is something that you clearly understand, thus what you say is understandable to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> So there are various reasons why people listen to us at the door. Usually it is the message itself that attracts honest-hearted ones. But sometimes it is our friendliness, sometimes it is our interest in them and at times it might be something else that moves them to stay at the door long enough to hear what the message is. It is good to analyze what we do, to see if we can determine just why people listen on a certain occasion or why they do not. Then we can set about to make improvements or to strengthen certain qualities where this might be necessary. Not only will we be cultivating qualities that Jehovah wants to see in us, but we will be making ourselves better representatives of him in the preaching and teaching work.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question. (Sox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">° Are parents to count as time in the field service the hours that they devote to teaching<sup>1</sup> and training their unbaptized children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The responsibility of teaching children Jehovah’s way requires much time and effort on the part of both parents. God-fearing parents should be alert to do this in various ways all day long. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:4) Whether the time used in this way shows up on a field service report or not has no bearing on the seriousness of the responsibility. There are many things that we do in connection with our service to God. Actually, very little of it is reported as field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">However, the Society is interested in compiling a report of activity in the field service, service performed in carrying Bible truths to those of mankind who are not yet part of the Christian congregation. So what we report is largely our activity in preaching- to the public, those who are not dedicated, baptized Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">However, in answer to many letters asking the question raised above, the Society has stated that, if a study is regularly scheduled and conducted with one’s unbaptized children, just as we handle other home Bible studies in the field, then, if the parent desires to do so, the one who conducts the study may report one hour and one return visit, a week, and one home Bible study for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We believe that it is best to limit the reporting- of activity in connection with teaching one’s unbaptized children to that; otherwise the field service report of the congregation would soon not give much of .an indication of what is being done about carrying the good news out to the public, the world of mankind.</span></p>

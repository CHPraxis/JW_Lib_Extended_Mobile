<p><span class="font10">You will be interested in some of the details of Brother Knorr’s recent trip to the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Japan he arranged to purchase two more rotary presses— one for Japan, the other for the Philippines. Some bookbinding machinery was also ordered for the Brooklyn factory. Before leaving for South Korea he went over plans to purchase more property and enlarge the Bethel home and factory in Numazu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Like Japan, South Korea is also seeing tremendous expansion in the Kingdom work. So, on this trip, plans were finalized for a three-story addition to the Bethel home in Seoul. From there, Brother Knorr went on to the island of Okinawa for the dedication of a new branch home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Short stops were then made in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Vietnam and the Philippines, where similar expansion problems were handled. Hong Kong has especially enjoyed a fine increase during the past year. The Philippine Bethel family was overjoyed to learn that they were getting another rotary press. They even volunteered to take on the printing of the Chinese magazines when they get'it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few days after Brother Knorr returned to Brooklyn he announced that six more German-built rotary presses were on order (two for our German factory- and four for Watchtower Farm), plus about two and a half million dollars’ worth of bindery machinery. This will raise the capacity for book production in Germany to 11,000,000 and in Brooklyn to 60,000,000 a year during regular daytime working hours!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other news concerns our brothers in war-torn Cyprus. We have learned that the brothers in the branch, and 350 to 400 other brothers, had to abandon their homes and take refuge in the Greek-held part of the island. Later, a few brothers, at great risk, returned to the branch building when the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commanded his disciples to be witnesses of him “to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) In carrying out that commission his followers have used every appropriate means. They are keenly aware that the “good news” is to be declared “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” (Rev. 14:6) Reports confirm that the work is being done, and it is our privilege to share in it.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For fifty-five years, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> has been used to carry the message of the Kingdom to appreciative readers around the globe. Every two weeks, more than 8 million copies in 31 languages are put into the hands of a wide variety of people. It will be a pleasure to feature </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> again during October.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Most people identify </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">as a companion to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> So why not offer both subscriptions, with six booklets, for $3.00? Both may be just as readily accepted, and the benefits will be twofold.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font10"> has promised to publish factual information about “vital topics on which you should be informed.” Regular readers confirm that it certainly does that.

<p><span class="font10">Turks were only 100 meters away, and were able to rescue some important records, files and literature. These were transferred to the missionary home in Limassol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As far as is known, no brothers on Cyprus have lost their lives due to the fighting, but ten brothers living in the Turkish area are yet to be heard from. The branch in Greece has been instructed to ship whatever they can in the way of bedding, foodstuffs and money to aid our brothers on Cyprus.</span></p>

But </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> provides insight that other news sources do not; it shows the meaning of it all and what the outcome will be. People need to know these things; this is a compelling reason for us to share wholeheartedly in the effort to obtain subscriptions during October.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Much good is also accomplished by distribution of the individual copies of the magazines. During October we have outstanding issues of both magazines to use.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font10"> is one of the many means that Jehovah’s people are using to get the “good news” preached everywhere. Jehovah is certainly blessing these efforts with marvelous expansion! In the United States, a large proportion of the congregations are working their territory every six months or less. Arrangements were made for all the 223 unassigned territories to be covered by congregations or by temporary special pioneers during the summer months. More are taking up the regular pioneer service, over 1,000 being added to the ranks every month. Besides that, tens of thousands have enrolled as temporary pioneers. Results are seen in that most Kingdom Halls are crowded to capacity, and new congregations are being formed at a rate of more than one a day. Very fine indeed!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 89. Introduction and brief family discussion of text. Family members also share with one another any good experiences heard in recent weeks from local publishers who had success in locating interested persons or starting Bible studies. Next, discuss obtaining of subscriptions; have various family members offer suggestions as to w’here they hope to obtain them: by house-to-house activity, from a neighbor or workmate, by 'giving a gift subscription, by calling back on an interested person, etc. Comment briefly on October 22 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> and why the featured subject is appropriate; briefly show how to offer it in magazine work. Father review’s congregation’s field service arrangements for the week; discuss how’ they as a family can share, w’ith special emphasis on magazine distribution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">How’ to Engage Householders in Bible Discussions. Experienced publisher encourages newer one to snare in house-to-house w’ork w’ith regular offer, using Bible. Cover these points: (1) Jehovah uses all kinds of persons; not great personal ability but willingness needed. (2) We realize that most of the Jew’s rejected Jesus; w<sup>r</sup>e cannot expect a majority of persons to listen to us. (3) Select one scripture; be walling to read it if householder is willing to listen: practice doing it. (4) Discuss appropriate introductions that will stimulate interest and encourage householders to comment. (5) Listen when householder speaks; be discerning, not pushy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. Branch Letter. If not already done, presiding overseer for the past year may review’ encouraging highlights made in his report to the branch office, also offer recommendations about what to work on during the coming year.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Reporting Field Service. A talk. Questions have been raised about reporting time in the field service. Some ask if it is proper to count time spent taking “coffee breaks’’ or eating lunch. Is it all right to start counting time at a call near home and then travel a long distance to your territory? Can w’e start counting time by writing letters at home and then continue to count time thereafter w’hile going to meet w’ith </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> group for service? Other similar inquiries have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An attempt to lay down rules is not practical, since circumstances vary in every case. All can be guided by the instruction to report “time spent in the activity of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making, proclaiming God’s truths to those who are not dedicated, baptized Witnesses.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Organization </span><span class="font8">book, p. 126) After w’e get started, w<sup>r</sup>e may include time in getting from one house to another as we make our calls, and we may count the time whether householders are at home and willing to listen or not; our reason for calling is to preach. When some question arises, ask yourself: Has this time been spent in the preaching activity? Or, has it been spent doing something else that is not actually part of that w’ork? Report all the time you conscientiously feel w<sup>T</sup>as used in the preaching work. The amount you report in comparison with others is not important. (Gal. 6:4) The important thing is that the love in your heart has moved you to share your faith with others. (Luke 6:45) What w’e report should give us joy and not pangs of conscience. Our concern should be about results accomplished and not reports made about it. Our giving should come from a cheerful heart and not just a sense of obligation. (2 Cor. 9:7) With each one being guided by his own conscience and a balanced viewpoint of the Scriptures, reports made to the congregation will reflect, not “acts of eyeservice,” but good works motivated by a sincere heart.—Col. 3:22.</span></p>

Older brother and sister chat informally with a group of teen-agers. Several teen-agers make expressions that reflect an impulsive, unbalanced view’ of popular pastimes. Discussion helps all to see the lack of wisdom and bad consequences from cultivating such interests. Comments stress logic, reasonableness without laying down rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Distributing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News. </span><span class="font8">Emphasize ten-day distribution; discuss arrangements for group work, handling of territory; encourage sharing extra tracts w’ith other publishers so that all are distributed. Include demonstration show’ing how to offer the tract briefly.

(Ps. 98:1, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NE)</span><span class="font8"> Talk on theme for November. Stress reasons why w’e can have confidence in the following: Jehovah will protect his people as a group during the coming “great tribulation.” Not just a few’ of God's servants, but a “great crowd” w’ill survive. (Rev. 7:9, 14) In determining who of mankind will survive, God w’ill judge righteously; Jehovah’s way of handling matters is always the best way. (Deut. 32:4; Matt. 25:31-33) Guidance now provided by the “slave” is Jehovah's provision. (Matt. 24:45-47) Now is the time to be busy in the work that God has given us to do; our faith, patience and industriousness will be richly rewarded.—1 Cor. 15:58; Heb. 6:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Get expressions from audience (selected, in part, in advance) about effects of the tw’o special service meetings in September. After sober thinking on the matters discussed, have some taken steps tow’ard a more firm stand for the truth? Have some felt the need to be more zealous in the field service? Is there a greater feeling of urgency? Encourage all to be loyal, wholehearted. Urge all, before next week, to look up scriptures in service meeting outline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Announce special public talk for this week, encouraging all to attend, bringing new’ book and Bible. Remind that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Years</span><span class="font8"> book should be completed at book studies by end of November. Song 67.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font8">Now Is the Time to Decide. (Audience discussion) It is reasonable to expect that w<sup>r</sup>e w’ill encounter critical situations in the near future where we may suddenly be compelled to make weighty decisions with far-reaching effects. Indecisiveness could be disastrous. (Jas. 1:6-8) The training now being provided by Jehovah helps us clearly to “distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) NOW is the time to anticipate issues that may arise, consider the factors involved and decide w’hat w’e are going to do. If we give no thought to such matters until they confront us, the pressures and uncertainties of the moment may overwhelm us w’ith dire consequences. The following are some critical situations that w’e should already have considered and made a decision as to what course we will follow’. Invite audience to comment on how they view’ the following matters and why: (1) Relatives may threaten to disown you because of your faith. (Matt. 10:35-39; Mark 10:29, 30) (2) Facing the loss of much materially, perhaps due to bad economic situation. (Hab. 3:17, 18) (3) Being subjected to arrest or imprisonment as a Christian. (Matt. 10:18, 19; Rev. 2:10) (4) Having to endure physical hardships in connection w’ith persecution. (Job 2:5; 1 Pet. 2:20; 2 Cor. 11:23-27) (5) Preaching work banned; meetings forbidden. (Acts 5:28, 29) (6) Pressure to give support to a worldly government. (Luke 4:5-8; Jas. 4:4) (7) Sudden temptation to immoral conduct. (1 Cor. 6:9, 10) (8) Confronted w’ith demand to salute a flag. (Dan. 3:16-18) (9) Enticed by some worldly attraction. (1 John 2: 15-17) (10) Temptation to retaliate for mistreatment or opposition. (Rom. 12: 17-20) (11) Being urged by someone to ignore counsel from elders. (Heb. 13:17) (12) What if some former brothers turned rebellious? (1 Tim. 4:1, 16) (13) What if your own life is endangered by opposers? (2 Cor. 1:8-10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Advance knowledge lovingly provided by Jehovah can help us to make future decisions right now and avoid a w’rong course. (2 Pet. 3:17) A firm resolve to be guided by God’s Word can give us the courage we need to face w’hatever the future may bring.—Prov. 3:5, 6.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word says much about proper use of the tongue. (Jas. 3:1-10) While many situations require restraining the tongue from speaking altogether, there definitely is a “time to speak,” a time when well-chosen words are “as apples of gold in silver carvings.” (Eccl. 3:7; Prov. 25:11) A good word from the “tongue of the wise ones is a healing,” a sharp contrast to thoughtless, inconsiderate babbling.—Prov. 12:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Of course, as imperfect humans we all sin with our tongue or may in other ways offend fellow believers. (Jas. 3:2; 1 John 1:8) Appreciating that we are in need of forgiveness should certainly cause us to be merciful with our brothers, not making issues of minor matters. However, if a person is really troubled and simply cannot put a certain minor offense out of mind and heart, he would not improve the situation by refusing to talk to the offender. Such silence might breed suspicion and distrust, widening the breach that already exists. On the other hand, a few minutes of understanding conversation may put an end to long-standing grievances.—Matt. 5:23, 24; Eph. 4:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Kind words not only contribute much toward improving relationships but also serve to encourage and to build others up. Do we not all experience discouragement? The old system exerts tremendous pressure upon us. It is becoming more difficult to make a living. Surely, then, we benefit from the encouraging word of a thoughtful friend.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Especially when our thoughts and meditations center on spiritual things will our conversations be upbuilding. (Phil. 4:8) An added blessing that results therefrom is that spiritual things are impressed more deeply upon our minds and hearts. And do we not have many good things to talk about? These might be outstanding points we have read in the Watch Tower publications, Biblical passages that particularly impressed us while doing personal study, or things called to our attention at congregational meetings. An encouraging experience can also “impart what is favorable to the hearers.”—Eph. 4:29.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> There are times when it requires courage to make good use of the tongue. Especially is this the case when someone close to us becomes guilty of serious wrongdoing and simply tries to conceal it. Strong emotional feelings may weigh heavily upon us, causing us to want to refrain from speaking to the elders about the matter. But it would really be a distorted sense of loyalty if we were to pass over the serious wrongdoing of someone else.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of us attended an assembly during the month, yet a fine effort in the service resulted in the distribution of 1,116,444 books. That exceeded last July's report by more than 320,000!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several congregations, along with 98 temporary special pioneers, were busy in unassigned territory, making sure people in those areas hear the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The number baptized was 12,997, bringing the 11-month total to 76,566. That is 20,991 above last year’s total! In a marvelous way, we see Jehovah “Increasing the Wealth of Earth’s New King”!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">hardened in a course of sin. Furthermore, we would be showing a lack of concern for the cleanness of the congregation, exposing it to reproach. We could actually be denying our claim of loyalty to Jehovah and his law, possibly endangering our own standing before him. So, while it might be difficult to speak out, would it not be the right and beneficial course for all concerned?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> No question about it, communication at the right time is vital in preserving the peace and harmony of the congregation. That is why elders should rightly be concerned about setting a fine example in this respect when caring for their responsibilities. In matters that have a considerable effect on people’s lives, an elder acts with insight when he does not make a decision on his own but consults fellow elders. As Proverbs 15:22 says: “There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk, but in the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment.” Elders who appreciate this do not limit discussions to their four meetings a year but take time to consult one another about problems and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> From November 1 to 10 it will be our privilege to distribute </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 19, which features a question that millions of people are asking: “Is This All There Is to Life?” The message that it contains is warm, appealing. Once you have read it, you will want others to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Work together as a congregation to see that all the tracts get into the hands of the public. About 100 for each publisher have been shipped to your congregation. Some of you may be able to distribute more; some, less. By united effort, endeavor to get all of them out by November 10. Perhaps some who are attending the meetings have never shared in the field service but would like to have a part in this work. If so, we encourage them to make this known to one of the elders before November. The elder will gladly discuss with them what is needed to qualify-</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> By zealously sharing in making known the “good news” we demonstrate our devotion to Jehovah, also our love for our fellowmen. Lives are involved. May willing hearts move us to share to the full in the work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Included among the many good things we rejoiced to receive at the “Divine Purpose” assembly was the fascinating new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good.</span><span class="font10"> We will waste no time in putting it to good use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First, if we have not yet done so, it would be good to read it ourselves. It contains spiritual food that will strengthen us. To help us digest it, the public talks during November will highlight important points to remember. This will be followed by a page-by-page consideration at the book studies starting December 1. In the meantime, carry copies with you, offering it to neighbors, workmates and others that you contact in your daily routine. Make sure that interested ones previously contacted are offered a copy, along with encouragement to attend the public talks. It is recommended that, after we distribute </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 19, we return to the same territory with the new book. Many who read the tract may be glad to get more information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What about a presentation to use in offering the book? If you wish, you may continue using the sermon “Does God Care?” which</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Occasionally, when the elders meet, mention may be made of a brother or sister who in some way is failing to set a good example. Perhaps a decision is made not to use the person for demonstrations in the service meeting nor to appoint him or her as a temporary pioneer, or the like. When that is the case, the person would be benefited if the elders tried to help that one to become a better example. A failure to communicate could give rise to feelings of resentment or discouragement. Love should prompt such shepherds to give needed aid.</span></p>

May all of us work hard to follow these, thereby contributing to the joy and upbuilding of our brothers. was suggested for use with the subscription offer during October. This theme is certainly appropriate, since God’s determination to carry out his eternal purpose is convincing proof that he cares a great deal for us. The very first chapter assures us that “We Are Within the Purpose of a Loving Creator.” You could also refer to page 186, paragraph 42, where pointed comments are made on the texts in that sermon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> You may prefer to ask a thought-provoking question and then refer to a scripture quoted in the book that provides the answer. For example: “Human plans are all failing. Can we trust God to succeed in fulfilling his purpose?” (Page 24, par. 38; read Psalm 33:9-12.) “Many say that God has abandoned this earth. Does he still have a worthwhile purpose toward this earth that will be fulfilled?” (Page 35, par. 16; read Isaiah 45:18.) “Human governments seem to be helpless in coping with world problems. Is there any government that God will use to bring lasting peace?” —Page 127, par. 18: read Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If you want a brief presentation, you could turn to the illustration on page 4 and say: “God has an eternal purpose that will soon bring cause for much happiness to people in all nations. This book surveys that special purpose from its beginning and shows how you can be among those privileged ito enjoy its blessings.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>G</sup> You are sure to get other ideas about offering the book as you use it during the month and pay close attention to the public talks. Its contents provide an insight into the immediate future that is presently of great interest to many sincere people. Be alert to opportunities to start studies with those who show a desire to learn more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Distribution of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font10">No. 19 will be our first objective during the early part of November, but as soon as your supply of tracts is exhausted or your territory is covered, concentrate on book distribution during the balance of the month. Many honest-hearted people will be comforted by this faith-strengthening explanation of God’s eternal purpose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• How can we get help to solve a personal problem ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is real satisfaction in being able to solve our own problems with the help of God’s Word. Many find they can successfully resolve most personal difficulties through prayer and personal study of the Bible. Better than anyone else, Jehovah knows our problems and invites us to come to him for help. (Heb. 4:16; Jas. 1:2-5: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘ Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> July 1, 1974, pp. 414, 415) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower Publications Index </span><span class="font8">can be used to locate material that deals with specific problems and the Bible counsel that applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After<sup>-</sup> following the above suggestions, if you still feel the need for assistance, then talk to one of the elders in your congregation. These brothers know you and your circumstances; they are usually in a good position to offer the counsel you need from God’s Word. Remember, the elder arrangement is Jehovah’s provision lor giving spiritual assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the problem persists and you have good reason to feel that you need further help, you may write to the Society. If you decide to write, we suggest that you do the following: Identify yourself. your congregation and any other persons directly involved. Anonymous letters are never answered. Do not inquire about hypothetical situations. State things accurately, avoiding conjecture and unrelated details. Provide complete information, clearly stating the nature of your problem. Relate what you have done so far to solve it and why you feed that you have been unsuccessful. An effort will be made to point out the Bible principles that apply. If you write about counsel given by the ciders, it would be good to provide them a copy of your letter. When others are involved, the Society may send a copy of its reply to the elders so that they will know what advice has been given.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">MAY 1974 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Although tho fig tree itself may not blossom, ... I will exult in Jehovah himself.”—Hab. 3:17, 18. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">VOL. XVII NO. 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Q)ea/i ^Kingdom ^Pubftslte/ts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are very much aware of the rapid growth in the size and number of our congregations. Everywhere, it seems, new Kingdom Halls are being built, and in many cases these soon become overcrowded. It is as foretold: Jehovah is ‘speeding up’ the ingathering in this time of the end.—Isa. 60:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another evidence of this organizational growth is the recent purchase and remodeling of an old synagogue, with a seating capacity of 1,200, here in New York city. It is the second circuit assembly hall in this city, serving its share of the more than 260 congregations in the metropolitan area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Global expansion of the Kingdom work in more than 200 countries has created a tremendous demand on the Bethel family for more and more literature. To cope with the demand, Brother Knorr wrote you in February inviting more young single brothers to apply for Bethel service. So far, more than 900 have written in for applications! What a wonderful demonstration of loyalty on the part of God’s people—to ‘offer themselves willingly for Jehovah’s service’! The opportunity to volunteer is still open; more workers are regularly needed.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To accommodate the anticipated increase in personnel of the Bethel family, it has been necessary to reduce the size of the Gilead School. So the present class, No. 57, is only about half the size of previous classes in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Meanwhile, the construction at Watchtower Farm is moving ahead at full speed. All indications are that by the end of 1974 the new factory building will be completed, considerably ahead of the original estimated date. For some time now, ten rotary presses in a finished portion of the Farm factory have been printing most of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines for this country, permitting an increase in the bound book production here in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Show Loyalty to Our God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In following up tract distribution and in offering Thousand Years book</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our distribution of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 18, scheduled to be completed by May 12, is a token of our loyalty to Jehovah. How? Though it is a quickly completed work, quite different from our usual approach to the people, we do it because we realize that our God Jehovah knows the minds of men, and through his servants on : earth he presents the message that is needed, and at the time when it will be most effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Loyalty involves sticking closely in devotion to our Sovereign God. Those who have distributed </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> recognize that we must stand loyally by the message delivered. Therefore we return to these people to back up what has been said. We want to cultivate any interest raised by </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News—</span><span class="font12">to follow through so that it will achieve fully its desired effectiveness. This is also loyalty to our commission to help the people who are “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” We feel an attachment to them and want to lead them to the place of safety.—Matt. 9:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> An excellent way of expressing our loyalty, both to God and to the spiritually needy people, is by offering them the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.</span><span class="font12"> This we will do in May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What has particularly appealed to you in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Years </span><span class="font12">book? It provides the finest view of what the thousand-year reign will do for mankind. We can actually be most enthusiastic about the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">So let us look to Jehovah for greater expansion in the future, and let us pray that he continues to bless those remaining loyal down to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brothers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font12">points that interest us. Select some of these that you find most attractive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In presenting the book some publishers have been simply showing householders the title and telling them that the Kingdom for which they have long prayed has approached and that they will be encouraged by reading the book. These brothers and sisters have been having excellent success. Others have read to the householder the first paragraph in chapter one and the first sentence of paragraph 3 and in this way have aroused their interest. What have you found to be an appealing way to present the book?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>0</sup> Some have first read Isaiah 11: 6-9, then have directed the householder’s attention to the first sentence in paragraph 12 on page 144, which says: “In accordance with this, we can look for the charming description of animal life as set out in Isaiah 11:6-9 to have a literal fulfillment with the birds, fishes and land creatures of earth during the millennial reign of the Prince of Peace.” Of course, you will undoubtedly try various presentations, according to the thinking of people in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Years</span><span class="font12"> book impresses us with the loyalty that God has manifested over six thousand years of time. (Rev. 15:4) He has never deviated from his promise to bless mankind through the Seed, even though mankind has been disloyal and at this time expresses no loyalty at all toward him. God’s loyalty inspires loyalty, however, in his faithful servants today. The final paragraph of the book forcefully expresses our inmost thoughts. After remarking on the unparalleled blessing the approaching thousand years will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font10">20 min: “What Protection for God’s People?” This can be a discussion between one or two elders and one or two publishers who are concerned about Jehovah’s protecting us during the “great tribulation.” Use material in March 15, 1974, issue of “The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Elders will want to point out the issue involved and that, in the case of Job, it included ‘touching his bone and his flesh’ to determine if he served God out of love or was prompted by selfish considerations. Yes, Satan challenged, “Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” Now the question is, Do we consider it a privilege to share in the vindication of God’s name even if it causes us physical suffering, even if it costs us our lives? God will never permit the adversary to wipe out all of Ilis <sup>1 </sup>people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What about God’s preservation of the three Hebrews?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Consider why some of God’s people may die during the “great tribulation.” it is because of the hatred of Satan’s organization for true worship. See the ' prophecy at Ezekiel 38:15, 16. It may be from physical hardships, the strain of which are too much for some to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There will be survivors. Not a single one of Jehovah’s people will perish at the hands of Jehovah’s executional forces. Jehovah knows how to reward his people in a manner that is beyond their fondest expectations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 21. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Gaining Personal Benefit from Jonah’s Way of Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jonah probably lived during the ninth century B.C.E. He lived through the experience about which he wrote. The book that he wrote is the only one in the Hebrew Scriptures dealing exclusively with a prophetic message from Jehovah to a non-Israelite city whose people actually repented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Invite the brothers to open their Bibles to the book of Jonah. Draw them out with the following questions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. According to Jonah 1:1, 2 what was Jonah’s assignment from Jehovah, and what problems did it present to him? According to verse 3, w’hat was Jonah’s reaction to the assignment?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THIS? Accept assignments of service willingly and try, with Jehovah’s help, to carry them out without grumbling, finding fault or running aw’ay from them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. When Jonah fled from his assignment, what did Jehovah do, according to verse 4? What happened after the ship’s crew hurled Jonah into the sea? (1:15-17) What evidence do we have that Jonah recognized that he had followed a wrong course? (2:1, 7, 9) How do we know that Jehovah heard Jonah’s prayer and showed mercy? (2:10)</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THIS? When w<sup>r</sup>e show sincere repentance for past -wrongdoing and ask Jehovah for help, he grants it. We should be careful that we do not accept his undeserved kindness and miss its purpose.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">3. What command did Jehovah restate to Jonah? (3:1, 2) What did Jonah now do? (3:3, 4) What were the results? (3:5-9) What was God’s reaction? (3:10) How did Jonah feel about the mercy God extended? (4:1-3, 5) WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THIS? Do not feel, like Jonah did at first, that Jehovah owes it to us to do a certain thing. Jehovah did not have to destroy the people of Nineveh just because Jonah preached that message. We should not feel that those to whom we preach should receive an adverse judgment because of their reaction to the message we bring; rather, we should wait on Jehovah and hope the best for them. There may be a change of heart and repentance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">At one time we did not think that so many -would be coming back in the resurrection, but there is no reason to be displeased at Jehovah’s mercy; rather, we rejoice that judgment decisions are in the hands of Jehovah and his Son.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">4. What added blessing did Jehovah \ give Jonah? (4:6) What happened to interfere with Jonah’s comfort? (4:7, 8) What fitting comparison did Jehovah make? (4:10, 111</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THIS? Never lack in appreciation for the undeserved kindness Jehovah shows us. Rejoice also when mercy is extended to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The account reveals that Jonah proved to be a faithful servant of Jehovah. He was candid, honest, even writing about his own attitude and Jehovah’s dealings with him. Remember the account and benefit personally from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">17 min: Getting Acquainted with Our Brothers. Interview’ a number of publishers to bring out points that will be encouraging to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Interview’ some who are newly associated with the congregation. What did you notice about Jehovah’s organization that attracted you to it? What have you come to appreciate about it now’? Why is it that you arrange to get to meetings regularly? What w’ould you do if family members or relatives started to oppose you or ridicule the truth? (Encourage tact.) What have you done to share the truth with your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">friends, neighbors and relatives? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Interview’ publishers who have been » i with the organization for a number of / W years. Why have you stuck with the / 0 truth? Why do you keep going from-*\ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(J </span><span class="font10">door to door? As you see this old , ;) system of things continue to deterio-rate, how does it strike you? Have , you seen cases w’here brothers show’ed ■ 4 * tact, kindness and love toward family U-members not in the truth and it w’orked out well? With Jehovah’s help, what are your plans for the future? Do you have a favorite scripture that encourages or strengthens you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: Concluding comments. Draw’ ' attention to some of the introductions mentioned in “Presenting the Good News.” Encouarge brothers to read and use the suggestions they find most appropriate.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HOW ARE YOU USING YOUR LIFE?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font13">S IT not apparent that most of mankind are living their lives for themselves? They are using their lives as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font13"> see lit, without concern for others. But what about us? The apostle Paul wrote to fellow servants of Jehovah, saying: “None of us, in fact, lives with regard to himself only, and no one dies with regard to himself only; for both if we live, we live to Jehovah, and if we die, we die to Jehovah. Therefore both if we live and if we die, we belong to Jehovah.”—Rom. 14:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This is something for all of us to give serious thought to: It would be entirely inappropriate for us, while professing to be Jehovah’s people, to try to live our lives with regard to ourselves only. As the apostle Paul wrote: “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price. By all means, glorify God.”—1 Cor. 6:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Are we not thankful that Jehovah God has purchased us and that we now belong to Him? He has bought us with the life of his own dear Son so that eternal death does not have to be our lot, but we have before us the opportunity to enjoy everlasting life. (John 3:16, 36) How are you affected by this loving provision of God? Does it not cause you to want to show Jehovah your deep appreciation? The apostle Peter noted that if we have the proper mental disposition we will be moved to “live the remainder of four] time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">but for God’s will.”—</span><span class="font13">1 Pet. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Is that what you are doing? Are you living no longer simply to satisfy personal ambitions or desires, but to do God’s will? Are there ways in which you could share more fully in doing the will of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Will for Us</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah makes clear in his Word that his will for us today includes accomplishing a great work of Kingdom-preaching before the end of this system comes. (Matt. 24:14) Jesus Christ did a similar work. He said: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">because for this I was sent forth.”</span><span class="font13">—Luke 4:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jesus did not hold back, but was whole-souled in his service to God. When we read the historical accounts of his ministry in the Gospels, how impressed we are with his energy and zeal in doing the Kingdom-preaching! Jesus knew that he had only a short time, and he did not spare himself in finishing his assignment. Should we not today be imitating his example, especially since we have such a short time left now in which to complete the Kingdom-preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, the end of this system is so very near! Is that not reason to increase our activity? In this regard we can learn something from a runner who puts on a final burst of speed near the finish of a race. Look at Jesus, who apparently stepped up his activity during his final days on earth. In fact, over 27 percent of the material in the Gospels is devoted to just the last week of Jesus’ earthly ministry!—Matt. 21:1-27:50; Mark 11:1-15: 37; Luke 19:29-23:46; John 11:55-19:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By carefully and prayerfully examining our own circumstances, we also may find that we can spend more time and energy in preaching during this final period before the present system ends. Many of our brothers and sisters are doing just that. This is evident from the rapidly increasing number of pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, since the summer of 1973 there have been new peaks in pioneers every month. Now there are 20,394 regular and special pioneers in the United States, an all-time peak. That is 5,190 more than there were in February 1973! A 34-percent increase! Does that not w<sup>7</sup>arm our hearts? Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world’s end.—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Circumstances such as poor health or responsibilities in connection with your family may limit what you can do in the field ministry. And yet, the pioneer ranks include many who have health limitations, as well as some persons with families. But these brothers and sisters are able to regulate their lives so that they can care for their responsibilities and still put in the 1,200 hours a year, an average of 100 hours a month in the field ministry, required of pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Therefore, do not be too quick to dismiss the possibility that you, too, may be able to pioneer. Give it careful and prayerful consideration. Perhaps an analysis will reveal that your life is encumbered with needless weights that can be put off so that you can pioneer. Particularly may this be the case if you are single, or are married but have no children.—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So, then, ask yourself: How am I using my life? Can I make adjustments that will enable me to pioneer? If I can, will failure to do so indicate to Jehovah that I am living to satisfy personal desires, rather than to do His will? Every one of us wants to be able to say, as did the apostle Paul, “Indeed, the life that I now live in flesh I live by the faith that is toward the Son of God, who loved me and handed himself over for me. I do not shove aside the undeserved kindness of God.” —Gal. 2:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Real blessings await those who can adjust their affairs to pioneer. First, there is a certain added contentment in sharing full time in the preaching work that God purposes all his servants now<sup>r</sup> to do. Pioneering enlarges your opportunity to “save” yet scattered prospective members of the “great crowd.” (1 Tim. 4:16; Rev. 7:9, 14) Also, there may open up to you the privilege of being sent as a special pioneer into territory that is not often worked. And for those pioneering, there is the possibility of the opportunity of training at Gilead School and then going on to foreign missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So do not delay in giving serious consideration to this matter of how you are using your life. See if you can arrange your affairs to pioneer. Why not discuss the matter with persons already pioneering or with elders in your congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As you probably are aware, to qualify as a regular pioneer you should have been baptized for at least six months, and have participated in the field service each month for the past six months. Also, it is vital that you have a reputation for fine Christian conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Need at Bethel</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is another opportunity of service that we would also like you to consider seriously. And that is Bethel service. Most of you know something about Bethel. It is where this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> as well as the literature that you use in Kingdompreaching, is produced. At Bethel, both at Brooklyn and at Watchtower Farm, we are able to produce publications for your use at a very reasonable cost, which we are sure that you very much appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Perhaps, though, you have little idea of the amount of literature now required. For example, from September to February over 21,500,000 bound books and Bibles were made here at Bethel—over 200,000 on some days! And yet in these six months, orders for 33 million more books were received! So right now there are orders from throughout the world for over 35 million books and Bibles! The supplies of most of the branches are very low. And all of this despite the fact that for months now about 75 brothers have been running many of the bindery machines on an all-night shift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But besides books, at Brooklyn and at Watchtower Farm we are also printing an average of more than 21 million magazines a month, about 900,000 every working day. These all have to be wrapped and mailed to people all over the world. About 1,000 persons are required to operate the factories. They work at proofreading, typesetting, plate-making, operating presses, making ink and glue, running bindery machines, and so forth. Hundreds of others raise the food, cook the meals, do the laundry, care for the homes, work in offices; others are building another factory for enlarged printing operations. All together, including the 76 Gilead and Kingdom Ministry School students, some 1,800 persons live and work at the Society’s headquarters. Over 400 of these persons work at the new facilities called Watchtower Farm located north of New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As you can appreciate, the growth of the preaching work requires many workers at Bethel. Also, there is the continual need to replace those who each year find it necessary to leave. Thus, during 1973 some 360 new workers were called in to the headquarters staff. Presently we are increasing the night shift in the bindery, and to do this the many needed workers were called to Bethel, over one hundred single brothers. So you see why we wanted to bring to your attention the opportunity of Bethel service. We expect that between May and September one hundred more single young brothers will be called to Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, not everyone is able to work here. Most of the work here is physically hard—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">work for healthy young men.</span><span class="font13"> So at present, sisters or married couples are not being invited. But if you are a single brother between 18 and 35 years of age, in good health and baptized for more than one year, we encourage you to consider Bethel service. You may obtain an application by writing to the President’s Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A Service to Be Treasured</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is true, there is an inclination in the world today to look down upon and to shy away from physical labor. But the Bible does not take this view. In fact, the apostle Paul admonished a person: “Let him do hard work, doing with his hands what is good work, that he may have something to distribute to someone in need.”—Eph. 4:28; 1 Thess. 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At Bethel we are probably in a better position to provide things for distribution to those in need than are any other people in the world. As a Bethelite of fourteen years said: “I really feel like I’m serving my brothers here. I feel like I’m constantly involved in giving, rather than being concerned with my own problems.” Such giving can bring genuine contentment and happiness, even as Jesus Christ himself said. (Acts 20:35) Would you like to serve Jehovah God and your Christian brothers wholeheartedly in this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Perhaps, though, you have reservations. Some who have been at Bethel may have told you that life here is routine and much of the work is monotonous. But do not many persons say the same thing about life and work wherever they are? Thus a brother who has served for thirty-eight years at Bethel noted: “Attitude has a lot to do with it. You have routine anywhere. I’d rather have routine among pleasant circumstances than unpleasant.” Another long-time Bethelite observed: “I appreciate the routine and the schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Actually a good routine helps you to get a lot done. And do we not want to do as much as we can to further the worldwide preaching work in the short time remaining? A brother, who has been at Bethel with his wife for eighteen years, explained his feelings: “We have pioneered and done circuit and district work, and I can say that you can do the greatest good with your waking hours here at Bethel. You are </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">totally consumed.</span><span class="font13"> We realize it is not Utopia, but our biggest motivation is that we want to have the fullest share in getting the preaching work done.” Do you, too, strongly desire to have the fullest share in furthering the Kingdompreaching? If so, Bethel may well be the place for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yet, you may still wonder: Is not working long hours on certain factory jobs monotonous? It does not have to be. Monotony is largely a state of mind. If a person at Bethel keeps his mind focused on the fact that what he is doing is pleasing to Jehovah and is serving to spread the Kingdom message, then the work is truly satisfying. That is how hundreds of brothers who have served for many years at Bethel feel about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One might note certain similarities between Bethel service and the work done by those Levites privileged to serve long ago at Jehovah’s temple. Much of their work was hard and unglamorous, even what some might consider monotonous. Yet it was vital to Jehovah’s worship. It had to do with watchman duties, dining-room service, butchering animals and preparing food, and so forth—types of work similar to what is presently done by many here at Bethel. (1 Chron. 9:26-32) For example, there are some 35 full-time preparers of the food at Bethel, and about 30 waiters in the dining rooms. But what a privilege to do this kind of hard work at the center of Jehovah’s earthly organization!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When we consider what Jehovah has done for us through Jesus Christ, should we not be moved to do whatever we can to accomplish God’s will? As the apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “For the love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have judged, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died; and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.” (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) Are you living no longer for yourself, but to do Jehovah’s will? If so, you will be eager to do whatever at the present time appears to be God’s will for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In this connection, it is important to have a proper view of God’s will for his people. Do not expect that God’s will for his servants is necessarily easy. Was it easy, for example, for Noah and his family to work day in and day out, year after year, building the ark for as long as presently would be called a lifetime? Was it easy for Nehemiah and his companions to complete the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls? Is it easy today to preach the good news in lands where the work is banned, thus risking imprisonment and perhaps death? And yet these activities have been, at various times, God’s will for his people. At all times Jehovah’s servants have found pleasure in doing God’s will, and so offer themselves willingly to do what needs to be done.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When a young brother volunteers for Bethel service, fine opportunities and grand blessings are opened up to him. The satisfaction of helping to produce literature that is assisting thousands of persons </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">every week</span><span class="font13"> to dedicate their lives to Jehovah is only part of it. In addition, there is the privilege of associating with many older ones of the anointed class and hearing at the breakfast table their comments on the daily text. Also, reports are frequently heard by representatives of the Society when they return from traveling abroad. Missionary students, too, tell about the preaching work in their territories, and during their months at school Bethelites are able to visit with them and get acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Also, each member of the Bethel family attends the meetings and works in the field ministry with a local congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses, of which there are now 235 in New York city. This is a real joy, as a brother at Bethel for thirteen years observes: “The New York congregations are a spiritual paradise with great interest in the Kingdom. The people here see the urgency!” One Bethel sister noted: “I have helped as many people to find the truth since I have been at Bethel, five in fact, as I did when pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Perhaps the greatest blessing, however, is living and working all day long only with persons who truly love Jehovah. This is what so many at Bethel especially treasure. As one member said: “Others visit Bethel for a day, and feel uplifted. We have that blessing every day.” If you qualify to come to Bethel, we feel that you, too, will find it a service to be treasured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Encourage Others to Full-Time Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Perhaps, though, you are not able to engage in the full-time service as a pioneer or at Bethel, because of having a family to support or due to old age and poor health. Why not, then, urge others, especially the younger ones, to seize hold of such special privileges? Help others to analyze their goals in life. Ask them what they are going to do when they graduate from school? Reason with them to see that the dying old world has nothing to offer. Help them to show Jehovah that they truly appreciate his undeserved kindness by volunteering to serve where his organization needs them the most, especially ‘in the days of their young manhood.’ Help those who now qualify for Bethel service to say, in effect, “Here I am! Send me,” by filling out and sending in their application.—Eccl. 12:1; Isa. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you are an elder in the congregation, do not simply talk about these matters from the platform, but, as opportunity affords, talk to the young brothers personally. Parents, why not regularly keep the treasure of pioneering and Bethel service before your children? Many now at Bethel are so happy that they were encouraged in this direction. One Bethelite, who has served now for nearly two decades at Bethel, notes: “Often a group from Bethel would come out to my family’s farm and we would get together and tell experiences. They built in me an appreciation of Bethel. Even before I came I knew of the happinesses of Bethel life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Truly, using our lives in any way possible in Jehovah’s service brings a measure of happiness. We have so much to live for—an eternity of blessings while serving Jehovah. Surely we are all grateful for His making this possible by the sacrifice of His dear Son. Let us all, therefore, show our heartfelt appreciation by the way that we use our lives. Let us prove that we are no longer living for ourselves, but to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Would You Be \</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How? you ask. Well, first let us consider some facts with you and you will no doubt see for yourself how you might help. You were thrilled to learn that during the past service year 193,990 were baptized the world around, weren’t you? Yes, we all were. Did you know that 55,775 of those baptized were here in the United States? Have you heard that during the first six months of this service year another 31,579 disciples have been baptized here? And do you remember that during December, when we distributed </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News, </span><span class="font12">525,007 shared in the witness work, and that that was 103,112 more than shared in the field service in this country one year previously? Yes, there are many, many new ones associated with us in serving Jehovah. What joy this brings us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now, can you think of ways you might help these new ones? Some have shared in the field service just a few times. They may not feel strong enough to take the initiative to go out by themselves. Are there some in your congregation who would share in the field service more regularly if they had someone with whom to work—if you invited them to go along with you? (EccL 4:9, 10) Take the initiative in extending the invitation regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers enjoyed offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> to people but do not feel they can make other presentations in the house-to-house work. Could you help one of these to prepare a magazine presentation? Would you be willing to practice it with him until he feels at ease with it? Or you might help him to prepare a one-scripture presentation to use in the regular house-to-house work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> New publishers may feel disappointed when some householders choose not to listen to them. But it is good to call to mind what Jehovah told Jeremiah: “And you must speak to them all these words,” but he also told him, “they will not listen to you.” Show them that verse at Jeremiah 7:27. It may be very encouraging to them to learn that their success in the field ministry is not measured by how many persons listen to them. While many do not listen to our presentations, there are many who do and there are many more who observe us. When we are in the service, the angels see us, Jehovah and Jesus see us, and so do the people in the territory. So our presence there and the few words we do speak about Jehovah and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">his kingdom can be a fine witness and a great honor to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> On the other hand, many who do not choose to speak to us at length may feel they are too busy to talk. In parting, new publishers could easily extend a handbill and invite the householder to the Kingdom Hall. Some publishers, with reference to the June offer, may tell the householder: ‘If it is not convenient to talk now, perhaps you would like to accept this fine Bible and Bible study aid. They can be yours for a contribution of just $1.25?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Are you one of the newly associated publishers? Then you have tasted the pleasure that comes from serving Jehovah, who gave us the truth as well as all the other things that we enjoy in life. And you have experienced to some extent the happiness that comes from “giving” to others in the witness work. (Acts 20:35) Would you like to have a greater share in the work? Then we encourage you to take the initiative and ask experienced publishers if you may go along with them in the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Whether you have been in Jehovah’s service for many years or are newly associated, will you take the initiative? Will you show your love for Jehovah and for your brothers by helping them to share regularly in his service?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">HOW DID WE DO IN FEBRUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With Jehovah’s blessing', we did very well! There were 198,177 who shared in field service during this winter month. That is the highest number of publishers who have shared in Jehovah’s service in this country in any one month except December, when we were distributing the “Kingdom News.’’ It is 61,718, or 14.1 percent, more than shared in field service last February. It is a fine indication that many who shared with us in the tract work are determined to show their love for Jehovah and for their neighbors by continued activity in Kingdompreaching. It is an indication that you brothers appreciate the love that Jehovah has shown you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And Jehovah blessed you with good results in your activity. You placed 150,067 subscriptions, 9,379,160 magazines and 547,274 books, which is an excellent report. No doubt these publications will aid many who are seeking Jehovah and seeking righteousness.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Publishers or pioneers interested in helping a congregation to cover territory that it has and that has not been worked for at least a year should review the information in the April 1973 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> article “Covering Unworked Territory.”</span></p></li>

Two copies of each of these large expensive books should be enough for such a congregation. When these are placed, order two more. They are cash items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We suggest that the responsible brothers carefully check their records to determine how many copies of these publications moved out of their stock in the past four months. Do not order more than a four-month supply. We do not wish to store these books on the shelves of the congregations if you will not be using them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ If you are planning to attend a convention in another country or want a Kingdom Hall address overseas, it is necessary for you to write the branch office for that country, not the Brooklyn office, to get details. Branch addresses appear in the back of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font10"> If you do not find a particular country or island in the branch listing, you can refer to the service chart in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> to see which branch has jurisdiction and then you may write to that branch office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Introductions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many publishers have said that one of the biggest challenges they face in house-to-house work is catching the interest of the householder, getting a hearing ear —yes, finding an effective introduction. Is this true in your case too?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Notice the suggestion that Jesus made as recorded at Luke 10:5. He said: “Wherever you enter into a house say first, ‘May this house have peace.’ ” While this is a greeting that is not common among people in this country today, yet it gives us an idea as to how we might introduce ourselves and begin conversations. How? By identifying ourselves as friends and by featuring something encouraging, something that may bring peace of mind to the householder. You might say: “I’m very glad I found you at home. I have brought something that I’d like to share with you and I hope it will make today one of the happiest days of the year for you.” Does that sound like a warm and encouraging way to start a conversation? flow about your introduction? Will it tell the householder that you have come in peace and to bring a good message to him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Would you like to know how some of your brothers are introducing themselves with considerable success in various parts of the country?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">INTRODUCTIONS THAT DISPLAY WARMTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers start the conversation by saying: “How are you today? I’ve brought something encouraging for you.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If the householder comes to the door with a smile, one brother says: “It is a pleasure to meet someone with a smile. It shows you are a happy person. Most people today </span><span class="font5">Show Loyalty to Our God! </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{Conf d) </span><span class="font12">bring, the book states: “How worthy that thrilling prospect is of each one’s now putting forth his best efforts to realize it in his own case, in faith and appreciation toward Jehovah God, who holds out the inviting prospect!” True, indeed, and our loyalty will prompt us to do all we can to set this same brilliant prospect before many others as the living hope.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">do not have much to be happy about, do they? ... I have stopped by to add to your happiness.” If the householder has no smile, the brother says: “I have stopped by with something encouraging. When you read the newspaper you don’t read much to be happy about, do you?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Another starts by saying: “I’m one of Jehovah’s witnesses. You may wonder why we are calling again. Well, we have the very best in mind for you; that’s why we came.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">INTRODUCING A SUBJECT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Some publishers have found that if they introduce a subject of interest to the householder, it helps to catch interest. For instance, if a brother notices that a householder may be busy, he says: “Everyone is so busy these days. We often wish we had more time, isn’t that true? Well, I have good news for you. Things are going to change. May I tell you about it?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> Some draw attention to problems that concern the householder, saying: “We would like to get your idea on a problem we have here in the community.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> One brother says: “I’m looking for people who would like to live forever. Have you ever thought of that?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Talk with other brothers and sisters in your area and you may get some good ideas as you learn what has been successful for them. Try different introductions. When you find an effective way to introduce the good news, use it. What will prove effective depends on the interest of people in your territory, the kind of people you talk to, as well as your personality. Keep the matter before Jehovah in prayer. He can help us to improve our effectiveness in reaching people and presenting the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">• Is the school overseer still to give counsel on speech qualities after each student talk?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Yes. As pointed out in the Instructions for the Theocratic Ministry School for 1974: &quot;Specific counsel on each student talk will be given, following the program of progressive counsel outlined at the bottom of the Speech Counsel slip.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The student is informed on his assignment slip what point (s) he is working on, and it is appropriate for the school overseer to give counsel or commendation on how he did. Perhaps the student did very well in applying the suggestions given in the “School Guidebook.” It. is appropriate for the counselor briefly to commend the student for this and he may be able to comment on how the student applied the suggestions and why it is appropriate for him to have developed this speech quality or how it will be useful to him in the field ministry—which comments can be instructive and beneficial for all who are in attendance at the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As noted in the school Instructions for 1974, however, the whole two minutes need not be spent in discussion of speech qualities. In fact, it is appropriate for the emphasis to be placed on spiritual matters. To accomplish this, appropriate comments on important points from material assigned, but not covered by the speakers, can be made. Remarks highlighting the value of the information to us can help to keei&gt; the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. For a good balance on this, I see the suggestions given on page 7 of the December 1972 issue of the “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The school overseer should be careful to use no more than two minutes for his counsel and comments after each student talk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">All of us have reason to he overjoyed about what is taking place in the ranks of Jehovah’s people world w<sup>r</sup>ide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Weren’t you thrilled to learn that 193,990 had symbolized their dedication by water immersion during the 1973 service year? That was the highest number in the history of Jehovah’s servants I And the increase has not slowed down. Already, during the first three months of this service year, Canada, Austria, Brazil, the Philippines and the ■United States have reported tremendous increases in the number baptized, increases exceeding by over 50 percent the outstanding number immersed during the same period last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here in the United States we also had another fine month in the field during November. The largest number to date—18,687-—shared in the regular pioneer work. All together, 478,795 reported field activity—54,-453 more than last November. We were featuring the book God’s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached,</span><span class="font11"> and nearly a million books were placed—986,399 to be exact. A grand witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A few early reports have come in about distribution of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 17. We heard about a priest who held up a copy in church, warning his congregation not to accept it. The result? At least one man eagerly asked a Witness for a copy. In another place, a man who read it called a local Witness promptly and told him that for years as a church member he had been trying to understand the Bible but that now he knew why he was having difficulty; he wanted a home Bible study. What a privilege to have a part in finding and helping such people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These are thrilling times in which to be alive. It is true, there are mounting problems for everyone as the old order deteriorates. But by our keeping in mind what it all means—that the incoming of God’s</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The marvelous prospect of eternal life under the righteous kingdom of God awaits the survivors of the end of this wicked system of things. All of us w<sup>T</sup>ant to be among the survivors, so we need to continue to ‘do our utmost’ to please Jehovah now. This includes helping others of honest heart to learn of our loving Creator and his provisions for salvation.—2 Pet. 3 :14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The desire to ‘do our utmost’ to aid others should move us to be zealous in the field ministry during February, even though, in most parts of the country, the weather is cold and often disagreeable. We can dress warmly, ask householders if we can step in for a few minutes where advisable, work apartments if available and business territory. And, among other things, it is an excellent time to make return visits and start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Well appreciating how the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines have aided us and will help many more, at every opportunity let us offer a year’s subscription. Three booklets are to be given free with each new one-year subscription. Or, if your congregation has a stock of bound books copyrighted in 1961 or earlier, one book may be given free with each new one-year subscription. If the subscription offer is not accepted, endeavor to leave two magazines for 10 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If you have older magazines that have accumulated, it would be well to leave a copy where you find no one at home. (See June 1969 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> “Question Box.”) That people are attracted to the truth of Jehovah’s Word by new order is at hand—we will be helped to keep first the interests of the Kingdom, and we will encourage one another to successful endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our warm love and heartfelt prayers on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">just one magazine,</span><span class="font11"> a publisher wrote: ‘No one was at home, so I left under the door a magazine. The young man who lived there read the magazine and discussed it the next day at work with a man who happened to be a Witness. A Bible study was started with the young man, all from a sample magazine being left under his door.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Have you tried offering both subscriptions for $3.00? A special pioneer reports: ‘I finally convinced myself last month to offer both subscriptions from house to house and on return visits. In one month I obtained 21 subscriptions. Sixteen of the total were double subscriptions.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In doing our utmost, let us also be diligent in making expired-sub-scription calls. During the fourmonth </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign, over 300,000 expired-subscription slips will be sent to congregations in the United States. These return visits are a fine avenue not only for obtaining subscriptions, but also for starting Bible studies. By sharing in this work, perhaps you will be privileged to enjoy an experience like this one: ‘I made a call on a former subscriber and offered her a free home Bible study. The study was started that very day, and within six months, though opposition came from her husband, she was attending almost all meetings. Now she is going out in the field ministry, has the joy of conducting two home Bible studies, and is looking forward to getting baptized at our next circuit assembly.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Why not look in the various places where you may have put expired-subscription slips that you received sometime in the past, and follow through on them now. Also, have you considered making a list of persons on whom you have made return visits, and then encouraging </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Harmonizing Our Employment with love of Neighbor<sup>9</sup></span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">More than eighty years ago the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> magazine (April, 1891) published a letter in which one of its readers told how he had quit the use of tobacco “with the help of the Lord.” Thereafter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font0">on a number of occasions encouraged others also to free themselves from this form of slavery.—Aug. 1, 1895; Nov. 15, 1905; Feb. 1, 1912; Mar. 1, 1935; July 1, 1942; Feb. 15, 1950; Apr. 1, 1954; Feb. 15, 1969; Nov. 1, 1971.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Over the years the light of truth on this subject grew brighter and brighter, until Jehovah’s witnesses saw clearly where Christians today should stand on this issue. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> of June 1, 1973, presented the Scriptural reasons why it is wrong to use tobacco personally and showed that baptized Christians who are tobacco users would be removed from the Christian congregation. Baptized persons who were using tobacco were allowed a reasonable period of time in which to free themselves from the addiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> of July 1, 1973, gave examples of dedicated Christians who, in recognition of the detrimental effects of tobacco on the human family, exercised their conscience in refusing to grow tobacco any longer. It pointed out too how some had quit working for companies that manufacture and distribute cigars, cigarettes and tobacco products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> of November 1973 also contained an article on how tobacco users should be viewed by the Christian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since then a number of questions have been raised concerning the growing, selling and distributing of tobacco and tobacco products in connection with one’s employment. There are some types of employment that are quite clearly in open conflict with the Bible standards. Thus, Jehovah’s witnesses have long refused to recognize as approved members of the congregation persons who make their living at gambling, or by producing idolatrous objects, or who do work that is directly contrary to the ways of peace described at Isaiah 2:4. When one’s work is clearly contrary to Bible standards, it can</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY, FEBRUARY 1974 </span><span class="font0">rightly result in one’s being rejected by the congregation, disfellowshiped. The Bible itself sets the standard or rule that is the basis for such action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> has presented a clear-cut statement showing the damaging effects of tobacco on the body and rightly categorizing it as a harmfully addictive drug. Various governmental authorities have recognized the harmful effects of tobacco but up to now have not outlawed the use of tobacco or its production. The legality of tobacco does not alter the basic wrong involved in producing or selling for gain a product that is harmful to one’s neighbors. To illustrate, a country might declare marijuana legal (even as some states may have legal prostitution), yet the person who made his living from the production or sale of marijuana would still clearly not be a suitable member of God’s congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore, a person who owns a tobacco store, or one who has accepted employment in a factory devoted to producing tobacco products, or a salesman whose business is selling tobacco, or a farmer who controls the raising of crops on his farm and who chooses to raise tobacco should recognize that he has a responsibility for what he is doing. How can his Christian conscience allow him to bring harm to his neighbor when he is in a position to exercise control over what is being done? The brothers should be able to weigh the seriousness of the matter and also weigh the heaviness of the responsibility that individuals have in matters of employment where a wrong practice comes into the picture. There should be no doubt as to the gross wrong on the part of those who gain their principal source of income from promoting the use of tobacco at the expense of the well-being of their fellowman. Such a course is an open contradiction of the basic command to love one’s neighbor as oneself. —Matt. 22:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then there is the person who owns a store and stocks tobacco as a minor item among the many things he sells. He may say he would prefer not to stock it but that his customers demand it, and this may have some basis in fact. He does not feel he is an active promoter of tobacco. Yet, even though his responsibility may be less than that of one whose main means of living is gained from tobacco, what is his reason for acceding to his customers’ demands? Is it not to retain their business and the gain that this brings? Since he is the owner of the store and has control of what is sold there, the responsibility falls directly upon him, and his Christian conscience should move him to dispose of all tobacco stock and not replace it, even though this may result in some financial loss to him. Surely he would be able to adjust his affairs within a reasonable period of time, say three months, and relieve himself of such responsibility, even though suffering some loss, and so be able to continue as a member of the congregation. If a customer inquires why he does not sell tobacco, he can explain that he is being a good neighbor and doing good to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By comparison there may be a Christian who is simply an employee in an establishment that sells tobacco </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">incidentally</span><span class="font0"> and who has no voice or control in what is sold. For example, an employee in a restaurant may be called upon by a customer to sell him a cigar which the management stocks. Or, one may be working in a food market; groceries and meat are the principal products sold, but the owners stock tobacco as an incidental item. The Christian employee may be expected to collect money for items that are sold, including the tobacco. Personal conscience would have to dictate what he or she in this situation could and should do as to handling tobacco products to this extent. He may prefer to ask the employer to relieve him of any handling of these objectionable materials. Unless a serious issue would arise, such employee would not be restricted from serving as a pioneer, an elder or a ministerial servant in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some questions* occur when a store is owned by partners, only one of whom is a baptized Christian, or where a Christian is hired as manager of a place of business, or when working under a franchise arrangement and tobacco is being sold there. The basic consideration in these cases would be whether the Christian has control of the business to the extent that he can stop the handling of tobacco products. In a partnership arrangement the partner or partners who are not in the truth may insist that the sale of tobacco continue there and the Christian may not be able to prevent it. In such cases a Christian desiring a good conscience in the matter may inform the partners that they take full responsibility for the tobacco sales and that he does not wish to receive any share in the profits on sales of tobacco products. If a manager is required by the owner of a business to sell tobacco along with other items, then the Christian will have to determine in his own conscience whether he is able to continue his employment under those circumstances or not. Some may choose to disengage themselves from such businesses. Where continuing, the local elders may ask those individuals to show them that their stocking and selling tobacco in the place of business is not a result of their own choice or decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A person whose employment or principal work is handling, processing, manufacturing or selling tobacco or tobacco products is contributing to the addiction of other persons. If a dedicated, baptized Christian finds himself working in such an objectionable type of employment, he should arrange within a reasonable time, perhaps three months, to find other employment that would not be out of harmony with the requirements of the Scriptures for Christian living. On the other hand, if after such time period he would decide to remain in the objectionable employment, it would be necessary for the congregation to take action and expel the individual from the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Growing tobacco also constitutes being a part of the tobacco industry and is as objectionable as using tobacco personally or making a living by selling tobacco products. A dedicated Christian who owns his own farmland has control over what he will plant and must take responsibility for what his farm produces. As </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> of July 1, 1973, indicated, the Christian conscience should move one to do good toward others. Tobacco does not do good for the human family. Therefore, why should the Christian farmer be involved with the production and sale of a tobacco crop?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States the government has arranged for what are described as “tobacco allotments” for the land that is being farmed in the tobacco-growing areas. A percentage of the land may be used for raising tobacco, or a certain number of pounds of tobacco may be produced under the allotment arrangement. Some have asked what a brother should do when he has a tobacco allotment with his land. He does not have to use it but can grow other crops on his farm. Granted, according to letters received, the greatest income from any crops raised may be from the tobacco crop. If the brother refuses to grow tobacco on his land in the future, it may mean financial loss to him, but at the same time it would mean gaining a good conscience toward God and a good standing with the congregation. (1 Tim. 1:5, 19) In these days of increasing food shortages, a Christian farmer can do good for his neighbors by producing foodstuffs instead of doing injury to them by producing tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are brothers who are renters of land on which there is a tobacco allotment and the same principles would apply. A Christian farmer would avoid any objectionable employment by producing crops other than tobacco or similar addictive drugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If a brother owns land on which there is a tobacco allotment and rents or leases it out, he would not want to become involved in some sharecropping arrangement where he knows beforehand that the renter will produce tobacco on the farm. The same would be true of leasing out one’s tobacco allotment. Surely he would feel a responsibility for knowingly being involved in and gaining money from the production of harmful tobacco. So, to the extent that he has control over the matter, he would want to see that his land which may be rented out for farming would be used for production of crops other than tobacco, if he wishes to continue as a member of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under these circumstances some Christian farmers in tobacco-growing areas may conclude that the only practical course open to them is to go into some other business and to leave farming. They may even decide to sell their land on which the tobacco allotment has been assigned by the government. Would there be any objection to a Christian’s selling his land on which there is a tobacco allotment? There is no reason why the Christian farmer should feel a responsibility for what someone else does with the land after he has sold it. It becomes the responsibility of the new owner and if he chooses to use the tobacco allotment, that would not be the concern of the Christian farmer who sold the land and would not affect his standing with the Christian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of the correspondence indicates that brothers have already signed contracts and given their word that they will be farming certain land and producing tobacco. Some may have already rented their land to someone for the next year or longer. Whether these brothers will be able to cancel or relieve themselves of such contracts in some way is not known, but it will be commendable for them to seek ways to avoid being involved in growing any more tobacco. In some cases it may not be possible for the Christian farmer to terminate a contract on which he has given his word and made a legal agreement. He may have made the arrangement in good faith and without appreciating that what he was doing was really improper for a Christian. In such cases it would seem to be reasonable that the Christian farmer explain his situation to the judicial committee of the congregation, pointing out what he has done to try to relieve himself of the obligation to produce tobacco and showing the committee the signed contract or evidence of the agreement. In such instances the local elders can give consideration to the individual case and do not have to expel the Christian farmer from the congregation if he complies with his word previously given in the contract and fulfills that contract. However, during the time when a contract directly involves a person with tobacco production, it would be inappropriate to use him as a pioneer, an elder or a ministerial servant in the congregation. In his present situation he is not “irreprehensible” or “free from accusation.” (1 Tim. 3:2, 10) But as soon as the contract is finished, if the Christian farmer enters into another contract for growing tobacco, he would be subject to expulsion from the Christian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Inquiries have been received about employment on farms owned by someone else on which tobacco is produced. Here the position would be similar to employment in a worldly company where the Christian employee asks his employer if he may work with things that do not offend his Christian conscience, in this case with other crops that may be grown (grain, fruits and vegetables). On farms there may be livestock to handle or work in taking care of buildings not used for tobacco products. A Christian’s conscience and understanding of Bible principles will cause him to avoid sharing in tobacco production. For some hired farm workers it may mean seeking employment elsewhere, just as some have done who did not want to become involved with gambling, producing Christmas products, working for and being paid by Babylon the Great, etc., and be subject to removal from the congregation. A Christian woman married to a worldly man who farms tobacco can take care of housekeeping and cooking and other domestic duties and share in farm activities not directly involved with tobacco growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As is true in the case of tobacco users, if there is a grower or seller of tobacco who was once a baptized member of the congregation but who left the organization </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a long time ago</span><span class="font0"> and does not now claim to be and does not have local recognition as being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and his activity causes no community reproach or disturbance in the congregation, it would not be necessary for the elders to search him out and inquire whether he is working with tobacco, and neither is it necessary that they take action against such a worker who no longer associates with the organization. But if public reproach is caused by one who occasionally associates with the congregation or is identified as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the elders do have responsibility to maintain the congregation’s name for cleanness and to safeguard its right standing with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All Christians recognize that the light of truth is shining brighter, and as the years have passed many things have become clearer to us. (Prov. 4:18) True, years ago some may not have understood the import of scriptures such as John 17:16, Isaiah 2:2-4, Isaiah 65:11, Acts 15:29, Revelation 18:4 and others, and had employment that those scriptures show to be wrong. Yet, as the understanding has become clear and the light brighter, dedicated Christians have always been ready to come in line with the Scriptures and divest themselves of any business or employment found to be out of harmony with Scriptural instructions, even though it may have meant some personal financial loss. (You may have observed how some brothers have lost their employment because of insisting on taking time to attend a convention against the employers’ wishes. Some overseers have lost their employment because of going to the Kingdom Ministry School where they could equip themselves to serve the brothers better in their congregation. However, we have always seen that, by putting faith in Jehovah and trusting in him, they have been able to work out their problems, secure other work and continue to provide the necessities of life for their families, just as Hebrews 13:5 points out.) More recently we have come to see the issue clearly with regard to use and handling of tobacco and tobacco products, coca leaves, betel nut and other such harmfully addictive drugs. With full faith in Jehovah God, who is the great Provider of all good things, we are confident that Jehovah will take care of the necessities of his servants who in good conscience keep serving him faithfully. Those who put the Kingdom interests first and keep seeking the Kingdom will not be destitute of the material necessities.—Matt. 6:33; see also Philippians 3:7-9; 4:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some have inquired if the principle involved at Deuteronomy 14:21 would apply with respect to selling cigarettes or tobacco products to people of the world. In that law God acknowledged that unbled animals sold to the foreigners would be used by them for food. There is no known physical harm that would necessarily result therefrom, and such foreigners were already spiritually unclean before Jehovah. The eating of such meat did not change matters for them physically or spiritually. On the other hand, as regards tobacco products, we know that these are not a food, are in no way beneficial to one’s body, but are definitely harmful. How, then, can we appeal to the consciences of others if we ignore this and allow personal gain to outweigh love for neighbor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With full confidence in Jehovah God each one should seek to do the will of Jehovah and gain His favor. Jehovah will not abandon his faithful ones. It is sincerely hoped that all those who are involved with tobacco or similar products will have good success in working out matters so as to have a good conscience before Jehovah God and, as a result, continue to have a happy share in spreading the good news.—Ps. 37:25-29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s servants in this time of the end are prophetically described as demonstrating a spirit of willingness. (Ps. 110:3) We know that Jehovah has always been pleased with willing, whole-souled service.—2 Cor. 9: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But it can be asked: “How could Paul say, ‘Woe is me if I did not declare the good news,’ and at the same time perform his service willingly?” (1 Cor. 9:16) Paul knew what is stated at Ezekiel 3:18 about the serious responsibility to give warning to the wicked. He knew that Jehovah, out of his love for people, wanted them to be warned. Paul certainly had a love for people, too, did he not? And he willingly accepted Jehovah’s viewpoint with regard to preaching the good news to the world of sinful mankind. Furthermore, as shown at 1 Corinthians 9:17, he “willingly” carried out this ministry at his own expense.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is encouraging to know that so many of our brothers have willingly arranged their affairs to serve as temporary and regular pioneers. For the first month of the service year, 17,010 were able to serve as regular pioneers; for October, 17,-824; and for November, 18,687. Commendably over 30,000 served as temporary pioneers in September. Are these figures mentioned to make you feel under “compulsion” in some way to serve as a pioneer even if your circumstances do not permit you to do so? No, but, rather, as an encouragement, to show what others have been able to do to enlarge their contribution in the work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making.

(Gal. 6:4; 1 Tim. 5:8) Isn’t it encouraging, though, to know that so many of our brothers have been able to enlarge their privileges of service? Can you?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Our being motivated by the same “word of God” causes us to think of ways that we can enlarge our field service privileges. (Heb. 4:12) Younger ones may be able to serve as temporary pioneers during vacation periods from school. Family heads may be able to get time off from work or use evenings and weekends to serve as temporary pioneers. Such would require adjustments in their normal schedule, as can be appreciated. In some families it may be possible to help other family members to serve as temporary pioneers during the month of April. When elders and ministerial servants are able to take the lead in temporary or regular pioneer service, the entire congregation is benefited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Some have been able to use temporary pioneer service as a stepping-stone to regular pioneer service. If you will be serving as a temporary pioneer for consecutive months, endeavor to put in 100 hours each month. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Organization </span><span class="font11">book, p. 141) This will be helpful in determining if you are able to reach the hour requirement set for regular pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> During April many who are studying will have progressed to the point that they can be invited to share in the field ministry for the first time. Possibly you will be asked by the elders lovingly to assist such new ones. Where it will be advantageous, the elders can arrange for meetings for field service throughout each week in April to help all in the congregation to have a full share in the field ministry. Arrangements can also be made for experienced publishers to work along with others to give encouragement, having in mind the principle set out at Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As we continue ‘receiving’ in such a large way from the abundance of spiritual food provided through Jehovah’s organization, we feel moved to share such good things with others, don’t we? (2 Pet. 1:8) From our own personal experience we have found that giving willingly brings us great joy, just as Jesus said would be the case. —Acts 20:35.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word exerts tremendous power upon its hearers. Look what it has done for us. What it says is more powerful than anything that men can devise or speak. Using the Bible in our field ministry will work wonderfully to draw right-hearted ones to God, resulting in salvation to those disposed to obey Jehovah’s voice. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Are we using the Bible in our witness work as we go from house to house with the monthly offer and when we make return visits? Why the question? Reports from many parts of the country indicate that some publishers are not using the Bible as much as they were in the past.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To use the Bible in giving a presentation does require preparation on our part. Are we taking time to prepare our presentation so we can effectively use the Word of God in the field ministry?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When we call, how do householders view us?

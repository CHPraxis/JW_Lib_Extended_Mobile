<p><span class="font6">kingdom ^Pubfelie/iS:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reports coming in here each month from the more than 6,000 congregations in the United States are most encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In March there was a new peak of 20,104 regular pioneers. The report of 507,681 publishers represents a 15.5-percent increase over last year’s average. Comparisons of this March report with that of a year ago reveal that the number of return visits increased over 12 percent and home Bible studies were up nearly 11 percent. And this in spite of widespread sickness in many parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And do you know that every month during this service year has seen a phenomenal increase in the number of those baptized? Why, so far in the first seven months there has been a total of 39,118 baptized, compared to 25,469 in the same period last year. That represents a 53.5-percent increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is only to be expected that with all this stepped-up activity, this year’s Memorial attendance would make a big jump over last year’s. It is too early for the worldwide figure on this, but here in the continental United States there were over 130,000 more present than a year ago—more than a 12-percent jump!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The busy month of March ended with the special talk and,, was quickly followed by the even busier month of April, with the Memorial and with special issues of the magazines to distribute. There is no indication of letup in May either, with the distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Netos</span><span class="font2"> No. 18. And now after such a busy spring we are looking forward to a very busy summer with the series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies beginning this month of June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a happy sight to see so many new ones also standing steadfast and looking intently at the promised inheritance—perfect life under government by God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brothers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;"><img src="km_E_197406_files/km_E_197406-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:447pt;height:6pt;">
<p><span class="font7"># &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadfast While Looking at the Inheritance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Steadfast in Faithfail Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> We have good reason to be steadfast in our service to God and Christ. That service has brought us refreshment. (Matt. 11:28-30) No longer are we laboring under burdensome religious traditions. We have learned how to spend our time, abilities and assets purposefully, to the praise and honor of our Creator. We find pleasure in associating with loving brothers and sisters.\ We enjoy peace of mind and heart because of having a clean conscience before God and men. And before us there is the glorious prospect of life in God’s new order —life free from sickness, old age and death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Many honest-hearted people very much desire what we are enjoying. Are you eager to help them? During the month of June we will be offering the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Neto World Translation</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font2"> book on a contribution of $1.25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> True, many people have a Bible. But few read it. One reason for this is that the archaic language of a number of popular translations has discouraged them. Undoubtedly they will find reading the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Neto World Translation</span><span class="font2"> a refreshing change. Others do not even have a copy of the complete Bible in their home. Do they not need the “word of life”? At times older ones remark that they have difficulty in reading the small print in their Bible. You may want to show them your personal large-print Neta </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation</span><span class="font2"> when you return, or show the print size from the folder that you carry with you describing Bibles and Bible study aids.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Then, too, some people are interested in the Bible from a student’s or scholar’s standpoint. If informed about what is available, they may want to get the translation by Byington, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comprehensive Concordance</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding.</span><span class="font2"> It may be that these publications will aid such ones to come to know Jehovah. Also offer them to those with whom you conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> It is good to keep in mind our main objective for being steadfast in faithful service—to glorify our heavenly Father. Even if our territory is covered often, our work is not done. Jehovah God wants humans to have ample opportunity to repent. It is his will, therefore, that we speak to our fellowman again and again.—2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> We do not know just how many people will change their attitude and be among the “great crowd” that will survive the approaching “great tribulation.” (Rev. 7:9, 14) But as things worsen in this old system, more persons are having their eyes opened. Never have we had such increases as in recent months. Also, our repeated calls cause people to take notice, particularly when they see that we speak with conviction about our God-given hope. Truly, now is no time to slow down and to devote less time to the field service. Rather, it is a time for zealous activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Whether you have been sharing the “good news” with others for many years or just a few months, continue steadfast. Many persons are listening appreciatively to the good news. Do not become discouraged when others do not listen with appreciation. Few responded to Jesus Christ, but he continued steadfast. Even if you are able to say just a few words, you are still bearing fruitage, for your appreciative heart is motivating you to bear witness. (Matt. 13:23; Luke 6:45) You are showing love for Jehovah and deep concern for fellow humans. So continue to rely on Jehovah and the help of his spirit to strengthen and sustain you in faithful service. Remember, “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.”—Heb. 6:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JUNE 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 </span><span class="font11">min: Song 33. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Accounts report; include comments on the article entitled “Kingdom Halls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 </span><span class="font11">min: Discourse, along with some audience participation, on the article “Steadfast in Faithful Service.” Include comments on weekend arrangements for field service and encouragement to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Appreciation of Jehovah’s Provision for His Servants to Assemble Together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Divine Purpose” District Assemblies are soon to begin. Assemblies are important in the lives of Jehovah’s servants. (Invite the audience to comment on the following points, using material from the Bible, “The Watchtower,” “Awake!” and “1974 Yearbook.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(1) How does the Bible show that large assemblies have long been a feature of true worship? (Neh. 8:1-3, 7, 8; Lev. chapter 23) The experiences of our brothers in Germany and elsewhere. can help us to appreciate this provision. (2) Although some had very little materially, w<sup>r</sup>hat did they do about attending assemblies? (“yb,” p. 99, par. 2; p. 219, par. 1) (3) What type of sleeping accommodations did they gladly accept? Why? How can we benefit from their example? (“yb,” p. 249, par. 1) (4) When they encountered opposition, how did the outcome give evidence of Jehovah’s blessing? (“yb,” p. 215, par. 5, through p. 216, par. 2; p. 224, pars. 1, 2) (5) How have large assemblies resulted in a grand public witness, to which all those in attendance contributed by their presence? (“yb,” p. 219, par. 4; p. 238, par. 4; p. 239, par. 4) (6) How has the conduct of our brothers and sisters attending assemblies resulted in a good witness? What responsibility should we feel in this regard? (w73 8/15 p. 486; w74 3/1 p. 149; g72 10/22 p. 19; km 5/73 pp. 7, 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The. facts make it evident that Jehovah’s blessing is on these assemblies of His people; by our attendance we share in that blessing. Encourage all to attend one of the assemblies this summer. Discuss any local arrangements to aid all in the congregation to get to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. As time allows, include recent items of special interest from “Insight on the News” or “Watching the World.” Encourage all to read, before next week, the; March 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You.” Song 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JUNE 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 31. Introduction, text and comments. Discuss highlights of Branch Letter and items of interest from Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: “Regular Coverage of Territory.” Discuss article, using audience participation. Include comments on field service arrangements for the days ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Joy in Finding Answers. Discourse and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In daily life and field service, questions arise. What answer is in the Bible and publications of “faithful and discreet slave”? Rather than just ask someone, use “Watch Tower Publications Index” to find the answer. Doing your own research with “Index” is both quick and satisfying. It will bring you joy.—Prov. 2:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Display indexes. (1930-1960; 1961-1965; 1966-1970; 1971; 1972; 1973) Publications are indexed by year. The “Aid” book is covered by 1966-1970 “Index,” so that “Index” is of particular value. Abbreviations of publications are explained in front of each and on left-hand pages. Each “Index” has Scripture portion and subject portion. Available in Kingdom Hall library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With indexes and some publications on platform, show how to use. Note: State answers in one or two sentences. Do NOT spend time giving detailed answers; show HOW TO FIND answers. (1) Is it wrong to have a pet sterilized? (Check subject portion in 1973 “Index” under “Animals” and subheading “sterilization.”) (2) Does Matthew 27:52 mean that at Jesus’ death some persons were resurrected? (Check Scripture portion of 1973 “Index,” then 1972, 1971, and finally 1966-1970; brief answer at “ad,” p. 478; p. 1004 deals with another aspect; p. 1134 gives extensive discussion.) (3) What material can I use to help someone who is depressed? (Check subject portion under “Depression”; 1973 “Index” lists g73 10/8 12, but it is not right aspect; 1972 “Index” leads to w72 521, 522, good, but is there more?; 1971 “Index” refers to W’hole article, w71 261-264.) (4) Why is Gehenna called “second death” if some persons going to it never died before? (1973 “Index” under “Second Death” refers to “ka,” pp. 157, 158.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you do not have a certain publication referred to, likely another brother does, or it may be in the library at Kingdom Hall. Increase your joy and blessings by using “Index” often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Discuss with audience material from the March 15, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Consider What Jehovah Has Done for You.” Include material from the article itself, but encourage audience to comment from their own hearts too. Song 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JUNE 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Song 27. Introduction and family discussion of text. Family also to discuss helpful thoughts on how to offer the current magazines; discuss and emphasize details in article “Showing Consideration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: What We Are Doing in the Field Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman briefly comments on what congregation has done in recent months as to hours, placements, return visits, conducting home Bible studies, etc. Comment on local trend in meeting attendance, also any increase in number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discussion among a number of zealous publishers who are regular in field service on weekdays; some may have regular meetings for service, and others may simply arrange among themselves to go out at set times. Encourage them to tell what they do and to share experiences giving evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Several brothers discuss arrangements for evening field service and on the weekends. Outline local arrangements for witnessing on July 4. Encourage enthusiastic participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Invite publishers who have new ones they would like to take out in service to speak to the elders about the needed qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman interviews some w<sup>T</sup>ho are regular pioneers or those who often temporary pioneer as to why they do it, also how they arrange their affairs to manage it. Encourage others to include temporary pioneering in their plans for the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on April 15, 1974,-“Watchtower” article on the subject “Why Be Honest?” Include some audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Discuss Question Box material and include appropriate items from Announcements as time permits. Song 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JUNE 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Song 42. Introduction; family discussion of text. Family also discusses April 1, 1974, “Watchtower” article “Do You Practice ‘Finders Keepers’?” 15 min: “Presenting the Good News —Where There Ip No Ready Response.” Discuss article and demonstrate points that will be helpful locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: &quot;What Are You Doing Now to Prepare?” Talk based on article in April 15, 1974, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Encourage good use of opportunities for field service over the weekend. Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JULY 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Song 40. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Making Application in Our Field Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Several publishers discuss what can be done to make practical application in local field service of the counsel received at the district assembly in the program part entitled, “Preach, Saying, ‘The Kingdom of the Heavens Has Drawn Near.’ ” Emphasize thoroughness in our field service, also importance of making disciples and how to start home Bible studies. 25 min: Review of District Assembly Program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Invite comments on the following points: (1) New things learned; these may be new to the individual publisher, not necessarily all of them new to the organization. (2) Helpful counsel regarding elders, their qualifications and responsibilities. (3) Suggestions that were offered to assist new ones to make progress spiritually. (4) What young ones among Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in service to God. (5) Qualities or attitudes that we should cultivate; how and why to do so. (6) Lessons learned from the Bible dramas. (7) Experiences, whether related on the program or enjoyed personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It would be beneficial to make arrangements before the assembly for various ones to make notes on the points suggested above as a basis for review of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(If you have not had your district assembly by early July, you can have another program on this week and then arrange to have this assembly review after your district assembly.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular Coverage of Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Because we are sincerely interested in helping all persons living in the congregation’s territory to hear and respond to the Kingdom message, we call on them repeatedly. Various literature offers and a variety of approaches are used in an endeavor to stimulate their interest in God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> We try not to neglect any in our territory. With that in view, many field overseers find it helpful periodically to review the territory record form (S-13), making a notation of territories that have not been worked for the longest period of time. Then, when you request territory they can readily let you know which territories are most in need of coverage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> It is reported that, in some places, prior to the circuit overseer’s visit a request is made that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> territories be turned in even if they are not completely worked. Is that really necessary? It would mean that none of the publishers would have territory in which to work. However, every time you cover a territory, it would be appreciated if you would notify the brother who cares for the territory records so that these will be up-to-date and will provide a meaningful record of the work that is being done and that needs to be done in the congregation’s territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Have you had a territory out for more than four months and not been able to complete it? Then why not ask the book study conductor to arrange for some publishers to help you to complete the territory? Thus the people living there will not be deprived of the opportunity to hear the good news regularly.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">• Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are you an elder or a ministerial servant? During this service year, have you taken time to read the entire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book to refresh your mind on the many details that it contains? We encourage you to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">-^►Literature Offer for June: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font11"> with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font11"> book, for $1.25.

For August: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book, or other pocket-sized publication, for 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O Congregation accounts should be audited during June; the presiding overseer should make arrangements for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O Many inquiries have been received regarding special pioneer service. Generally speaking, the opportunities for enrollment as a special pioneer are few. However, there may be a need for some replacements from time to time. There are still many places, however, where regular pioneer help is much needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O New Publications Available:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Thorough territory coverage is important, as you know. Therefore, before turning a territory back in, it is beneficial to make an effort to contact all who were not at home. If your congregation is covering its territory every month or so, then give particular attention to trying to contact persons who were not at home on the initial call, making repeated efforts on various days. One sister makes a note of the name and address where older magazines are left at not-at-home calls and then when she gets home that same day she calls the person on the telephone. Possibly you, too, would get good results by doing things in this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Have you held the same territory for quite some time? There is benefit in having the same person work a territory a number of times. But it is also true that one publisher may succeed in presenting the good news to a person who was not willing to listen to others. Realizing that, after you have worked it once, or possibly several times, you may want to let other publishers have that territory so that the persons who live there will benefit from their different approaches and presentations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Our interest is certainly not merely in seeing how often we can cover the territory. Lives are involved. And as people hear and embrace the truth, there is increased praise to Jehovah. So, work closely together to care well for the part of the field that has been entrusted to the care of your congregation.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Showing Consideration</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Would you want someone to leave a visible sign that you are not at home in these days when burglars are watching for opportunities to ransack homes? We are sure you would not. So it is well, as we participate in the field service and leave handbills or older magazines at doors when people are not at home, to be sure that they are completely out of the view of passersby, if at all possible. If the handbill or magazine is slipped inside a screen or storm door, then, of course, you will want to be sure that the door is properly closed when you leave. If it is not possible to leave a magazine out of sight, then you may deem it best simply to leave a handbill in some unobtrusive spot, if possible slipping it under the door.—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> It should be borne in mind, too, that any article that is placed in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">receptacle</span><span class="font2"> that is identified as being for “U.S. Mail” should have postage on it. So do not use mailboxes in this way. However, if there is a slot in the door through which an article can be pushed (but behind which there is no receptacle), there is no objection to leaving a tract or a handbill or a sample magazine in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> If you decide to send literature through the mail to someone who has shown interest or to a householder whom you are having difficulty in finding at home, please be certain that you have enough postage on it and show your own name and address as the sender. Do </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font2">show the Society’s return address for items that you mail personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Considerately handling matters in these ways will leave a more favorable impression with those upon whom we call.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Many congregations are enjoying the pleasure of being in new Kingdom Halls or in enlarged or improved facilities. In the past 38 months in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii), 839 congregations have either constructed new Kingdom Halls or purchased and remodeled existing buildings. Another 1,139 congregations have engaged in remodeling projects, enlarging or improving existing Kingdom Halls. Some have increased the seating areas, some have added rooms for additional Theocratic Ministry School classes, some have increased parking facilities, and so forth, in an effort to accommodate the increased numbers attending meetings. This is fine and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where There Is No Ready Response</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> What can be done to terminate a call tastefully when you discern that the householder definitely is not interested? (Prov. 15:23; 25:11) Should continued efforts be put forth to stimulate interest or to place literature until the door is forcibly closed, or would it be better for you to terminate the call, respecting the householder’s wishes at the time?—Eccl. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Discerning publishers know there is a difference between offering the Kingdom message in a clear and understandable way, letting the householder then decide what his response will be, and trying to force the message on someone, using pressure methods such as worldly salesmen employ. Jehovah does not force anyone to worship him but rather lets each one choose whom he will serve. (Josh. 24:15) If we have clearly presented matters so the householder knows what is being offered to him and he then indicates he is not interested, there is satisfaction in knowing we have done our best to give a clear and understandable presentation, isn’t there?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> When a person declines the literature offered or a home Bible study, there is no need now to view him as an “enemy.” People can change, as we know. We can still be friendly, possibly saying: “I’m glad we could talk for a few minutes. Maybe we can visit again for a few minutes the next time I call.” </span><span class="font1">Kingdom Halls &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">it is good to see them expanding now. There may be even more congregations that have done something along this line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a joy to see the increase that Jehovah is giving, and it is a pleasure to observe that the congregations are taking appropriate steps to accommodate the increase. What a congregation does in this regard is, of course, for the congregation to determine. If a congregation finds it necessary to go outside the congregation to finance such a project, the Society will be glad to entertain such inquiries and provide any information it can that may be helpful.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What is accomplished by doing things in this way? The householder, for one thing, should be impressed with the fact that you have considered his viewpoint, respected his right to decide personally in such important matters. Possibly by the reasonableness shown in your yielding instead of pushing matters to the point where he gets irritated and feels the need forcibly to terminate the call, he will be more inclined to listen on subsequent calls made in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Where it is not possible even to get a brief discussion started because the householder says he is busy vze could kindly acknowledge his objection, possibly commenting, “Getting enough time to care for all the many things we want to do is an increasing problem, isn’t it?” and offer a handbill, suggesting, “When you have a few minutes you may want to consider the thought on the back of this handbill (mention whatever it is briefly) and maybe we can talk about it the next time I call.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> It could be that the person was really busy, but in many cases people say this so as not to get involved in a lengthy discussion, which may have happened previously when a Witness or a worldly salesman called. Or he may feel that his best defense is not even to let you get started. As a result of your understanding response and consideration he may even indicate a willingness to continue the discussion right then. If so, use discernment in determining when to terminate the call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Our following such suggestions does not mean that no effort is put forth to handle objections or that we are going to give up easily in our efforts to persuade individuals to accept the Kingdom message. (2 Cor. 5:20) Time and circumstances may determine a person’s interest or response, so we are careful not to judge persons on the basis of their response to our presentation on a single call. But when we discern that a person’s mind is closed we know there is no need to keep talking until the door is closed if this can be avoided. Rather, we can accomplish much good by using discernment in how we terminate calls where there is no real interest manifested.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question ($ox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">® What can be done when a householder verbally requests that no one call at his home, or there is a sign on the door saying that no salesmen or religious groups should call?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When we meet persons who are very much opposed and who request that we not call at their home again, we will respect their wishes in the matter. A dated note may be put in the territory envelope so no one will call in the future as long as the householder remains there. Of course, people do move, and at times some have a change of heart. If one is not certain about the householder’s still living there, in time a tactful inquiry can be made. Decide locally what would be best in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where there are signs saying “No Peddlers or Solicitors,” and so forth, it may be best to identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, taking the viewpoint that such signs do not apply to our work. Where signs specifically state that no religious calls be made or that Jehovah’s witnesses not call, it. may be 'well to talk personally to the householder, since the previous occupant may have put up the sign, or the householder may have had a change of heart. If the householder then verbally requests that we not call, matters may be handled as outlined above.</span></p>

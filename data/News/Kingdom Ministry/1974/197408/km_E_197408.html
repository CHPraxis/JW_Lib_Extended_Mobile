<p><span class="font12">For many months we all looked forward to this year’s series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies and the privilege of attending one of them. Now, as this letter goes to press, the majority of us are looking back on this thrilling experience, calling to mind the many blessings we there received. If you have not yet attended, we earnestly urge you to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Early reports show that, at the first 25 assemblies held in 17 states from coast to coast, there was a peak attendance of 325,542 with 8,468 being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Among the many interesting reports brought back from these assemblies was the news item that Brother Knorr related during his closing comments at Jacksonville, Florida. He told how the Society had just arranged to purchase a new Wood-Hoe rotary printing press, to be delivered next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This press, much bigger than any we have now, is 61 feet long and weighs about 42 tons. It is unique in that it has three large printing cylinders, each 70 inches wide and over 4 feet in diameter. The 70-inch-wide web of paper travels through the press at 1,000 feet a minute—over 11 miles of paper an hour! At this speed the cylinders make 75 revolutions per minute, and with each revolution they print 768 pages, the equivalent of FOUR 192-page books per revolution. That is 18,000 complete pocket-size books an hour—150,000 books during each day’s regtdar shift! As they come off the press the pages are all collated and ready for sewing and binding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You can just imagine how long and loud the Bethel family applauded at hearing this good news. We are sure you are just as eager as we are to see it in operation —a press capable of printing more than 40,000,000 books a year without overtime!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Seek peace and pursue it.” (1 Pet. 3:11) The need to act on this inspired admonition takes on ever-increasing urgency in this concluding period of the “last days.” Only those who are at peace with Jehovah, conducting themselves in harmony with his commands, can hope to survive the fastapproaching “great tribulation.” —2 Thess. 1:6-9; 2 Pet. 3:10-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Appreciating this, we rejoice in seeing thousands upon thousands responding to the “good news of peace” and taking steps to gain an approved standing before Jehovah God. (Acts 10:36) Many of these have progressed to the point of themselves sharing the “good news of peace” with others. Here, in the United States, during the month of May, 92,532 more persons participated in this vital work than did last May. That is marvelous indeed when we consider the changes many of them had to make in their way of life in order to represent Jehovah, the God of peace. A tremendous witness was given, over 40 million copies of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 18 being distributed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The thrilling increases in the ranks of Kingdom proclaimers are an indication that many more sincere people are yet to be found. And it is heartwarming to observe that Jehovah’s people as a body are responding wholeheartedly to the need of such persons to become reconciled to God. Just think of it,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The inserts are separate from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry’s.</span><span class="font12"> These inserts are to be held by the overseer and not to be distributed until the special service meetings early in September. of the 539,262 proclaimers of the “good news of peace,” 20,745 were regular pioneers. This was the largest number of regular pioneers to date. Might you be able to arrange your circumstances to join these pioneers?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> During the month of August we will again have fine opportunities to aid others to seek peace. We can do so by distributing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, a publication that has certainly aided thousands to seek peace with Jehovah and, in fact, to continue pursuing it as his dedicated servants. Over 74 million copies of this publication have now been printed in 91 languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Even if you just recently started to proclaim the “good news of peace,” perhaps sharing in distributing the tracts, you will find it a pleasure to use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book to aid others. This is a publication that you have studied. You know what it contains and what things particularly impressed you. Your sincere, enthusiastic expression about what you learned may be just what is needed to reach the hearts of truth seekers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> Of course, if people are really going to be helped to become pursuers of peace, they need to be instructed in God’s ways. It is encouraging, therefore, that now 37,000 more studies are being conducted on the average than last year. We surely want to be alert to every opportunity to start additional Bible studies. Some on whom you will be calling during the month of August may already have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. Why not help them to appreciate how beneficial it would be for them to have a Bible study in their home? Perhaps you could invite them to get their copy of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book and then demonstrate the study method, using one or two paragraphs, if </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>To All Dedicated Servants of </span><span class="font19">Jehovah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">September 8, 1974</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Dear Brothers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Last week we had a thought-provoking special meeting with newly associated ones, did we not? Those who have shown interest in Jehovah and his grand purposes certainly were encouraged to think seriously and prayerfully about their standing with the Creator. Impressed upon them were the urgency of the times and the importance of their letting love for Jehovah move them to identify themselves on his side before the “great tribulation” strikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In view of the time, we, too, need to think seriously and prayerfully about our relationship with Jehovah God. It is not just a matter of looking forward with eager anticipation to the “great tribulation” and life in God’s new order. Continued effort is required in proving ourselves to be Jehovah’s devoted servants. The apostle Peter admonished: “Since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.” —2 Pet. 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a people,</span><span class="font13"> we are heeding the apostle’s inspired counsel and are also aware of the need to continue making advancement in Christian living. But that is not necessarily the case with each individual professing to be a baptized disciple of Jesus Christ. So it is good for all of us, individually, to think seriously and prayerfully about what we are doing with our life in the concluding portion of the “last days.” Were the “great tribulation” to begin tomorrow, what would our standing before Jehovah be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Discharging Our Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Toward the World of Mankind</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Consider what you are doing in discharging your responsibility toward those who still are not approved servants of Jehovah. Their lives are in grave danger at the fast-approaching “great tribulation.” Are you responding to their urgent need for help? Are your circumstances such that you could make adjustments in your routine of life to enable you to share to a greater extent in the vital warning and rescue work that will be ending soon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This does not mean that you should be pushing yourself to the very limit, spending absolutely no time for relaxation. Even Jesus Christ saw to it that his disciples got needed rest and refreshment. (Mark 6:31, 32) But the way you spend your time should reveal that the dominant desire of your heart is to prove yourself to be a loyal “fellow worker’ of Jehovah God, that you are putting yourself in a position to be used to the full by him in opening the hearts of your fellowmen to accept the truth.—1 Cor. 3:9; Acts 16:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In some cases, might discussions within the family circle lead to some family member’s having a fuller share in this final part of the preaching work? Perhaps by a pooling of resources and effort by family members, one of their number could serve as a regular pioneer or a temporary pioneer. Even if that were not possible because of family responsibilities, could such a combining of effort result in increased preaching and teaching as a family? Would this concluding period of the “last days” not be an appropriate time for intensified activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We do not want to have a charge of bloodguilt leveled against us because of having been indifferent to the critical situation of people in our territory. (Compare Ezekiel 3:17-19.) And this is not going to be the case with us </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">as a body. </span><span class="font13">Genuine love and concern for fellow humans will not allow us to render mere token service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This is certainly no time to be distracted by a desire to get comfortably situated in the world or bv undue anxiety over making a living. (Matt. 13:22; Luke 21:34, 35; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10; 1 John 2:15-17) Because of having been commissioned to preach and to make disciples, true Christians have always had to put secular pursuits in a secondary place, devoting to preaching and teaching the time and effort that could otherwise rightly have been used to further material interests. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Should this not, then, be particularly the case in this concluding portion of the “time of the end”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Our keeping secular work in its place, as a means to sustain ourselves in God’s service and to aid others in obtaining physical necessities, will protect us in the troublesome times that we will doubtless face in the near future. (Eph. 4: 28; 1 Tim. 6:6-8, 17-19) We may be called upon to share what little we have with brothers who may be in even great er need. Will we be eager and willing to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then, too, we have no assurance that any of our material possessions will survive the &quot;great tribulation.” Remember Lot. He lost his house and other material possessions and thereafter had to put up with the discomfort of living in a cave with his two daughters. (Gen. 19:2, 16, 24, 25, 30) We also may find things very uncomfortable for some time during and after the destruction of this ungodly system. Might our attaching undue importance to material things now cause us to complain then and contribute toward making things more unpleasant for us and others? (Compare Numbers 11:4-6, 10; 20: 3-5.) An even greater tragedy would be having heart appreciation for our relationship to Jehovah snuffed out by our being overly concerned about material possessions now and losing out on life, as did Lot’s wife.—Gen. 19:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preserving Fine Conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Remaining spotless and unblemished is not limited to our making wise use of time and assets in discharging our responsibility to preach. (Acts 20:26, 27) Our personal conduct is also involved. (Matt. 5:14-16) Are we striving, as the apostle Paul did, to keep sinful inclinations in eheck? (1 Cor. 9:27) Are we making progress in cultivating the fruitage of God's spirit? (Gal. 5:16-18, 22-24) Do we appreciate that enmity, contention, division and envy are just as bad in Jehovah’s eyes as fornication, drunkenness and idolatry?—Gal. 5:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By far the majority of those dedicated to Jehovah God are preserving fine Christian conduct in a world that is rapidly becoming more degraded. We are also very much aware of our weaknesses, daily appealing to Jehovah for forgiveness of sin and striving hard to make improvement.—1 John 1:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But a few have allowed hatred to build up in their heart. They may refuse to speak to certain brothers and sisters, harboring grudges over minor offenses, real or imagined. They may ascribe bad motives to fellow<sup>7</sup> believers, wrongly judging and condemning them. They may even carry on slanderous talk.—Gal. 5:13-15, 25, 26; Jas. 3:5-16; 4:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Still others may try to get as close to the world’s ways as possible. They w’ant to show worldlings that we, too, can have &quot;fun.” Such action may reveal itself in immodest dancing, heavy drinking and the like.—1 Pet. 4:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What does examination of your conduct indicate? If you see areas wherein you could make improvement and you really want to do so, you have reason to be happy. Why? Because it show’s that your heart is responding properly, motivating you in the right direction. On the other hand, you may recognize that your heart has set its affections on things other than spiritual interests. Or, you may have difficulty in getting along peacefully with others. In that ease, you w<sup>r</sup>ill want to work hard to adjust your thinking so that your situation does not wmrsen and the &quot;great tribulation” find you spotted, blemished and at disunity with Jehovah God and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What we have as Jehovah’s servants is something too precious to sacrifice now w’hen we are so close to the realization of our hope—life in God’s righteous new order. Would it not be foolish to allow ourselves to yield to temptation and to become practicers of sin? Would it not be tragic to lose out on life due to the pursuit of temporary material riches, compromise under pressure from the world, or developing an indifferent attitude toward the lifesaving preaching and disciple-making work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even now w<sup>T</sup>e enjoy rich rewards from serving Jehovah. We have true friends who really care about us. While we still have problems, our situation is far better than it w<sup>r</sup>as before w<sup>r</sup>e kneiv the truth. The wisdom contained in the Bible has enabled us to cope much better with the problems of life. Obedience to God’s Word has enabled us to get along better within the family and in our daily contacts with others. Has this not made life more pleasant for us? Really, what better w<sup>T</sup>ay is there to live than as a devoted servant of Jehovah God? This in itself is something to guard jealously, along with the prospect of an eternitv of life in the fast-approaching New Order.—Mark 10:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Make it your solemn determination to do your utmost to be found by Jehovah God &quot;spotless and unblemished and in peace.” Exert yourself in helping others to gain salvation while there is yet time. Let your whole course of life testify to the fact that you are convinced that your relationship to Jehovah is the most important thing in your life. Live each day as if it wore your last. If you do this, you can rest assured that no matter wdien the &quot;great tribulation” strikes, you w’ill not be caught unprepared and fall but will continue standing as an approved servant of Jehovah.—Rev. 7:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your fellow<sup>7</sup> servants,</span></p><img src="km_E_197408_files/km_E_197408-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:39pt;">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Conscious of It?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Of what? Of the importance of being on time in all your activities! Are you at the Kingdom Hall before the meetings start? Are you early enough at meetings to greet other brothers and interested persons warmly when they come, and to care for other responsibilities? Do you punctually keep your appointments? If you do, then you are a punctual person. Punctuality is a mark of loving consideration and thoughtfulness. It is an evidence of order in your life and is deeply appreciated by those with whom you associate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> One way that a Christian can show his thoughtfulness is by being punctual for spiritual meals with the congregation. This shows respect for our Host, Jehovah God, and for his arrangements. What happens when we are even a few minutes late? Premeeting fellowship is missed. Also, we miss the opportunity to unite with our brothers in joyful singing that extols Jehovah’s name, tells of his wonderful works and encourages to faithfulness. We miss the grand and uplifting privilege of approaching Jehovah in prayer as a congregation of his people. Missing the first few minutes of a meeting is like picking up an article to read and starting with the fourth paragraph—we miss the setting, the introduction, and so our overall understanding and enjoyment of it are lessened. And if we are late in arriving at a meeting, not only do we miss vital information, we also distract our brothers who are on time, so they do not receive the full benefit of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> It is true that there may be times when, despite our care, we are late in arriving at a meeting. Public transportation may be delayed, or one’s own car may break down. A person who comes from a religiously divided household, or a mother who has small children to bring with her, may encounter unanticipated problems just when it is time to leave the house. If possible, rather than missing the whole meeting, it would be better to persevere and get to the hall to benefit from as much of the meeting as possible. Others in the congregation will understand; they too have unexpected problems in their lives. But in those cases where the circumstances are ones that we can control, let’s be sure that lack of good planning or indifference does not cause us to be persons who are frequent latecomers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What an encouraging thing it is to the brothers to come to the meeting and find the elders and ministerial servants there ahead of time, waiting to greet them warmly and to welcome them! It fills us with a warm feeling for our brothers and deep appreciation for the theocratic family of which we are a part. So if you are an elder or a ministerial servant, keep in mind the wholesome example you can be by arriving early for the meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Punctuality is also important when meeting for field service! If just six minutes are lost by ten publishers gathered for field service, in waiting for a tardy brother, it means one hour of field service lost that day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Our work of making disciples requires punctuality on our part. When we are punctual, this instills confidence on the part of newly interested ones in the organization we represent. By being on time we demonstrate that we are persons of our word, letting our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Yes” </span><span class="font12">mean “Yes,” and our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“No”</span><span class="font12"> mean “No.”—Matt. 5:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Yes, it is wholesome to be conscious of the value of punctuality— how it affects us, what it says about our attitude toward others. What we do influences the lives of other people.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Elders’ Meeting During Circuit Overseer’s Visit</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Some questions have arisen as to the circuit overseer’s role in connection with the elders’ meeting. This meeting should be just as carefully and thoughtfully planned by the presiding overseer, who acts as chairman of such meeting, as the regular elders’ meetings held quarterly. If the visit coincides with the time for one of the quarterly meetings, or is near that time, the presiding overseer may deem it appropriate to combine these into one meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book, pages 82 to 86, deals with the circuit overseer’s visit with the congregation, including this special meeting. On pages 64 to 67, it also shows the need to prepare properly for these important meetings. The book mentions a number of matters that beneficially could be considered, but there are undoubtedly other matters that the local body of elders realize need attention, and each elder should let the chairman know, orally or in writing, well in advance of the meeting, if possible, what items he believes deserve discussion. Based thereon, the chairman should prepare a schedule, allowing time for each subject, and planning for a meeting that will not be unduly long.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The circuit overseer, based on his review of the condition .of the congregation with the presiding overseer on his arrival, may also suggest questions for discussion at the meeting. Also, if the meeting is near the close of his visit, since he will have had opportunity to observe the condition of the congregation and may have some additional valuable suggestions to make, the chairman can ask him to mention these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Generally the circuit overseer has many years of experience in Jehovah’s organization. And since he, as a specially appointed traveling elder, spends much time in such meetings in different congregations, he is in position to pass on to the elders helpful examples and things learned. So the elders should avail themselves of his experience.—Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Through Christian Conduct and Dress</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As representatives of Jehovah, his Christian witnesses are often in the public view. We are a people very closely observed by the world in general, and most persons in the world readily recognize that Jehovah’s witnesses are different. But what makes us different?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We are different because we have separated ourselves from the world. We no longer indulge in its “works of the flesh.” (Gal. 5:19-21) We do not share the materialistic ambitions and unchristian jesting so popular with this old system. Rather, our outlook is spiritual— at least it should be. And as spiritual men and women we should seek never to be identified with the old world in any way—whether by appearance, dress, speech or conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In all these things we should always reflect Christian modesty and separateness from the old system. Most brothers and sisters therefore consider very carefully what clothing they will wear when going into the field service, making sure that it is well arranged, modest according to Bible standards, and not ignoring what is viewed as appropriate according to local custom. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10; 1 Cor. 2: 12) Also they are careful to see that what they wear is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">clean</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">neat</span><span class="font12"> and that their book bags are in good condition. In this way their appearance will not detract from the message they bear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Our conduct is very important, too. Of course, there is a time and place for recreation and other things besides field service, but when engaging in the field service our conduct should be exemplary. The preaching of the good news is serious work. We reflect joy in our work, but if we were joking and making a lot of unnecessary noise when going from house to house, people might not take seriously what we say; at least they would feel we certainly were not serious about our work as Christians.</span></p>

At the same time may we continue to pursue peace ourselves, demonstrating in our attitude, words and actions that we are fully devoted to Jehovah and his righteous ways.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Oftentimes, we have opportunities to do informal witnessing. But have you ever found that you held back from giving a helpful witness to someone, perhaps because you felt that your conduct and appearance at the time did not recommend you as one of Jehovah’s witnesses? This is something to consider, isn’t it? We are servants of Jehovah </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all the time, </span><span class="font12">not just a few hours each month. And people observe what we do </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all the time,</span><span class="font12"> not just when we are in the field service. Whether shopping, going to and from work, attending a wedding or a reception, going to school or in other daily activities, we are observed. Yes, people have their eyes on Jehovah’s servants. If our dress at times when we are not in the field service were immodest or in imitation of some worldly fad, do you think that people who observe us would be inclined to accept us as genuine Christians when we called on them to discuss the Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Therefore it is good to remember at all times who we are—Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. Let us help people to realize that we are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font12"> Christians, separated from this old system, not only by what we preach but also by good appearance and fine conduct at all times. —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">• AVhat factors determine when congregation meetings will be held?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While there is no set pattern of meeting times to be adhered to, why we have our meetings at a certain time is in some respects more important than when they are held. Some questions for the congregation to consider in regard to meeting times are: How many other congregations must use the same Kingdom Hall, so, what choice of times is available? At what times will new ones most likely attend? What are the work and school schedules locally? What is our motive in wanting meetings at a certain time? Are we willing to put some personal preference aside so as to benefit the congregation as a whole?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider what the apostle Paul said: “All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful; but not all things build up. Bet each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.” (1 Cor. 10:23, 24) In harmony with this principle, the elders, when considering possible meeting times to recommend to the congregation, might ask themselves: Will such an arrangement prove advantageous spiritually to the congregation and to new ones, aiding them to be present for the meetings? W<sup>r</sup>ill such a schedule really aid us to put Kingdom interests first, or, rather, will Kingdom interests be neglected?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After considering the factors involved and the recommendations of the elders, it is up to each congregation to decide their meeting times locally. As outlined in the “Organization” book, page 103, par. 3, the congregation would “choose times that are convenient for the majority of the members of the congregation.” Those whose schedules conflict with meeting times are pleased to make adjustments so as not to neglect their spiritual interests. If several congregations meet in the same Kingdom Hall, then meeting times ■will have to be worked out between them in a loving, Christian way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The time for congregation book studies within a congregation may vary according to the circumstances of those who make up a book study group.</span></p>

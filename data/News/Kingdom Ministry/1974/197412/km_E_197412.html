<p><span class="font10">When the Bethel family heard Brother Knorr’s report at the breakfast table on what had been accomplished world wide this past service year, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font10"> one of us was overjoyed. Magazines printed: over 471,000,000, up more than 70,000,000 over the previous year. Bound books printed: 51,000,000, up more than 171/4 million. The peak of publishers reached 2,021,432, with more than double that number, 4,550,457, attending the Memorial. That is over 550,000 more than attended the Memorial the year before! But the real thrill came when we heard that 297,872 had been baptized! Here certainly is evidence of an ingathering of the “great crowd” seen by the apostle John as survivors of the coming “great tribulation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Details of this report as well as an account of the modern-day history of Jehovah's witnesses for the past hundred years are found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1975 Yearbook.</span><span class="font10"> Don’t fail to get your copy. We feel sure that you will want extra copies for relatives and neighbors too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bethel family also heard a report from Brother F. W. Franz about his recent visit to certain countries to the south. After attending the Trinidad district assembly he spoke at special meetings in Sao Paulo and Iguazu Falls, Brazil, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in Asuncion, Paraguay, and in La Paz, Bolivia. All together, the attendance at these gatherings was upward of 25,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brother Leo Greenlees, also of the governing body, told the Bethel family about his recent visit to the Middle East. In one of the countries where the work is banned, after he overcame difficulties in contacting the brothers, a meeting was quickly arranged. Though it got under way after midnight, they were glad to attend. This was a very special treat for the 50 present, most of whom had never met someone from the Brooklyn Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new arrangement for the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Daily Exulting in Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Doesn’t it warm your heart when you think of the marvelous year of blessings we have experienced as Jehovah's dedicated Christian witnesses? Our heavenly Father has been good to us in so many ways and, as our 1974 yeartext has pointed out, we have been able to exult in Jehovah despite earthly hardships.—Hab. 3:17, 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Reflecting on what has happened during the calendar year, we realize that there have been many hardships world wide, and our brothers, too, have been affected by them, including such things as food shortages, economic instability, runaway inflation and disasters from storms and earthquakes. Nonetheless, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we as a people have been extremely joyful. Indeed, our faith has been sustained day by day by remaining close to Jehovah through a study of his Word, meditating on it, sharing it with others and persisting in prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Appropriate to the fact that we exult in Jehovah is our literature offer for December. We will be featuring the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> and the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is? </span><span class="font10">Kingdom Ministry School is working well. There are eleven of these “traveling schools,” compared with the former five permanently located ones in the United States. Besides being a much more convenient arrangement for the brothers attending, it allows some to attend who formerly could not do so. About 600 are benefiting from this course each month instead of the 250 under the old arrangement, which means that within two years all the present elders could attend. The forward movement of the organization is a pleasure to behold, giving all of us added reason to keep on exulting in Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Keep in mind, too, that, for persons who may want them, you can obtain the large-print edition of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible in Living English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also, during December, we will be having four public talks on the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?,</span><span class="font10"> and in the first two service meetings outlined in this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> many of its excellent field points will be featured. Be sure to bring your copy of the book to these two service meetings. Surely this will prepare us to present this book and the Bible to the people. What benefits they will receive as they read the Scriptures and rejoice in what Jehovah’s Word has for all of us in these critical and yet thrilling times!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Using the Bible and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">This Life</span><span class="font10"> book in combination, you may want to turn to the illustration on page 24, and, after showing the householder this illustration and explaining it briefly, you can read Psalm 90:10. Thereafter, you may want to say: “As you can see, the Bible recognizes the way things are relative to our life-span today. But is this the way it will always be? Please note what is said in this regard at John 17:3, pointing to the hope of everlasting life in a righteous new order.” Then read John 17:3. As a suggestion, why not use a new copy of the regular edition of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font10"> and, after doing what is suggested above, hand them to the householder, saying that these copies can be his for just $1.25. If the householder wants only the new book, then, of course, we will accommodate him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>n</sup> As we approach the new year full of anticipation, we will continue to exert ourselves and exult in Jehovah day by day, realizing that he is directing all things to his glory.—Ps. 145:2.</span></p>

(May express such thoughts as. 'We would run out of things to do,' or, 'Without sickness and death or some problems we would lose appreciation for the good things In life. ) Publisher can reply: 'Do we really need sickness so as not to become bored with good health? People do not lose joy In living because they feel well, do they?’ Also, can point out that likely there are many things we would like to do In our lives, such as developing some talent In music, painting, sculpture, or learning something about woodwork, mechanics, designing or architecture.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Building Meeting Attendance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How important are meetings to Jehovah’s servants? So important that in some lands our brothers have risked their very lives or freedom to attend regularly. Such ones have recognized that, just as failure regularly to eat wholesome food may eventually produce sickness and even death, so persistent nonattendance at meetings can result in serious spiritual illness. At meetings we receive encouragement to persevere in serving Jehovah despite the many pressures, physical and mental, coming upon us in this dying system of things. Realizing the importance of meeting attendance, what can we do to encourage any of our brothers and sisters who may be ‘getting tired and giving out in their souls’ to assemble with us and be revitalized in faith and fine works?—Heb. 12: 1, 3; 10:23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Primarily the elders in each congregation have the responsibility to “shepherd the flock of God . . . becoming examples to the flock.” (1 Pet. 5:2, 3) Since elders also have a large part in teaching the congregation, they can do much to build appreciation for meetings by making them as interesting and instructive as possible through their own good preparation. How much the entire congregation appreciates and benefits from every well-prepared meeting! Too, as elders aid their own families to participate in meetings, this will set a fine example for other family heads.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When visiting the homes of brothers, elders may find it beneficial to show a family group, not only how to hold a good family study, but also how to prepare specifically for meetings, how to find and underline answers to questions in the publications, how each family member can be given something to do when getting ready to leave for the meetings, so all will have the necessary supplies. He can encourage individuals and family groups to review the Theocratic Ministry School schedule and the program for the service meeting in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> each week to see what publications will be needed. These schedules are like a menu outlining the spiritual food that will be enjoyed that evening. They whet our appetites for the meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■' Those having parts on the program should apply the information to local circumstances. When, on certain occasions, an entire portion of a service meeting program does not apply to the congregation (such as an article dealing with isolated territory, in a city congregation where there is no such territory nearby), the elders may choose to substitute a part dealing with some local matter, the consideration of which will be of benefit to the congregation. Everyone having any part on a service meeting can ascertain what, if any, adjustments may be needed to make that part as practical and upbuilding to the congregation as possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> A congregation book study conductor has a fine opportunity to be a blessing to his brothers through his own good preparation. Before coming to meetings, he should have clearly in mind what he wants to teach and how he is going to do this. Obviously, it is necessary to know in advance how much material will be covered. He should be able to recite to himself the main points he wants to teach and it will be helpful if he has review questions prepared. During his concluding comments at the book study, he may, from time to time, whet the appetite of the brothers for the remaining meetings that week by asking two or three questions on high points that will be considered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> As elders share in the shepherding work, they can visit those missing meetings and encourage them to attend. In some cases the elders may be able to arrange for them to have transportation, wherever this would encourage more regular attendance. When an emergency occurs that prevents the one being assisted from attending a meeting, however, it would be a kindness to telephone the brother providing transportation so time and money are not wasted. Elders can also help more to participate in meetings by reviewing with them during their visits the suggestions in Studies 7 and 18 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook.</span><span class="font10"> Surely this will prove to be an occasion for a real interchange of encouragement and will be most faith strengthening.—Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ We will help ourselves to get more benefit from the meetings by preparing for them individually or with our families. If we cannot prepare thoroughly for all the meetings, probably we can consider at least some of the material before attending the meetings. If the entire lesson cannot be studied in preparation for the book study, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Fine Program of Spiritual Instruction </span><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>The Theocratic Ministry School program that has been arranged for the 1975 calendar year will furnish us with an abundance of spiritual food. All of us will want to benefit from it fully.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The schedule has been so arranged that, for any given meeting, much of the material will be drawn from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font10"> and one pocket-size hook. You will doubtless want to bring these publications, along with your Bible, to the school, with the exception of written review nights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As you look at the schedule, you can see what a wealth of fine material we will cover in the months to come. Even though we have been using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font10"> book for four years, a vast storehouse of rich spiritual food still remains to be tapped in that publication. So we will continue to make good use of it. Toward the latter part of the year our Bible reading assignments will take us back into the Christian Greek Scriptures, to consider the faithful example of our Lord Jesus Christ! The talks based on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font10"> can aid us greatly in exposing religious error and in building up others’ faith in the dependability of God’s promise of everlasting life. Additionally, we will practice discussing God’s view on matters of current interest in the world, such as ESP, pornography and mercy killing. Faith strengthening will be the discussions based on experiences of Jehovah’s servants in this century who maintained integrity and were strengthened by his spirit to endure under very trying circumstances. Our reviewing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book in the school will do much to enhance appreciation for the loving way in which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font10"> 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The new service year got oft to a splendid start with 522,055 proclalmers ot the good news in the field. This Is nearly 10,000 more publishers than for the previous September. Also, 298,740 home Bible studies were conducted. It makes us rejoice to see the fine efforts being put forth to help honest-hearted ones, and what a privilege personally to have a share:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Just ahead of us is the thirtyseventh annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">campaign. Jehovah’s servants everywhere greatly appreciate the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> magazine with its timely counsel, its explanation of “the deep things of God.” (1 Cor. 2:10) Whether we are newly associated or have been serving Jehovah for many years, it is not difficult to recall many new and good things we have learned from its pages. Truly it is one of the foremost instruments that Jehovah is using today in progressively revealing the marvelous truths in His Word.—Prov. 4:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Appreciating the spiritual blessings we have received from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> ourselves, we want to see that it regularly reaches as many households as possible. To do this effectively will require good organization and preparation, both individually and congregationally. This year the Society is assisting all of us to use a fresh, attentiongetting Scriptural presentation with each issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">during the campaign. Yes, we can take the title of the first </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article and the scripture featured in bold type with the opening article of each issue during the campaign and use these as the basis for a brief presentation. Thus we can have a presentation tailor-made to the magazine we are offering, showing the householder the spiritual benefits of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Building Meeting Attendance (Conf’d) </span><span class="font10">the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study or the Theocratic Ministry School, then why not prepare to answer at least a few questions or even one. Of course, the greater the advance preparation the more we will gain from a study. Participation in the study should be our goal. (Gal. 6:7) Since regular meeting attendance and commenting play an important part in our spiritual growth and fortify us for future tests of our integrity, let’s make it our determination to be at all the meetings and encourage others to be present with us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For example, the January 1, 1975, issue on page 3 has the article “Why Is It So Hard to Make a Living?” We could begin our presentation by asking the householder that very question. Let him comment. Then turn to page 4 and, pointing to the scripture that is made prominent there, say that things have gotten so bad in some places in the world that they are fulfilling what the Bible, in Revelation, foretold, namely, “A whole day’s wage for a loaf of bread.” (Rev. 6:6, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font10"> Use such appropriate boldface headings as “What Is Behind It?” and “What Can You Do About It?” to show what the article discusses. Also, direct attention to the last page of the article, with the subheading “What the Future Holds,” showing what is ahead as outlined in the Bible. Briefly comment, not only on the impending “great tribulation,” but also on the grand prospects of God’s new order.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Conclude by showing the need to learn the permanent solution, since these very conditions show that this system is soon to end, and the importance of being on God’s side. Knowledge is necessary, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is the foremost magazine presenting good news of God’s established kingdom. Its refreshing and encouraging message can come twice monthly for a year at a cost of only $1.50.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> You may find when reading the article that there are other points that you would like to use. Fine. Use what works for you. Read from the Bible where you can, but in many cases you may prefer to read scriptures right from the article. This same method can be used with the issues to follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> At the meetings for field service during the campaign a brief review of the opening articles in the current </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will prove most stimulating to all. Also you will find it beneficial to practice presentations at home. Then we will be able to enjoy one of the finest campaigns yet. Think, too, of the excellent spiritual blessings that will flow to those who are enabled to receive the faith-building information in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> to their benefit and to Jehovah’s glory.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font8">• In a case In which a person, because of genuine repentance. Is not dlsfellow-shiped. is It nonetheless proper to restrict him from the preaching work under certain circumstances?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">When one is privately or publicly reproved, the Information on page 168 of the Organisation book applies, while It Is true that certain restrictions may be placed on such Individuals, it Is good to note what Is said on page 168 regarding the preaching work, namely: &quot;The person would be free to engage fully in the preaching work and to report such . . Likely In the case of a notorious situation where one is publicly reproved, it would be the course of wisdom for that one to engage in the preaching work in a section of the territory where the problem Is not widely known, at least for a while. It Is good to keep In mind that the preaching work is a basic part of our service to God, and all who serve Jehovah should be sharing in It.—Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What about a person who has been reinstated following disfellowshiping ? Should he be allowed to engage In the field service Immediately? Yes, in harmony with the above thoughts he should be allowed to engage In the field service following reinstatement. As to other privileges in this regard, we can be guided by what is stated In the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font8"> book, page 177.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah is dealing with his servants today. And the material from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font10"> book can equip us to reach people who doubt the authenticity of the Bible. All of that is included in our school program for 1975!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When you are scheduled to give talks, you may not be able to use all the material. But be sure to develop the main points. To this end, read the material carefully and then determine what the main points are. A good selection of main points (perhaps three or four) and choice supporting arguments from the material will result in talks that are the most beneficial for everyone present.</span></p>

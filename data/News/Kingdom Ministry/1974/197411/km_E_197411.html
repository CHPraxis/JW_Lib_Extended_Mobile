<p><span class="font1">NOVEMBER 1974 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Although the flg tree itself may not blossom, ... I will exult in Jehovah himself.”—Hab. 3:17, IS. </span><span class="font1">VOL. XVII NO. 11</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Dea/t ^Kingdom ^puMtelie/iS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The figures are now in, and indeed this past service year has had Jehovah’s blessing. The number of publishers in the United States increased 15 percent; that means, on an average, 66,878 more praisers of Jehovah. This, in turn, made necessary 483 additional congregations, for a total of 6,542 just in this country. The tremendous increase is also reflected in the number baptized. There was an ail-time record of 81,588 persons immersed this past year! Just think—that is more than the annual figure for the whole world just seven years ago. It certainly makes us rejoice to see so many persons get started on the way that leads to real life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These newer ones, along with the rest of us, will find the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1975 Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> fascinating. Many who have joined us in Jehovah’s service in recent years, while deeply appreciating the truth, have not read much about the actual development of the modern-day organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. But the details are in the new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font2"> It focuses on the development of the work here in the United States and is the most complete and comprehensive account yet written on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in modern times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We suggest that you order extra copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1975 Yearbook.</span><span class="font2"> Providing copies of it for your relatives, neighbors and acquaintance^ may prove to be a good way to help them to learn the facts about Jehovah’s witnesses. Even though they might not read other publications about our beliefs, they might be very interested in this. It is an official account of the organization, its development and growth for the past one hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ever since the hurricane that slammed into the Central American country of Honduras in midSeptember, leaving between 7,500 and 8,000 persons dead according to newspaper reports, we have had</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Others Heed What We Have</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> There are many honest-hearted persons who do not yet know the truth about God and his purpose. They are distressed at what they see taking place in the world, but do not know which way to turn. They, too, need the truth that comes from God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The hour is very late for this dying system of things. Appreciating the urgency of the times, we arrange our affairs to make time to reach others with the truth. And we rejoice to see so many responding favorably. As one publisher wrote, “Isn’t the fine increase wonderful? It certainly bears out the fact that not all of the ‘sheep’ have been gathered yet, and it makes us want to go ‘hunting’ all the more.” Nothing we could be doing at this time could be more rewarding. Why so? Because, as we share in it, we are actually ‘fellow workers with God,’ and the many inquiries about the welfare of our brothers there. A few days after the storm we here at Bethel got the news that, although hundreds of our brothers lost their possessions, not one of them had lost his life. In short order brothers in nearby Nicaragua and Belize, as well as here in New York and in New Orleans, had relief supplies on their way to the brothers in Honduras. All together, within a very short time some 56,700 pounds of relief supplies were sent, in addition to thousands of dollars for the purchase of supplies locally. Isn’t it a blessing to be part of an organization in which there is real love for one another?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Soon all who live will be people of that sort. As we confidently await the coming divine victory, let’s keep busy aiding all who have a love for righteousness to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. We send you our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brothers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font2">results of our work will endure. —1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The first ten days of November are being spent distributing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 19. Undoubtedly, thousands who read it will be moved by the information, as were thousands through previous issues of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font2"> One couple who were moving into an empty apartment found a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 18 in a drawer, the only thing left in the whole apartment. After reading it, they called the phone number given, a study was started, and not only are they attending all meetings regularly, but they have also expressed a desire to be baptized. Another man called the same congregation and wanted to know what he could do to help in the distribution. A study was started, and he too is attending Sunday meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Interestingly, every month to date during which we have distributed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font2"> a new peak of publishers has been reached: 512,738 shared in field service in September 1973; 525,007 published in December of that year; and our present peak of 539,262 was reached last May. Likely, many more contacted in our witnessing activities will be sharing with us this month in field service. Wouldn’t it be grand to see another peak of publishers for November!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> It is suggested that, after we distribute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 19, we work the same territory again as soon as possible with the offer of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font2"> book on a contribution of 25c.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>G</sup> In addition to placing literature as we work territories covered with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font2"> we should have in mind starting Bible studies wherever possible. How encouraging it is to note the fine increase in Bible study activity!

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> None of us should be wasteful. Jesus classified as “unrighteous” a steward who handled his master’s goods wastefully. (Luke 16:1, 2, 8) In contrast, Jesus Christ, after distributing divinely provided loaves and fishes, told his disciples: “Gather together the fragments that remain over, so that nothing is wasted.” Do we personally show this same attitude toward provisions that Jehovah makes for us today?—John 6:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah does not “miraculously” multiply the publications used by his servants today, but provides such through the vigorous efforts of brothers working in the Society’s branches and the contributions of brothers all over the earth. And even though the Brooklyn and Watchtower Farms plants produced 45,718,920 books, 13,874,957 booklets and 268,509,382 magazines during the past service year, it has been necessary to enlarge the night shift and purchase additional machinery to keep pace with the constantly increasing demand for Bibles and literature. We are glad to do it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> But various reports state that many of the publications are, in a sense, not being used wisely. Oftentimes Bibles, books, songbooks and magazines are left unclaimed at Kingdom Halls and assembly sites or are discarded, though in good condition. Too, it is reported that many magazines are being ordered only to be discarded sometime after the issue date has passed. What can be done to ensure that these provisions from our heavenly Master are used wisely?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> During the period of Bible writing, the Scriptures were hand copied on scrolls and were considered very valuable. Paul instructed Timothy: “When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.” (2 Tim. 4:13) Just as Paul valued his clothing, having left his cloak with a trusted brother, so he valued those scrolls, entrusting their safe delivery to the care of Timothy. Having a similar appreciation for the Word of God today, parents will not allow their children to scribble in or otherwise damage Christian publications any more than they would be allowed to damage expensive clothing. The low price of the publications should not cause us to underestimate their value. Also we should have in mind that the cost of paper continues to increase and various types of paper are scarce on the market. Proper</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> From earliest times the elderly among Jehovah’s people have been held in high esteem. They were respected for the experience and knowledge that age brings and for the wisdom and sound judgment it may produce. Elihu showed this respect when he addressed Job’s three companions. (Job 32:6, 7; 12:12) Jehovah, who refers to himself as “the Ancient of Days,” commanded: “Before gray hair you should rise up, and you must show consideration for the person of an old man.”—Lev. 19:32; Dan. 7:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Respect for age is also evident in the Christian congregation. The wisdom that comes with accumulated years of faithful service can make a substantial and beneficial contribution to the entire association of the brothers. Unaffected by the attitude of this passing old system, we are grateful for the blessings of having the elderly among us. The question is, Do we always show it? Or may we, perhaps unwittingly sometimes, neglect older ones, thus missing a great blessing ourselves?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Are the older ones made to feel welcome at the meetings and encouraged to participate freely? Are arrangements made to assist them in getting to meetings and into field service, even if some of them are not able to stay out as long as others in the group? Are they included when personal social arrangements are made, perhaps to share a meal or to enjoy pleasurable association?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What of those confined for health reasons to home, bed or institutions? Are regular visits made by elders and others, keeping such ones supplied with current spiritual food? Can younger ones be encouraged to assist such infirm ones with shopping, housework, care of our Bibles, books, songbooks and magazines will extend their useful life and present a more respectable appearance in the field service and at congregation meetings. In this way, we not only imitate Jesus in not being wasteful, but additionally we glorify Jehovah by an attitude of appreciation. —Ps. 50:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Elders in a congregation may note that far more magazines are being ordered each month than are being placed by the congregation. If we notice that older magazines are accumulating in our home, why not make a special effort to distribute these to nursing homes and hospitals, or place them through informal witnessing or at errands, etc.? Would you be willing to read aloud from the Bible or one of the Society’s publications to an older person no longer enjoying good eyesight? Elderly ones may hold back from requesting assistance in various circumstances, but without doubt they will be deeply appreciative if it is offered.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> It has happened that unbelieving relatives have assumed responsibility for disabled elderly brothers, placing them in homes or institutions far away without the congregation’s knowledge. This can result in bleak and lonely isolation, unless the congregation exerts every effort to ascertain the whereabouts of such ones and thereafter inform the congregation nearest to them of their need for Christian association. In the meantime, the original congregation ought to keep in touch as much as possible by telephone, letter writing or visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Growing old sometimes brings disorders affecting behavior, which can become matters of concern in the congregation. Elders should approach these problems with great love, compassion and understanding, not dealing harshly or unkindly. (1 Tim. 5:1) In times of serious illness or need our elderly brothers need to know that the ’congregation is aware of their situation, ready to render assistance and indeed appreciative of this opportunity to express love to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah’s elderly servants should always be made to feel the love, appreciation and respect of the congregation. Rather than neglecting them, as the world often does, let us assign them dignity and honor and thus reflect the loving viewpoint of our ageless heavenly Father.—Prov. 16:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">not-at-homes? If we have more than we can use in this way, even though the magazines may be months old, why not ask the elders if others in the congregation can make use of them? If we find that our personal magazine order is regularly more than we are able to .place, then it would be better to order fewer magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>G</sup> Each one of us, whether young or old, can show appreciation for the provisions made through Jehovah’s organization. How? By using our Bibles and study aids wisely, seeing that they are not carelessly wasted, but are used for the purpose intended—to further the interests of pure worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">With Illustrations</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations.” (Matt. 13:34) Jesus appreciated their value. Illustrations can arrest a hearer’s attention and arouse his thinking faculties. And what is equally important to us in presenting the good news, they can stir the emotions and aid in reaching the heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Some illustrations are verbal; others are actual pictures. Did you know that you have a ready-made source of useful illustrations for your field service? Where? In the Society’s publications. For example, the picture found on the cover of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 19 can be used effectively in our follow-through work with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose” </span><span class="font2">book. How? By taking along our personal copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">and pointing out the illustration to those with whom we speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> After a friendly greeting, we might say: ‘Recently we left at your home a copy of this thoughtprovoking item, “Is This All There Is to Life?” Undoubtedly you noted here on the cover a cycle we are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Others Need What We Have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font2">316,112, an average increase of 34,775 over the 1973 monthly average. Yes, many people are realizing they, too, need the truth and are responding to our invitation to have a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Letters continue to be received stating that evening witnessing is an excellent time to find householders at home and in a relaxed, receptive mood. Some congregations have made arrangements for evening service, starting around 5:00 p.m., and are receiving fine support from the publishers. Often where no one was at home on weekends or during the day because both husband and wife work, contact was made through evening witnessing. Could you make use of this proven means of locating those who might otherwise be overlooked in daytime field service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Just as we need the truth and appreciate what having it means to us, all others need what we have if they desire to ‘do the will of God’ and ‘remain forever’ on earth, enjoying the blessings of God’s eternal purpose.—1 John 2:17. all too well familiar with: A baby grows into childhood, adulthood, middle age, old age, and then . . . Haven’t we all wondered at one time or another, Was it really God’s purpose that man should live on the earth a few years, grow old and then die, leaving only a memory in the hearts of those who loved him? [Allow for householder’s reply.] If you are familiar with the Bible account, you probably remember the Bible’s explanation of how sin and death entered human experience through the disobedience of Adam and Eve. [Allow for any response the householder here wishes to make. If no comment offered, briefly explain how Adam disregarded God’s warning and ate of the forbidden fruit, which brought upon him old age and eventual death.] Notice what is stated in this Bible commentary . . . [Turn to page 55 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font2"> book and read first three sentences. Then continue . . . ] Since death was not the purpose of God for mankind, what was? And will that purpose ever be realized? This publication follows the development of God’s purpose from its inception right on through to the promise of its realization in our day, as outlined in the Bible. You may have this copy for 25 cents.’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Illustrations can likewise be effectively used when placing magazines and obtaining subscriptions. One traveling overseer presented a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font2"> subscription to a woman only to have her state she was not interested. The brother, prepared for such a response, drew attention to an illustration in the magazine, taking time to explain its meaning as the householder mused over it. She subscribed. Why? The initial conversation had failed to capture her attention in a favorable way, but the use of an illustration reached her heart and she “saw” the value of what was discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Effectively using the illustrations provided in the Society’s publications can result in honest-hearted ones today ‘getting the sense’ of the Bible’s message, even as did honest-hearted ones in Jesus’ day.—Matt. 13:51-53.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font11">• In view of our understanding of 2 John 9-11 as discussed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of August 1, 1974, would there ever be circumstances that would allow for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> disfellowshiped person to attend a meeting held in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> private home?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Generally speaking, disfellowshiped persons are not invited to meetings held in private homes. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book (page 174) said: “A disfellowshiped person is not prohibited from attending meetings in the Kingdom Hall open to the general public as long as ne conducts himself prop-<sup>x</sup>erly. None will greet him, of course, and he may not attend any meetings held in private homes.” This is true concerning those who are ‘pushing ahead’ and do not ‘‘remain in the teaching of the Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, if </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> disfellowshiped person is trying to make a comeback, showing repentance, and if he is not in violation of what is stated at 2 John 9-11 by continuing to practice or to advocate what is contrary to “the teaching of the Christ,” it may be he would be allowed to attend meetings in a home if there is no Kingdom Hall in the town and where brothers open up their homes for public meetings, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> studies and service meetings so that the home serves in the place of a Kingdom Hall. In such cases the home would be viewed as similar to a Kingdom Hall during the hours when those meetings are held. The meetings are under the control of the body of elders. They will know the facts concerning the disfellowshiped person and can consider whether his attending a meeting in a home would bring reproach upon the congregation. They may discuss the question among themselves and with the householder. If there is no objection on the part of the householder to the disfellowshiped person’s attending, then the elders may so inform the disfellowshiped one, and he would be allowed to enter that home during the hours when the home is used as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> Kingdom Hall. At all times when he is there, the disfellowshiped person must conduct himself properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where the only meeting held in a private home is the book study, a disfellowshiped person would not be invited to attend, but he may attend meetings held at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As pointed out in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">of August 1, 1974, page 465, a Christian may greet a disfellowshiped person who is not like those described at 2 John 9-11, but he would certainly not go beyond a word of “hello” or greeting. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> August 1, 1974, page 472, suggested that, where fleshly relationships are not involved, it would be well to leave to the elders further conversation or exhortation.</span></p>

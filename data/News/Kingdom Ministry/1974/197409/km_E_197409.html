<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>kingdom ^PuMiske/ts:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">With the end of August conies the end of another service year, and what a wonderful year it has been! A year with the greatest Memorial attendance ever; a year when the greatest number were baptized. Think of it, more were baptized in the United States in 1974 than in all the world a mere seven years ago!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Capping off the year and making it complete was the delightful series of “Divine Purpose” District Assemblies. They will long be remembered for the two new releases, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Have you finished reading these exciting new publications? If not, we urge you to do so without delay. Don’t put this off until the material is covered in the series of public talks that are to be given. The information these books contain you need to know now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And don’t wait either until the special campaigns later this year before letting your friends, neighbors and relatives get copies of these new books. Why not carry a copy or two of each wherever you go—to work, out shopping, when visiting friends? And you children, in starting back to school, why not take copies to your teachers? This way it will be easy to explain where you went this summer and why you enjoyed the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now we are starting a new service year, and one that holds promise of being an exciting one. Before we' get around to distributing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 19 we will have a big magazine month, October. The special October 8 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> deals with the question “Does God Care?” In these troubled times this is an issue you will certainly enjoy distributing. Tell the brother handling the magazines in your congregation now how many extra copies you want. You’ll be sorry if you run out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Fine Opportunities Ahead for the 1975 Service Year</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As we enter the new service year, we have a feeling of keen anticipation. We are well aware that we are now nearly sixty years into the “conclusion of the system of things,” and that the time remaining is short. None of us know exactly when the “great tribulation” will strike, but we have full confidence that it will come at precisely the time fixed in advance by Jehovah.—Hab. 2:3; Matt. 24:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> But before that time arrives, we have work to do—lots of it! This is evident from the numbers of interested persons that show up at our Kingdom Halls. It is shown in reports that during the past year, in one country after another, record numbers of persons presented themselves for baptism as dedicated servants of Jehovah. It is also evident from the number of persons who accept our literature when we call at their homes, and from the worldwide increase in the number of home Bible studies. There is every indication that many more persons will yet come out of darkness into God’s wonderful light.—Isa. 60:11, 12, 22; compare 1 Peter 2.'9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How can we help them? Regularity in the field service will aid us to keep in constant touch with those who are willing to open their hearts to the good news. And when we locate persons who give evidence of sincere longing for the truth, let’s keep in close touch with them, answering their questions and aiding them to see the grand purpose that Jehovah has for mankind. Right from the start, urge them to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall. There is no time to lose.—Compare Genesis 19:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> No doubt many who attend the special service meeting during the first week of September will also be grateful for your further assistance. Some may need a personal Bible study. Others may be ready for aid in learning how to share in the field service. Certain ones who have known the truth for many years may have problems in their lives that are holding them back from dedication and baptism. Perhaps the elders can help them. Whatever the need, these persons have some interest in the truth. This interest, in some cases only a spark of it, may be fanned into a flame by a personal visit and by the sincere interest we display. Our own depth of love for Jehovah, and the sense of urgency that we feel, may help to infuse in them a desire to move ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> While we are busy aiding newly interested ones, we need to be careful not to overlook the needs of those who are already our brothers and sisters. (Gal. 6:10) Among them are tens of thousands who, during the past year, have been baptized. There are still many matters in which they would no doubt be grateful for assistance. It would be beneficial for the elders to visit them as they are able to do so. Other publishers, too, can be of help by sharing interesting points that they learn, also by inviting newer publishers to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">go </span><span class="font10">with them in the field service and by personally helping them to learn how to enjoy activities in which they may not yet be sharing. Aid them to grow in appreciation of the fact that everything that they do in life has a bearing on their relationship with Jehovah, and that the greatest joy comes from the doing of Jehovah’s will. —Compare Philippians 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> As you share zealously in the work of preaching and teaching in the days ahead, keep alert, too, to the importance of strong bonds </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 48. Introduction, text and comments. Family group discusses use of “Evolution” book during September. Consider how recent public statements on this subject make it timely to offer the book. Explain how placement of this book relates to building up faith in God and his purpose. Discuss where and how to offer the book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font8">Taking It to Heart. Last week we had a special service meeting for all dedicated, baptized publishers. What did we do with the letter after we got home? Have we read it? Did we look up the scriptures? Ask audience: What points in that letter and in our program last week, did you find to be specially significant? (Have some publishers ready to comment extemporaneously on this; invite others to comment too.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font8">“Fine Opportunities Ahead for the 1975 Service Year.” Question-and-answer discussion. Read scriptures as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. Include comments on Branch Letter. Encourage all elders to read the article “Recommendations to the Governing Body.” Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 46. Introduction, text and comments, and appropriate Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">“How Do You React to Apathy?” Talk using material from article in* July 15, 1974, “Watchtower.” Have audience share by looking up and commenting on some scriptures discussed in article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font8">&quot;Does God Care?” (Suggested sermon for October in presenting “Awake!” subscription offer.) After each point of sermon is discussed by chairman with audience, interrupt discussion to demonstrate how this point can be used in building coherent sermon. Sermon should not be involved but simple, meaningful and very brief —one that each publisher would feel qualified to use or adapt for his use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I’m calling briefly to discuss a question that seems to be on the minds of good people everywhere. They wonder, ‘Does God reallv care about man?’ Will God tolerate injustice and human suffering forever, or will he intervene sometime in the future and bring an end to war, corruption, suffering and other bad conditions? I’m sure you have thought about this, too, haven’t you? [Allow for comment.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In reading the Bible we see that God long ago promised better conditions for man, but several thousand years have gone by since some of these prophecies were written down. The question presents itself then, If God does care, why does he not bring an end to these bad conditions? Is there some reason why he has not done so before now? Yes, the Bible gives us the answer to these questions. For example, look here at 2 Peter 3:9, where the apostle tells us: [Read scripture.].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The next few verses show that ‘Jehovah’s day’ will come, at which time this old system of things with its oppressive rule and inadequacies will be destroyed as if by fire. This will prepare the way for God’s new system of things. Note his promise on this at verse 13: [Read scripture.].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yes, righteousness is to dwell in the earth when God’s heavenly government removes wicked conditions. But this subject raises other questions, too, doesn't it? When will this occur? And how can we share in the blessings personally? These and related questions are answered from the Bible in this special issue of ‘Awake!’ We are inviting everyone to subscribe. The cost for one year, with 24 copies coming to you, is 31.50. With the subscription I will be happy to leave this special issue of ‘Awake!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chairman can explain that publishers can further simplify the sermon if desired by using just one scripture text, either verse 9 or verse 13, and then lead into the “Awake!” subscription offer. When a subscription is not accepted, offer the special “Awake!” and “Watchtower” for 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even after the subscription campaign, you may on occasion want to use this sermon, and then you can offer one of the 25c publications such as the “Truth” book, the “Evolution” book or the “Peace and Security” book, all of which have chapters dealing with why God has allowed wickedness and how it will be eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. Include remarks showing how, like Christ, we can gain victory over the world. (John 16:33) Song 49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 58. Introduction, text and comments, and Theocratic News items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Discussion of that part of “Presenting the Good News” dealing with the special “Awake!” Discuss with audience choice points that might be used in presenting this special issue. Audience can make suggestions as to how points in articles can be adapted to local territory needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">“Living Amid Turmoil in Ireland.” Talk based on article in September 1, 1974, “Watchtower.” Ask audience how knowledge of faithful example of brothers in Ireland will help us when faced with community pressure to join violent groups. How can we carry on our preaching work in times of violence and distrust? How is a Christian’s being no part of the world a protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. Include appropriate points on need for all to have the evangelizing spirit and to grow in effectiveness in preaching the good news. (See w74 6/1 pp. 335-340.) Many new ones joined us in proclaiming good news during past several years. Commendable that they have shared in tract and magazine distribution. Many are also giving effective sermons. Some still need help. What can be done to help them take the next step in presenting the good news with et-. fectiveness? Perhaps they can now give a one-scripture sermon and present the “Awake!” subscription offer. (Demonstrate how to do this.) Some may wish help to make a return visit in an effort to start a Bible study. Experienced publishers, be sure to lend a helping hand. Song 57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 63. Introduction, text and comments, also Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font8">“Teaching at Congregation Book Studies.” Question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font8">Reaching Those to Whom Particular Articles Might Appeal. Chairman selects copies of magazines during past few months containing articles that might particularly appeal to groups or individuals in congregation’s territory. He will offer suggestions and get comments from audience on what they found effective. For example, the article on “women’s liberation” in the 7/1/74 “Watchtower” may have been of special interest to some they knew'. The increased interest in the occult and exorcism might have opened the w'ay for presenting the 6/1/74 issue dealing w’ith the occult, or the 7/15/74 issue, which discussed under “Questions from Readers” w’hether Christians have the pow’er today to exorcise demons. Often “Awake!” articles on world affairs, various trades and skills, features of a countrv, and so forth, will appeal to professional people and others in the territory. When articles are read, think of those among friends, w'orkmates and relatives who might enjoy and benefit from them. Ask for experiences in using the magazines in this way. Also comment on use of October 15, 1974, “Watchtower.” See “Presenting the Good News,” paragraphs 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">“True Christians Cannot Be Cowards.” Talk based on article in 9/1/74 issue of “The Watchtow'er. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">11 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. One or tw’o brief, encouraging experiences. (Select in advance.) Song 54.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font8">&lt;&gt; Congregation accounts should be audited soon after September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt;&gt; After the body of elders has determined who will be the new presiding overseer, field overseer, Bible study overseer, etc., with due regard for the rotation system, announcement should be made to the congregation. However, if the elders have in mind using a brother who is new’ly being recommended to the governing body for appointment as an elder, they will wait until he is appointed before giving him any definite assignment of oversight.

<p><span class="font8">&lt;&gt; New' presiding overseers should not request that congregation mail be sent to them, if mail is already going to a different permanent address.

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Benefits from Our &quot;Double&quot; Blessing of New Books</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">Regarding Job’s blessings following his difficult test. Job 42:10 says: “And Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Does not the expression “double amount” bring to mind great blessings for Job, even as the account goes on to describe? But think of the “double” blessing in the form of new pocket-size books that we received at the recent district assembly. We were delighted at the release of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is? (ts)</span><span class="font10"> and looked forward to reading it ourselves and using it in the field service. Yet then our joy at the assembly was more than “doubled” when we got </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s “Eternal Purpose” Now Triumphing for Man’s Good (po)</span><span class="font10"> and learned that we will be studying it in the congregation book studies starting in December. What blessings!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Special Talks</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">We also learned that during November and December we will have a series of special talks based on these new books. Many of us know from experience in past years how beneficial it is to cover new books quickly by means of such talks. It aids us rapidly to become familiar with their contents, or serves as a fine review if we have already read them. However, additional benefits will be ours in this case. We will be placing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose” </span><span class="font10">book in the field service in November, and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">This Life</span><span class="font10"> book along with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font10">during December. Hence, will not our covering the books in these talks stimulate our enthusiasm to share the publications with others? And will not this coverage also familiarize us with their contents so we can effectively present them to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">True, you may not be one of the speakers handling these talks. By all means, though, plan to read ahead of time the chapters to be covered. Make the talks a part of your conversation. Enthusiastically invite your relatives and interested persons. Make sure they have personal copies of the books so they can follow along during the talks, just as you will be doing. Thus all will benefit fully.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Scheduling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">As announced in the July </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> if possible, the talks should be arranged for the nine weekends of November and December. The first five talks will be based on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose” </span><span class="font10">book, followed by four from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font10"> If the circuit overseer’s visit or a circuit assembly comes during that period, the series of talks should be arranged around these events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In some cases the elders (and certain ministerial servants) of a congregation will be able to handle all of the talks. If that does not seem possible or advisable, two congregations can exchange speakers who are elders, dividing the talks between the two. When this is the arrangement, an elder will give his talk in both congregations. This may involve one congregation’s having each talk a week after the same talk was given in the other congregation. But in working out the schedule, the nine talks should come in their proper sequence. As soon as</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">KINGDOM MINISTRY, SEPTEMBER 1974 </span><span class="font10">details have been completed, handbills should be ordered. And the congregation should be informed exactly when they can expect the talks.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Speaker’s Preparation and Delivery</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">If you are to give one of the talks, thoroughly study the chapters assigned to you and the corresponding outline that follows. Note that you are not merely covering material—you are to give an informative talk on a specific theme. Instead of trying to present every detail of the chapters assigned to you, strive to convey the main ideas highlighted in the outline. Be conscious of your audience, working to involve them; reason with them and motivate them. You may want to refer the audience to key passages or illustrations in the book so they can actually follow along in the book, becoming more familiar with its contents. Thus you will be multiplying the benefits.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Coming to Know the God of Purpose (po chapters 1-4)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Happily persons of all sorts are coming to know God.</span><span class="font10"> (5 min.) In our midst are persons from many backgrounds and religions. Many formerly had no true concept of God and his purpose for man. (P. 5) Some who became spirit-anointed Christians had been like that, but came to know and be known by God. Similar with some here. (Gal. 4:8, 9; pp. 6, 7) Are you progressively coming to know God better? Is it affecting you for good?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Come to know Him as an eternal God of purpose. </span><span class="font10">(20 min.) We should know him as everlasting, for he is eternal. (Ps. 90:2-4; p. 7) He thus can have eternal purpose. (Eph. 3:10, 11; p. 13) Even his name should reveal that to us. (Pp. 14-16) Really to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font10"> Him involves more; we need to appreciate his reliability in carrying out his will. If we do, can confidently build our lives around his purposes. God’s reliability was shown by his determined will regarding Assyrian Empire. (Isa. 14:24-27; pp. 18, 19) His “counsel” or decrees stand. Do we appreciate what this means regarding wicked of our day? (Prov. 16:3, 4; pp. 17, 18, ££22, 23; p. 23, £34) It should strengthen our confidence in certainty of his prophecies. Are we, with confidence in God’s counsel, bringing lives into harmony with his good purpose? (Ps. 33:9-12; pp. 24, 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind was created to harmonize with God’s purpose.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) God purposed to become a Father, and first produced spirits. (Pp. 26, 27) Angels interested in carrying out his will and helping us be holy. (P. 31) Creation of man reflects God’s loving interest. (Ps. 103:13, 14; pp. 33, 34) Proved He is loving provider. (Pp. 35, 41) Made man perfect, and placed him in Paradise with a purpose. (Gen. 2:7, 8, 15; pp. 37, 40) Had prospect of eternal life. (P. 43) Death would come only from disobedience. (P. 44, read £33; p. 62, £25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Choose to harmonize your life with God’s purpose. </span><span class="font10">(15 min.) Man and woman were not created aimless, but in accord with His purpose. (P. 45) Stated purpose was good for man, to lead to an earth-wide paradise. (Gen. 1:27, 28; pp. 48, 49) Angels rejoiced in progress of God’s purpose. (P. 51) Goal was earth fully populated with happy worshipers by end of seventh “day.” (Read V18.) That day continues, so we can enter into God’s rest in spiritual way; will we? (Pp. 52, 53, read 1124.) Are we choosing to serve God, to harmonize our life with all we know of him? We can be sure his purpose will succeed; will we? Our eternal salvation and happiness depend on it. (P. 25, V40)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">2. God’s Purpose Sustained in the Face of Rebellion (po chapters 5-7)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Do you believe rebellion against God can succeed? </span><span class="font10">(5 min.) Rebellion is common. Sometimes on personal basis, as student against teacher. Often on national basis. Usually stern efforts are employed to deal with rebels. (Prov. 17:11) But some succeed —North American colonies against England. Could rebellion against God succeed? How would rebellion affect God’s purposes? How much confidence do you have in God’s accomplishing his purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">His purpose continued despite rebellion in heaven and on earth.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) Original purpose was to populate earth with true worshipers. (P. 61, 1J21) God did not desire man to die. (Ezek. 18:23; pp. 54, 55) Through serpent, an unseen spirit led Eve to rebel. (P. 57, read 1J11.) She followed course of that rebellious spirit. (P. 59, fil6) In face of rebellion, did God abandon purpose? No. God’s sustaining of His purpose evident in allowing Adam and Eve to procreate. (Gen. 3:16) Reinforced it by forming purpose to have anointed one who would crush Rebel. (Gen. 3:14, 15; pp. 59-61; p. 64, 1T29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Examples of those who cooperated with God’s purpose.</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Since first humans rebelled, how could God produce “seed”? Bible focuses on His doing so. (P. 65, ^2) Did death of Abel thwart God’s purpose? No. Used Seth. (P. 66) Enoch stuck to God and his purpose even in face of danger to life. Would we? (Pp. 68-70, read 5115.) Noah walked with God for centuries, not quitting. Do we show patient obedience? (Gen. 6:9, 10; p. 71) Finally God brought Flood to cut short wickedness; showed he was in control. (Pp. 72, 73) By preserving Noah and family, God also preserved line of “seed.” (P. 75, V29; p. 77, read fi35.) Wicked spirits still active. (P. 78, V38) Rebellion did not defeat God’s purpose; faithful ones stuck to it. (Pp. 79, 80)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">History of “seed’s” line shows purpose was sustained.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) Gould Satan thwart purpose by preventing “seed’s” appearance? (P. 81, fll) Line was through Shem; blessing was in accord with Shem’s respect for God’s dealing. (P. 83) Centuries later God promised “seed” through Abraham. (Gen. 12:1-3; p. 85) Isaac’s birth gave assurance God could produce “seed.” (Gen. 3:15; p. 87, T[15) Mel-chizedek blessed Abraham; prefigured coming kingly “seed.” (Pp. 88, 89) Because of faith, Abraham was God’s “friend.” (Isa. 41:8; p. 90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Will we, like Enoch, Noah and Abraham, be patient and loyal, confident that nothing thwarts God’s purpose? (P. 80)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">3. A Nation’s Role in Developing God’s “Eternal Purpose” (po chapters 8-10)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God can irresistibly use a nation.</span><span class="font10"> (5 min.) Nations now strive for power and full independence; have strong armies, powerful weapons. But does any nation have God’s approval, being used to accomplish His purpose? Could any nation resist his will? Answers affect our view of life and how we use it. Nebuchadnezzar was forced to acknowledge correct conclusion. (Dan. 4:34, 35) God’s ability to choose irresistibly to use a nation is seen in Bible record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God himself would do choosing in working out purpose.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) Had made covenant to bring “seed” through Abraham’s descendants. (Gen. 12: 1-3, 7) In selecting one of Isaac’s sons, God was not bound by right of firstborn. (Pp. 93, 94, read fl4.) Choice of Jacob explains why Bible focuses on his line. (P. 95) Through which son would Messiah come? Again, God adapted to circumstances; selected Judah. (Pp. 96, 97, 100) Royal leadership not bound to firstborn. (1 Chron. 5:1, 2; p. 101) Bible record aids in following progress of purpose; of interest, as our future is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God chose a nation.</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Before giving Abraham’s descendants Promised Land, allowed time for nation to grow. (Gen. 15:18-21; p. 104) Proves He acts according to his schedule. (Pp. 105, 106) Would use Moses as mediator of covenant, but Moses had to wait on God. (P. 107, 5111) Opposition of powerful Egypt could not stop purpose. (Pp. 108, 109) Through mediator, nation indicated willingness to be in covenant. (Ex. 24:6-8; p. 113) If they kept Law flawlessly, could gain life. They could not; neither could we, showing need for “seed.” (Lev. 18:5; pp. 117, 118) Still, nation with Law was used in leading to “seed” and so developing purpose. (P. 116)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">From this nation God chose line of kings leading to “seed.”</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) God allowed time for nation to be guided by judges. (Pp. 120-122) Saul of tribe of Benjamin selected as king. Was God abandoning stated will about Judah? No. When Saul went bad, God chose David of Judah. (1 Sam. 13:13, 14; p. 123) After being selected, David waited on God to become ruler of whole nation. (P. 124) God covenanted with him for dynasty of kings. (2 Sam. 7:12-16; pp. 126-128) End of human kings of David’s line did not stop God’s purpose; line still led to Jesus and everlasting Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Evident that God can do what he wants with individuals or nations. (Job 34:29) Do we follow’ his leading of a unified people today? Confidence that he is working out his purpose leads to blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will you accept opportunities for life open to you?</span><span class="font10"> (10 min.) Sane person, if given opportunity to enjoy a rich and rewarding life, will accept. When Israel given choice between life and death, chose correctly. (Deut. 30:19, 20; Josh. 24:15-18) Later had opportunity to identify and accept promised Messiah. Some accepted Jesus. Do we believe he is Messiah? Could we prove it? Does our life indicate we accept his leadership?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven involved in appearance of Messiah of God’s purpose.</span><span class="font10"> (25 min.) Coming of Anointed One was important in accomplishing God’s purpose. (P. 64, ^29) Long in advance God indicated time and place of Messiah’s appearance. (Dan. 9:24-27; Mic. 5:2; pp. 130-134) Jesus’ appearance thus is evidence he is Messiah. But in other ways heaven was involved, supporting Messiahship. Angels communicated with Mary and Joseph before His birth, highlighting role as king and Messianic sin-remover. (Luke 1:26-33; Matt. 1:20, 21; pp. 134, 5[10, 139, 142) Was of right lineage to be David’s heir. (Pp. 135, 136, 142, 5[32) Child conceived was holy. (P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">137) By angelic action shepherds were eyewitnesses to birth, and child’s life saved. (Pp. 140-143) Is also eyewitness testimony that God anointed Jesus. (P. 144) Questions remain: Did Jews accept Jesus? Do we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Messiah’s course fulfilled prophecy and gives us assurance for future.</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Messiah was to suffer, and be like Moses. (Isa. 53:7, 9, 12; Deut. 18:15, 18; pp. 146-148) Performed many miracles greater than Moses’. (Ex 7:2, 3; John 2:23; 3:1, 2; p. 149) Do we appreciate what his miracles indicate? Is Messiah. Also suggest what he can do in future—healing, raising dead. Do we believe that under his rulership people will not be sick, hungry, sad? As a prophet he foretold own death and many things we see happening today. (P. 150) His death as sacrifice important for God’s “eternal purpose” to be accomplished. (Isa. 53:9, 12; pp. 152, 153) Raised as a spirit and able to present in heaven value of life that is vital for our eternal Efe. (Pp. 154, 155, read ffl[22, 23.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even at time of death, Jesus had God’s purpose of earthly Paradise in mind. (P. 152, 1[17) Now is ruling in heaven. Are we following his directions? (Heb. 5:8, 9; Matt. 24:14, 43, 44)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Do you appreciate God’s patience in working out purpose'?</span><span class="font10"> (5 min.) All people are impatient at times; are we, regarding God’s purpose? (P. 188, V3) Patient development of purpose allows us to benefit, learning of it and lining up with it. Dealings regarding complete “seed” show God wants humans to benefit. (2 Pet. 3:9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God gradually developed purpose involving full “seed.”</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Identity of “seed” and what it would accomplish was long a secret. Jesus came as Messiah and principal “seed,” but more was involved. (Gen. 22:17, 18; p. 161, fil2) God’s purpose included an administration, his way of doing things that would result in a unification under Christ. (Pp. 156, 157) On Pentecost 33 C.E. Jesus began to build congregation, replacing natural Israel with spiritual “Israel of God.” (Pp. 158-160) Spirit-anointed became part of Abraham’s seed; Jews first. (Acts 3:24-26; p. 162) Later extended to Gentiles, ones formerly with “no hope.” God’s patience was thus great benefit to them. (Eph. 2:11, 12; p. 164) This settled “sacred secret.” (Eph. 3:5, 6, 10-12; pp. 167, 168) Dealings verify God’s wisdom and patience. We are in position to benefit. But will we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Progressive purpose allows us to gain eternal life. </span><span class="font10">(20 min.) Can be confident God’s purpose will triumph, despite efforts to thwart it. (P. 169) No benefit to be gained from Christendom. (2 Pet. 2:1-3; pp. 170, 171, read 04, 5-) Live at crucial time since 1914. (Pp. 173-178) Anointed have not missed using opportunity to honor Jehovah, even took on Name. (P. 179) Is evidence purpose is triumphing. (P. 180) Since “all nations”—not just spiritual Israel —blessed, we can uphold, benefit from purpose. (Pp. 181-184) “Tribulation” ahead, so may be problems and inconvenience for ones loyal to purpose, but “great crowd” will survive. (P. 185)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Must decide now what you will do.</span><span class="font10"> (10 min.) Full accomplishment of purpose will bring great joy. Dead will benefit through resurrection. (Pp. 187, 188) Satan and other rebels will not benefit; be destroyed. Are we now proving we are not of that kind? Congregation involved in God’s “eternal purpose.” (Eph. 3:10, 11) Are we loyally working with it? Prepares us to benefit from Kingdom during Millennium.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">It is reasonable that humans should live longer. </span><span class="font10">(7 min.) We love life; do not want it to end. Much Bible counsel based on our love of life. (1 Pet. 3:10; Prov. 3:1, 2) We associate life with learning, enjoying, experiencing. Does not seem reasonable that man should have such short life. (Discuss briefly illustrations on pages 4 and 24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Death affects lives and thinking of persons earth wide.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) Most religions are death-oriented. Often person’s efforts in life molded by realization of death. (Pp. 5, 6) Common to hear people use expressions that reflect widespread belief in fate. Bible does not support view that life-span is set by fate. (Pp. 9-12, draw attention to illustration.) Since death seems inevitable, many people live for the moment. (1 Cor. 15:32; pp. 13, 14) Even believers in Bible do well to reflect on meaning of death, and how are using life. (Eccl. 7:1-4; pp. 15, 16) Bible acknowledges fundamental questions about life and death that we need answered. (P. 8, read ^3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Man was made to live.</span><span class="font10"> (8 min.) Man’s physical makeup and concept of eternity indicate he was made to live; death is unnatural. (Eccl. 3:10, 11; pp. 17-22) Then, why does he die? (Pp. 23-26)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">How death came about.</span><span class="font10"> (10 min.) Myths of many peoples reflect idea that death resulted from disobedience. (Pp. 27-29) Bible shows man was created with prospect of life, with death resulting only from disobedience. (Pp. 30-33, discuss p. 32; Gen 2:16, 17) Sin brought death, which spread to Adam’s descendants. (Rom. 5:12; pp. 34, 35) But does something survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The whole “soul” dies.</span><span class="font10"> (15 min.) Many pagans and others believe man has immortal soul. (Pp. 35-37) Bible, though, indicates that humans and animals are souls, breathers. (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:45; Deut. 24:7; pp. 37-41, discuss p. 40.) One can lose his life as a soul. (Gen. 35:18; pp. 42, 43) Idea of immortal soul is of pagan origin, likely stemming from ancient Babel. (Pp. 43-45) Since Bible does not uphold this false teaching, is it sensible to be part of organization that does? Creator wants you to live; made you to do so. Why not learn what Bible says about how we can? (Acts 13:48)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ideas about life after death affect many people. </span><span class="font10">(5 min.) People around us reflect belief in life after death. Many believe conscious spirit leaves body at death, perhaps going to heaven, hell or purgatory. Some fear such spirits, trying to drive them away. Others attempt to communicate with them. Because certain things seem familiar, some wonder if they lived before birth. Does Bible give guidance? It should, being God’s Word. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">conscious spirit survives death of body.</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Bible says dead are unconscious. (Ps. 146:4; Eccl. 9:5, 10; p. 73, ^2) Does Bible support view that conscious spirit leaves body at death? Let us consider: Ecclesiastes 12:7 is said to teach this, but “spirit” is invisible life-force. (Ps. 104:29; Eccl. 3:19; pp. 47-49) Can in some ways be compared to electricity. (Pp. 50, 51, discuss illustration.) “Returns” to God in sense that he has authority over it. (Luke 23:46; pp. 52, 53) How about thoughts of having lived before? (Read p. 53, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup>f4,</span><span class="font10"> 5.) Familiarity does not prove rebirth, which is contrary to Bible. (P. 54) What about John 9:2? Does not conflict. (Pp. 59, 60)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Living need not try to help dead nor fear them. </span><span class="font10">(10 min.) Efforts to appease dead sometimes reflected in funeral practices. (Pp. 60-63) Church teaching of purgatory based on tradition, not Bible; runs contrary to Scriptures. (Matt. 15:6-9; 6:7, 8; pp. 64-69, call attention to illustrations.) Avoiding cemeteries, using juju priest, etc.,—evidence fear of spirits of dead. (Pp. 69-73) Bible helps us to have correct view. (Eccl. 9:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Avoid “talking with dead” and similar unscrip-tural practices.</span><span class="font10"> (20 min.) Some seem to be able to contact dead; how? Did King Saul contact dead Samuel? (1 Sam. 28:12-15; pp. 74, 75, note illustration on p. 77.) Jehovah would not have approved or permitted such to occur. (Lev. 19:31; pp. 76, 77) What is source of such voices? Similar to experience of Eve. (Gen. 3:1-6) Jesus showed lying source was Satan. (John 8:44; pp. 79-81) Other spirit creatures joined Satan, becoming demons; now in “Tartarus.” (Gen. 6:1-4; pp. 83-85) We must be on guard against their efforts to contact and influence humans. (P. 86, read V1X 2.) Bible advises us to avoid spiritistic practices. (Lev. 20:27; pp. 87, 88)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">See God for what he is—loving, merciful, kind. </span><span class="font10">(5 min.) Bible abundantly testifies to God’s mercy, kindness, love. (Ps. 103:8, 13, 14) We can recognize this from good things he provides for all, even ones ignoring him. (Acts 14:17) Some teachings, even ones claimed to be from Bible, present distorted, untrue picture of God. Need to clear up these matters and have correct view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word does not teach torment in fiery hell. </span><span class="font10">(25 min.) Earlier talks in series proved dead are not conscious, man has no immortal soul but is a soul; God retains power to resurrect faithful. Yet many, including pagans, teach punishment in fiery hell. (Pp. 88-91, call attention to illustrations.) What does Bible refer to as “hell”? Hebrew </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sh<sup>e</sup>’ohl' </span><span class="font10">and Greek </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hai’des,</span><span class="font10"> sometimes translated “hell,” refer to place of dead, mankind’s common grave. (Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:30, 31; pp. 91-95) Harmonizes with fact that God sets as penalty death, not torment. (Deut. 30:19, 20; p. 93) Doctrine of hell of torment probably comes from Greek and Roman ideas. (P. 96, read ^3.) It slanders God. (Pp. 96, 97) How, then, can we understand Luke 16:19-31? (Read passage and call attention to illustration on pp. 100, 101.) Clergy view is illogical. (Prov. 30:8; pp. 101, 102) “Rich man” and “Lazarus” are figurative. (Matt. 23:5-7; 21:31, 32; pp. 102, 103) Their “death” is change in situation. (Rom. 7:2, 4; p. 106) “Rich man” class tormented by Christian message. (Acts 5:33; pp. 107, 108) This Scriptural view does not malign God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Just God punishes unreformable ones with destruction.</span><span class="font10"> (17 min.) Reasonable that a just God would punish unreformably wicked, but in accord with his qualities; excludes eternal suffering. View borne out by Bible’s comments about Gehenna; based on total destruction of refuse. (Mark 9:43-48; 2 Chron. 28:1, 3; 2 Ki. 23:10; pp. 110-115) Symbol of everlasting destruction. (P. 115, read ^3.) Persons and things thus destroyed are spoken of as being tormented forever. (Rev. 20:10; pp. 117-119) Means being confined under reproach forever. (Matt. 18:34, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font10"> p. 120, ^2) This is consistent with other Bible indications of God’s personality.

Are familiar with Revelation 21: 3, 4, but how accomplished and what w’ill it mean? Will be ample food. (Pp. 134-137; Isa. 25:6) Jesus will heal sickness, gradually or instantaneously, as need may be. (Isa. 25:8; pp. 137-139) Can be confident he and associate rulers will deal sympathetically. (Heb. 4:15, 16; pp. 140, 141) Endless life free from sickness will not be boring; much to learn and do. (Pp. 144-148) Endless opportunities to express love. (Pp. 149, 150, read p. 150, ][2.) Is “near at hand” since we are at threshold of New Order. Dream of “tree” in Daniel chapter 4 gives prophetic indication of time for Kingdom’s establishment. (Pp. 152, 153) Signifies period of 2,520 years. (Very briefly call attention to pp. 155-162; note illustration, and read ^4 on p. 162.) End of wicked system to come in this “generation.” (Matt. 24:34; p. 163) Does prospect of never dying, but of gaining blessings of New Order, move us to praise God?</span></p>

For Isaiah 65:17 to prove true in New Order, dead must be raised. (Pp. 166, 167) Past resurrections show it can be accomplished. (Acts 17:31; pp. 167-169) God unquestionably is able to resurrect dead. (Pp. 171-173; Ps. 139:16) This should help us dispel fear of violent death. (Heb. 2:14; pp. 174, 175) All details as to arrangements for resurrected are not now needed. (Pp. 176, 177) Bible does say resurrected ones will not marry. Death now ends marriage, and survivors free to remarry if they choose; is a kindness that God has told us this. (Pp. 178-180) Bible indicates that some will not be raised, emphasizing importance of maintaining loyalty now.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The elder arrangement has been functioning in a fine manner in the congregations as in apostolic days. That Jehovah’s blessing has been richly upon it is indicated by the unity among the elders, ministerial servants and publishers, and also the increases that continue to take place. We do enjoy our increased spiritual prosperity! So that further improvements might be made in the arrangement here are some suggestions that undoubtedly will benefit the elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When elders or ministerial servants move, the committee should notify the governing body of this departure so that the names can be deleted from our records for that congregation. When deletions are recommended for other reasons, then the committee, writing for the body of elders, should send complete and specific reasons for the recommendation. For example, a brother may request that he be removed, doing this for personal reasons. Of course, in such a case the elders should discuss the matter with the brother. Is he really disqualified Scripturally? Or is it simply that there are circumstances that hinder him from doing as much as he would like? Can the elders be of any help? If, after this discussion, he still feels he should be deleted, then the governing body should be notified, with sufficient information given so that the reasons are made clear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In recommending other deletions, the Scriptural requirement that the brother fails to meet should be specified and then information as to what he has done, or failed to do, to warrant deletion ought to be given. (1 Tim. 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9) Sometimes a letter recommending deletion simply says it is because the brother now devotes little time to the field service. This really is not sufficient information. The Bible does not specify a certain minimum hour requirement or specify certain times or manner of spreading the good news in order to qualify as an</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Fine Opportunities , </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">of love among all of us who are serving Jehovah. As the apostle Peter wrote: “The end of all things has drawn close. . . . Above all things, have intense love for one another.” (1 Pet. 4:7, 8) If we do this, rich blessings will be ours during this new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Governing Body</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">elder. It is certainly to be hoped that all elders and ministerial servants will do whatever they can to aid the congregation to have a large share in the Kingdom proclamation. But individual circumstances vary and each one must do what he feels he can, as his faith and love move him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When a brother’s field activity shows some decrease or he misses some meetings, rather than recommend his deletion as an elder or ministerial servant, the elders should consider his circumstances. Possibly his health or that of some member of his family has not been good. It could be that he is on a different shift in his secular work or has a new job. He might have debts that he must care for and so is working overtime temporarily, though not being materialistic in this. Or maybe he has been discouraged or spiritually low for a time and would benefit from some encouragement. Of course, if he were to downgrade or minimize to others the importance of the witness work or of the meetings, this could be serious. But simply that his activity is not equal to that of some others would not in itself be a basis for his removal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes letters recommending deletion are received stating it is because of “improper conduct.” Here, too, it would be good to provide further information. What did he do? Was he really involved in serious wrongdoing requiring reproof with a restricting of privileges? Or possibly he just made a mistake, using poor judgment on an occasion, with the congregation still having respect for him and confidence in him as an elder or ministerial servant. Maybe the matter has not become widely known, if at all. If he appreciates that what he did was not wise, has learned a good lesson from the experience and has a good attitude, wanting to improve, then he might be retained. These thoughts will help the body of elders to get a full and balanced view of the matter and then they will be able to report fully in their letter, setting forth their recommendations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>G</sup> All of us appreciate very much the excellent work being done by the elders and ministerial servants as a whole in our congregations. Following these suggestions will make for a more smoothly operating organization as we work together in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Teaching at Congregation Book Studies</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Whether we have been studying the Bible for a few years or many, our knowledge and appreciation continue to grow. The congregation book study has certainly played its part in our spiritual growth. There are times when our discussions center on very deep spiritual matters, which Jehovah has provided in his Word for the encouragement and upbuilding of his people. Are you finding greater delight in the deeper things of the Bible than you did in the past? A positive view of “solid food,” coupled with determination to make it our own, will contribute much to continued spiritual advancement.—Heb. 5:11-6:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The book study conductor can, of course, do much in seeing to it that those in his group get the most from the spiritual food. It should be his desire to help all in attendance to progress. To this end, he does well not to dwell too long on a paragraph, trying to draw out comments on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">everything </span><span class="font10">in each sentence. Those studying will make more progress if there is a reasonable amount of coverage of the book at each study. They will be aided thereby to get a better overall picture of what is being taught, and will avoid drawing wrong conclusions because of treating secondary details as if they were the main points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The best way to ensure a good, effective book study is for the conductor, first, to study the lesson and to have clearly in mind the main points therein. He can also select appropriate scriptures to be read. (If he does not know the answer to a question, he might do </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">With many district assemblies beginning this month, baptisms increased and we are thrilled to report that 12,300 new brothers and sisters were added to the congregations. This makes a total of 63,569 baptized in the first ten months of the service year; 7,794 more than all last year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is also encouraging to note that 886,685 Bibles and books were placed. This is over 155,000 more than were placed last June! Of course, we will want to cultivate this growing interest in God’s Word by making return visits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the value of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines in providing much strengthening spiritual food for them. They also recognize that these magazines have been powerful instruments in ‘opening the blind eyes’ and in feeding thousands who spiritually hunger and thirst for God’s Word.—Isa. 42:7; Matt. 5:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The special issues of these magazines for October are designed to help many who ‘sigh and groan’ because of the bad conditions in the earth. (Ezek. 9:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> contains the assembly public address “Human Plans Failing as God’s Purpose Succeeds.” The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> special issue entitled “Does God Care?” answers a question that is perhaps most frequently asked, namely, Why has God permitted wickedness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In using this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">you can arouse interest by asking a few of the questions in the article “Does God Care About Mankind?” Then you can call attention to the title of the article “When and Where Things Went Wrong” and “How God Has Actively Shown His Care.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Or, you may use only the article “Human Suffering—Due to Whose Failure to Care?” After pointing out the apparent dilemma set out in paragraphs three and four, you can follow up with the offer of the magazine, saying that it provides the answer. When having a more extended discussion, you could epitomize the entire ar-gument in this article. Show that it is not any lack in the earth’s power to produce that is at fault. Rather, man’s greed and his mishandling of earth’s resources have brought about poverty, pollution and devastation of large areas of the earth. After discussing these points briefly, show the householder the special magazine that gives details on God’s purpose to remedy these things and to bless mankind. Offer the subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The article “How Much Do You Care?”, which is quite brief, may be used as a stepping-stone to a home Bible study. You can later switch to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font10"> book. If the householder shows unusual interest, or when you make a return visit after placing this issue, read and discuss it together, if possible. This article makes an appeal to the person’s love of good things and his desire for peace and life for himself and his family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In highlighting the special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> you may wish briefly to call attention to the failure of human plans for a better world, and ask, ‘But has God been doing anything—do you think he is working out a purpose toward earth?’ Where the householder replies, you may turn to the article “Human Plans Failing as God’s Purpose Succeeds.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Often we find people who say, ‘Our church is about the same as yours.’ Others do not know much about Jehovah’s witnesses. They often have distorted ideas about us. If the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses comes up—why they call at “Christian” homes, what their purpose is, and so forth—the article “How Are Jehovah’s Witnesses Different?” may be used. Paragraphs dealing with the question asked may be referred to.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The people need to know that God does care and that he is doing something now for them toward the completion of a grand purpose for the earth.

Their advance preparation will also make their comments more meaningful and helpful to others in attendance. The conductor may, therefore, wish to announce the portion of the material that will likely be covered at the next study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The conductor ought to help the group to appreciate how the material is of value to them. On occasion he might highlight a specific point from the material, making an application for the benefit of the group.

<p><span class="font8">• Is it fitting to display the Hebrew or English letters of the Tetragrammaton on automobiles, jewelry and other items?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is a matter that should rightly be left for each Witness to decide, based on the dictates of his own conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nevertheless, circumstances vary and what may be appropriate in one locality may not be fitting in another area. Eor example, where there is considerable prejudice against Jews, displaying the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew letters could give rise to needless problems due to mistaken identity. And some Jews themselves find the public display of the Tetragrammaton objectionable. Also, in some areas there are other reasons why such a practice might be viewed as strange and so create misunderstandings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, some have found that displaying the Tetragrammaton either in English or Hebrew letters has aroused curiosity and given openings for informal witnessing. Then, too, it has served as a means of identifying other Witnesses when traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a person should decide to display the Tetragrammaton on his car, he should also appreciate the responsibility of not misrepresenting it by disregard for Caesar s laws or by careless and inconsiderate driving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As Jehovah’s servants we are responsible to uphold the dignity of his name. This is done primarily by preaching and by setting a good example in Christian living. Should the public display of the Tetragrammaton detract from that, it w<sup>r</sup>ould obviously not be fitting. Furthermore, we do not want to give others the impression that the Tetragrammaton is the symbol of Jehovah’s witnesses as a whole. We have no organizational symbol to identify ourselves but show that we are Jehovah’s Christian witnesses by living in harmony with God’s will.—John 13: </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">35.</span><span class="font8">___________________</span></p>

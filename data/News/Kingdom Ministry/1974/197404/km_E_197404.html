<p><span class="font12">Jehovah is richly blessing his people as he promised he would. A veritable “cloud” of people is flocking to the place of safety. (Isa. 60:8) As you know, in the United States, 525,007 publishers were in the field service in December, when </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 17 was distributed. And the cold month of January saw 489,496 reporting—our second-highest peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With similar increases in other lands, there is a tremendous demand for Bibles and books. To supply your needs the Brooklyn factory has produced over 18,000,-000 books this service year, 44 percent more than it did during the same months last year. Fifteen rotary presses are busy printing Bibles alone! But orders are flooding in faster than we can fill them. During the same time, distributors’ copies of the magazines for the U.S. have totaled 95,727,068—up 17 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That is why, on February 14, Brother Knorr wrote to all congregations in the United States about Bethel service. We are confident that Jehovah’s spirit will prompt many of you to rise to the occasion. Are you a brother, born in 1955 or earlier, baptized for at least one year? Are you single and healthy? Are you free and willing to use your time and energies to help in meeting these needs of our brothers world? wide?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With response from you brothers who qualify, the demand can be met. As an example: The Brooklyn factory now keeps ten bindery “lines” going daily. Here the books are taken through their final stages and packed. It is there that help is especially needed. Half of these lines are now also running a night shift. You brothers coming in could release experienced brothers to volunteer for the night shift, thus keeping all the bindery equipment busy day and night. In this way we could produce an additional three quarters of a million books a month. Publishers around the world</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Prove Whose Side You Support </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom News No. 18 Stresses the Issue</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How long have you been serving Jehovah? A few of us may say, “More than thirty years,” others, “Fifteen years.” But did you realize that fully one third of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States —about 175,000—would say, “Less than five years”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Is it not a thrill to see so many taking their stand on Jehovah’s side? And no matter how -long we have been supporting God’s government, are we not delighted to have ceased being vessels for Satan’s use and to have become vessels useful to our rightful owner, Jehovah God? —2 Tim. 2:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What helped you to take your stand on Jehovah’s side so as to be useful to Him? It was getting an understanding of the Bible, was it not? Often the starting point is reading </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> As you continued to read </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">you appreciated it more and more. Has that appreciation been moving you to be enthusiastic about offering </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscriptions to others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps, though, despite your efforts, you have not placed even one subscription during the campaign. Have you thought about sending a gift subscription?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In Germany a woman and her daughter came to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study for the first time. It was learned that a relative had sent the mother a gift subscription, and by reading the magazines she learned that she had only a short time left to become acquainted would be grateful to get them. And think what an expanded witness could thus be given!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Can you volunteer? If so, speak to the elders of your congregation, and write the Society for an application today.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Do you have a relative, acquaintance or work associate that you feel would benefit from having a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription? If so, why not subscribe for that person during April? When submitting a gift subscription, be sure to mark “Gift” on the upper right-hand corner of the subscription slip, and print your name clearly on the bottom of the slip as the giver.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> As you know, Wb have some fine special issues of the magazines for distribution in April. No doubt you are already making good use of some of them. Have you considered that persons with whom you are studying may enjoy the privilege of helping you to distribute the very timely information in these magazines? First, review the requirements for new publishers, as set out on page 129 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book, to be sure that they qualify. Then, why not ask them to go with you in the magazine work? April is a good time to get them started. Then, during May, they will no doubt want to have a part in giving out that exciting new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font12"> No. 18.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING APRIL 14</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 51. Introduction, with very brief comments on text. Discuss how to offer special “Watchtower” and “Awake!” in field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3 min: Accounts report, if not previously presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Prove Whose Side You Support.” Question-and-answer coverage of paragraphs 1-7 of article. Include experiences from audience as to how and when they have obtained subscriptions; especially emphasize the sending of gift subscriptions. Discuss, too, aiding new ones who qualify to share in the field ministry during April. Include comments that are directed to these potential praisers of Jehovah; many of them will be there in the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Overcoming Efforts to Make Us Compromise. After brief introductory comments, draw audience into discussion, using questions provided. Apportion material carefully so that all the scriptures are considered and so that some experiences are covered from each of the numbered sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Invite brief comments on the following scriptures as to what they show that we as Christians are to do and what we should avoid in our contacts with the world. (1) Romans 13:1, 7; Acts 5:29; (2) 1 Peter 2:17, compare it with Acts 12:21-23 and Matthew 4:10; (3) John 6:15; James 4:4; Revelation 14:9, 10, 12; (4) Isaiah 2:4 and Matthew 22:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have prepared publishers relate the following “1974 Yearbook” experiences, taking some from each section as time permits. Ask audience to point out how the scriptures already discussed show the Christian course to follow under such circumstances: (1) “yb,” p. 133, pars. 2-4; p. 136, par. 4 to 137, par. 1; (2) “yb,” p. 118, par. 1; (3) &quot;yb,” p. 115, par. 4 to p. 117, par. 2; (4) “yb,” p. 187, par. 3; p. 189, par. 4; p. 204, par. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah rightly requires exclusive devotion; we cannot compromise his righteous principles and still serve him. He will help us to be faithful if that is what truly is in our hearts. So determined were brothers in Germany to obey Jehovah that even when in concentration camps they openly witnessed despite threats of opposers. —“yb,” p. 203, pars. 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Earnestly discuss what the Branch Letter says about the need for workers at Bethel. In preparation for the meeting next week, encourage all to study carefully the March 1, 1974, “Watchtower” article on prayer. Song 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING APRIL 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Song 9. Introduction, text and comments. You might use a family setting, and include discussion of recent items from “Watching the World” in &quot;Awake!”, also appropriate Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 </span><span class="font1">min: </span><span class="font11">Distribution of Kingdom News No. 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Briefly review with audience contents of Kingdom News No. 18. (Distribute sample copies before meeting.) Then draw out comments from the audience as to why this message is such an important one. (In advance, provide several mature publishers with copies of the tract, and ask them to have brief comments ready as to the importance of the message.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Discuss, with audience participation, paragraphs 8-12 of the article &quot;Prove Whose Side You Support.” Encourage united effort on the part of the congregation in tract distribution on May 4 and 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">20 min: </span><span class="font11">“What Is the Quality of Your Prayers?” Discussion with audience, based on article in the March 1, 1974, &quot;Watchtower.” Develop main ideas so they will be remembered. Invite audience to read and comment on selected scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: Concluding comments. Frpm Society’s letter of March 1 “To All Field Overseers,” share experiences about results from Kingdom News distribution. Analyze with the congregation Paul’s attitude toward the preaching of the good news as expressed at 1 Corinthians 9:16. Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING APRIL 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Song 65. Introduction, text and comments. Include information on “District Assembly Plans,” giving special attention to material that is pertinent to the congregation; some material may not apply locally. Enthusiastically encourage the brothers to attend the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: If Brothers Prove False. After brief introductory remarks, draw remaining points from audience with questions. Have some publishers prepared to relate experiences from &quot;1974 Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vital that we have deep appreciation for our brothers. Proper view will help when times are difficult. Jesus said, &quot;All you are brothers.” He said genuine Christians would manifest genuine love for one another. (Matt. 23:8; John 13:35) Ask audience: (1) Though a brother may speak unkindly or not agree with us on some matter, why should we not hastily view him as an enemy? (Rom. 3:23; Jas. 2:13; &quot;yb,” pp. 174, 175) (2) Some, out of weakness, may fail to maintain integrity under severe pressure. Does this necessarily mean that such ones are our enemies? (Matt. 26:69-75: Gal. 6:1; &quot;yb,” p. 178, par. 3; p. 168, par. 2) (3) What will identify one who professes to be a brother as false to that claim? (Matt. 26:14-16, 48, 49; Jude 4, 8; 2 Pet. 2:1) (4) During time of intense persecution, how has Satan used some who professed to be Christian brothers? (“yb,” pp. 53, 148, 178, 179) (5) Why might the enemy want to give us the impression that some of our brothers had betrayed us? So how should we view charges heard from such a source? (“yb,” p. 231; Ps. 144:11) (6) If a brother does prove false, how should we view our other brothers? (1 Pet. 1:22; 1 John 4:7, 20, 21) (7) How can we guard ourselves so that we do not betray our brothers? —Prov. 22:19; Matt. 10:28; Acts 20:24; “yb,” p. 210, par. 2; p. 175, par. 4 to p. 176, par. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our brotherhood is a gift from Jehovah. We love our brothers. (1 John 3:14) Do not let the enemy destroy your confidence in your faithful brothers. As to God’s faithful people, we reflect Paul’s spirit as expressed at 2 Thessalonians 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Reporting Our Field Service. Distribute a Publisher’s Field Service Report slip and a Bible Study Report slip to each one in attendance. Remind them that this is the time to turn in their reports for the month. Discuss problems that have been observed locally in the use of these report slips. (For example, even literature that is left at a not-at-home is to be counted; save fractions of hours until there is a full hour to report; include time used in informal witnessing; what to count as a return visit; how to report home Bible studies.) Comment briefly on why we turn in reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Build up enthusiasm for the distribution of Kingdom News No. 18. Encourage all to participate early; remind them that the work is to be completed by May 12. If any realize that they will be unable to distribute their complete allotment, request that they return these as early as possible so that others will have opportunity to use them during the following week. Song 116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING MAY 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Song 12. Introduction, text and comments. Make use of appropriate Theocratic News items to show joy in serving Jehovah shared by ever-increasing number of brothers world wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: &quot;What Is the Bible’s View?” ’There is a wealth of material in &quot;Awake!” articles bearing this heading. Each one provides a concise treatment of a Bible subject that may be just what is needed to reach someone you have contacted in field ministry, someone you work with, go to school with, a relative or a neighbor. List subjects covered in recent months. Demonstrate father talking with son on challenge son faces in school on loose morals. Cover material in January 22, 1974, &quot;Awake!” on the subject “Fornication—Why Not?” In handling this, chairman can emphasize that this material can be very beneficial to parents who want to help their children to have the Bible’s view on matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Offering the Book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discuss use of the Bible in house-to-house ministry. In distributing tracts and in placing magazines we use brief presentations. These activities serve a good purpose. Also beneficial to endeavor to draw people into conversation, to discuss points from the Bible. Many new publishers may never have done this; it is not difficult; we encourage you to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Several publishers on platform discuss and demonstrate how to draw householder into conversation, and then read just one or two verses from the Bible. (Keep it simple.) Offer “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.” (Use ideas from October 1973 &quot;Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —Developing Interest on Return Visits.” Talk on material, including some audience participation, and handled possibly by Bible study overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Concluding comments. Briefly discuss Question Box; enlarge on it if it applies locally. Build up enthusiasm for final weekend of distribution of Kingdom News No. 18. Song 11.</span></p>

Please read it.” It is best to place the tract in the householder’s hand as you speak. Also, leave a copy for each household where no one is at home; but the tracts are not meant for general distribution on the streets.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">Developing Interest on Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> To develop interest in the truth requires time. Do you schedule sufficient time to make return visits on a regular basis? Many publishers find it beneficial to spend at least half of their field service time in making return visits and conducting Bible studies, thus cultivating interest already found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> You might beneficially ask yourself: ‘Am I really alert to locate persons who show interest in Jehovah’s loving provisions, or do I make return visits only on people who accept literature?’ The ones we are looking for are those who sincerely have a love of righteousness, those sighing and crying due to the bad conditions in the world, those searching for the truth. That a person does not take literature, due to personal or religious reasons, does not necessarily mean that he has no interest in the truth and that a warm response; to God’s loving provisions cannot be cultivated. (Luke 19:3-5) But how can we go about this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Occasional calls may be very helpful in getting to know certain I ones in our territory so that we I get to know them on a friendly I basis, thus opening the way for more serious and regular discussions of the truth. We have to remember that people have reason to be fearful of strangers, so it may be necessary patiently to cultivate both their interest and their confidence. This takes time and continued effort on our part. Sometimes our objective can be accomplished by taking issues of the magazines to them from time to time when there is something , that we feel may be of particular |</span></p></li></ul>

Millions of handbills are being printed for special house-to-house distribution. Publishers living in interest to them. When there is opportunity, take advantage of the few minutes you may be afforded to talk to them about the truth. Be prepared to discuss a scripture or an article in the current magazine. You may never have a better ' opportunity to witness to that person, so do not be in too much of a hurry to leave for the next call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When a person does permit us to take time for a good discussion, a variety of approaches may be helpful. Some brothers like to let the householder do much of the talking the first time to find out what is on his mind and what is of interest to him. Just because he brings up wrong ideas, we do not have to refute them at the outset. Remember, our message is the good news of the Kingdom, and this is what we should emphasize. Other matters can be cleared up in time. Our goal is to win hearts, not arguments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Remember, too, that these are not “our sheep,” but God’s. Often another publisher may be more effective with certain ones than we are, so why not invite that person along on the call?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Do not get discouraged when you make a return visit on someone only to have your offer of a home Bible study refused. Even if the call is not as productive as we might like to see it, perhaps it was enough to start the person thinking and reading so that more progress may be made on future calls. We know, of course, that, after we have done all that we can, it is God who makes the interest grow, and we pray for this. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) However, our work of planting and cultivating includes weeding out those showing no interest, and our return visits will help us to do that.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">the assembly cities and nearby will be invited to share. If you plan to travel from out-of-town to an assembly, could you arrange to arrive a day or two early to share in this work? If so, request your rooming accommodations accordingly. And, on arrival at the assembly city, go to the address of the rooming department for territory and handbill supplies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ During January and February, 218,-030 new subscriptions were received from the U.S.A, by the office here in Brooklyn; that is up </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">26</span><span class="font5"> percent over the same months last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Other lands report fine success with magazines: With the Chinese New Year holidays the publishers in Hong Kong averaged 65.1 magazines, and regular pioneers 330.8. Germany obtained 7,315 subscriptions, largest number since January 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Philippines reports attendance of 121,-121 at ten “Divine Victory&quot; assemblies, with 4,368 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Baptisms in many lands continue at a higher rate than last year: Argentina has 211 more baptized than for all last year. Nigeria reports 11,010 baptized —more than the total for all the 1973 service year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Many new publisher peaks were reached in January: Jamaica, with 6,167 publishers, had a 23-percent increase. Nicaragua had 2,441, a 22-percent increase over last year’s average. Police opposition in San Marino has stopped and brothers report 38 publishers for the first time. South Africa passed the 25,000 mark for the first time with 25,412. Australia had a 19-percent increase, with 27,943 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">« Is there a way to reach prison inmates to witness to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many requests come to the Society each week from prison inmates asking for literature and requesting that someone conduct a Bible study with them. To help such persons, the Society writes the local congregation and asks that the interested person be contacted in the prison. It would be appreciated if prompt attention would be given to these calls. Literature can, in some cases, be given directly to the prisoner by those calling, but in some prisons it is required that the literature be sent directly from the publishing house. Where the prisoner cannot afford a contribution, the congregation or the individual publisher may provide the contribution to cover the cost and ask the Society to send the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In some localities it has been possible, after discussing our Bible educational program with the prison officials or with government officials who have jurisdiction over prison matters, to obtain a permit that will actually allow one to go from cell to cell in the prison to talk with the inmates, leaving literature where possible. Older magazines may be left free with the inmates, if the prison officials permit, and then, as interest is developed, books or subscriptions may be placed and Bible studies started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If there is a prison in your territory, it is recommended that the congregation arrange for an elder to visit the prison officials to find out what may be, required to contact the prisoners and to provide Bible literature for them to read and, if at all possible, to conduct Bible studies with them on either a group or an individual basis.</span></p>

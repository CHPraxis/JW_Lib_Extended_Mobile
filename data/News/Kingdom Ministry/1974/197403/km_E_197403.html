<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In rapidly increasing numbers, people are finding the real reason for life. They are learning that when they give of themselves in doing God’s will, there is genuine satisfaction. (Rev. 4:11) As a result, during December thousands more joined with us in the field ministry. In fact, the 525,007 who reported included 103,112 more than had shared just one year earlier here in the U.S. What a thrill to see such a marvelous increase in the number of praisers of Jehovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Putting forth more than the usual effort, we all had a part in distributing the 46,018,935 copies of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 17 that were put into the hands of the public. During the month, the number of regular pioneers moved up to a new peak, and 15,734 others put forth special effort as temporary pioneers. All together, the report showed that over 3,600,000 more hours were devoted to preaching the good news than for the same month a year ago. What a grand witness was given!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Now we need to take practical steps to keep on in this right course, despite the problems and pressures associated with the breakdown of this present system. To do that we need to lean heavily on Jehovah for his spirit. How do we get more of this invisible force that gives proper direction to our actions and speech?—Eph. 5:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> If we build our lives around spiritual things, such as prayer, personal study and meditation, we are headed in the right direction. If we cultivate a desire to be present at the meetings, we are truly pursuing our goal. Further, if we develop a desire to be in association with spiritually minded people, surely this sort of spiritual influence will greatly help us to get a firm hold on the real life. —1 Cor. 2:13; 1 Tim. 6:17-19.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> During March, is it possible for us to lean even more heavily on Jehovah? If we do this, marvelous benefits will flow to us daily. We will be able to harness our thoughts more effectively to spiritual matters. (1 John 5:14; Prov. 15:28) And when we think about the spiritual events taking place in March, our hearts should move us to share in them as fully as possible. For example, we are in the third month of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">campaign and every day we can make, or take advantage of, marvelous opportunities to publicize Jehovah’s name. In addition to regular house-to-house calls and return visits, have you tried obtaining subscriptions through informal witnessing? You may be pleasantly surprised at your success in this field of witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Study on our part helps us to develop an even more prayerful i attitude and a finer relationship with Jehovah. As we increase our knowledge and feel even closer to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, unquestionably this will be a powerful aid in overcoming any obstacles we might experience in connection with our worship and in living our lives even as Jesus lived his life.—Mark 9:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Moreover, as the upbuilding information that we constantly receive sinks deeply into our hearts, surely we will be motivated to share as fully as possible in the field ministry.—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Undoubtedly one of the high points during March will be the special public talk on March 31, “Surviving on the Victorious Side at Har-Magedon.” Surely this will be a rewarding occasion for all of us. May Jehovah bless us as w’e continue to get a firm hold on the real life and aid others to do the same.</span></p>

As close as you do to a very dear relative or friend? even closer? We should strive to develop our relationship with our God by drawing closer to him each day. If Jehovah is real to us, then even though we may be in dire straits we can maintain integrity by fully relying on him.—Ps 86:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah is real to those who base their faith on accurate knowledge. (Heb. 11:1, 2, 6; Rom. 1:20; John 4:24) Jehovah is real to those who know his qualities. Review page 266 of “Make Sure.” We draw close to Jehovah when we imitate his qualities. (Eph. 4:32-5:1) This requires a knowledge of His Word. (John 17:3; Prov. 2:1-6; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Jehovah is real to those w’ho experience his dealings with them. (Heb. 11:17-38) Regular communication with Jehovah through prayer will draw us closer to him as we thoughtfully observe the way he answers our prayers and blesses our efforts in his service. (Ps. 65:2; Phil. 4:6, 7) We. will be blessed as we cultivate the habit of relying fully on Jehovah. (Phil. 4:13) Then, as we work with him in his service, we can meditate on his goodness manifest in so many ways. (1 Thess. 5:17, 18; Eph. 5:20; 1 Pet. 4:7) By our obeying his commands and by daily meditating on his ways, Jehovah will be real to us. (Ps. 37:30, 31; 1:1-3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">25 min: Identifying the Modern “Faithful and Discreet Slave” Class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If we are to prove ourselves loyal to Jehovah and his organization in spite of increasing pressures and obstacles to our worship, necessary to cooperate with and serve under direction of “faithful and discreet slave,” to whom ‘all the Master’s belongings’ have been entrusted.

Make sure following points are covered: (1) Noteworthy that Matthew 24:46 shows “slave” found providing food upon Master’s return. Explain. (ka pp. 342-347) (2) Historical evidence clear that at time of Christ’s second coming, in 1914, only one organization -was feeding people spiritual food “at the proper time” and had its “identifying marks.” (w62, pp. 760, 761) (3) Scriptural credentials of “slave” strong. (w60, pp. 437, 438) (4) “Slave” not one person, but all the members of spirit-begotten ones on earth as class at any given time, (ka pp. 340, 341; li p. 183) “Slave” class provides food for individual members of anointed, the “domestics.” (li pp. 183-185) (5) Slave now enjoys new position; appointed over all Christ’s earthly belongings (Matt. 24:47), all the spiritual things that belong to him here on earth in connection with his established heavenly kingdom, (ka pp.. 353-357) (6) As in first century, certain members of slave class selected to be governing body, which, directed by holy spirit, makes appointments of overseers and ministerial servants. (Acts 14:23; w71, pp. 755-762)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Get observations of audience on following points: How can we show we are deeply convinced that this is Jehovah’s organization and that no man, but Christ Jesus, is the appointed Head of it? How can we daily work with “slave” class, Christ’s “brothers,” yet on earth, loyally and willingly sharing in giving final witness? In w<sup>T</sup>hat tvays do we see need of Jehovah’s organization and wisdom of cooperating with it and its appointed elders and ministerial servants?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Human imperfections and faults we all have. Working as closely as we do in the Christian congregation, there are occasions when problems come up and perhaps even get magnified out of proportion. But as we all know, one of the hallmarks of Christianity is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">agape</span><span class="font12"> or principled love. What can we do individually and collectively to perfect this most important quality in our lives? Obviously we all want to make a contribution to the unity and harmony of the Christian congregation with which we serve. In this connection it may be helpful to review some of the circumstances with which some are confronted from time to time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For example, you may be a sister who has been upset because an elder has counseled your son due to his conduct at the Kingdom Hall. Perhaps you feel inclined to find fault with his counsel or to reply with angry words against the brother. But would it not be good to remember that love “does not become provoked” and that “love is long-suffering and kind”? If we appreciate that our older brothers are interested in us and in our families and have no reason unduly to inject themselves into our family affairs, is it not possible for us to accept counsel in the spirit in which it is given? (Prov. 15:31; Ps. 141:5) It is true, of course, that the elders usually call these things to the attention of parents first, making recommendations to the parents and letting them handle the matter. However, if such things persist, such as misbehaving at the Kingdom Hall, then elders may choose to reason with both parents and child, giving appropriate counsel and help. We do have to maintain a certain decorum at the</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font12">others, but rejoices in seeing </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> fellowman receive a position of greater responsibility. Is it not better to view this brother from his spiritual qualifications, overlooking his human imperfections and cooperating with him? (Heb. 13:7, 17) Obviously, the loving thing would be not to listen with a critical ear, but to profit from the counsel and instruction he gives, since what is really important is what comes from God’s Word, not who says it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Finally, elders themselves need to be discreet, recognizing that of the one to whom much has been given, more is demanded. (Luke 12:48) Surely it would be inappropriate for elders to engage in vulgar speech or to present an image of accomplishing things in their own might, perhaps even bragging of their accomplishments, for love “does not behave indecently” and love “does not brag, does not get puffed up.” In giving counsel, in delivering talks, in shepherding and in teaching, yes, in all things, it is the responsibility of elders to set a loving, humble example, recognizing that they too have things to learn and that others also have good ideas. How important it is for all of us daily to demonstrate intense love toward one another. —Jer. 9:24; 1 Cor. 1:31; 13:4-7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> You may be one who feels that an elder should be a better speaker or a better organizer. Additionally, he may have little mannerisms that disturb you. Frankly, you may wonder about his qualifications. Perhaps you do not enjoy his talks from the platform and secretly resent his counsel to the congregation. In a situation like this, would it not be good to reflect on the fact that “love is not jealous” and that it “bears all things”? Perhaps you are assessing this brother from your own viewpoint or from a human standard; whereas, the qualifications for elders and ministerial servants are set forth in God’s Word. Moreover, love is not envious of good things coming to</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Truly there are compelling reasons to obey Jesus’ command to celebrate the Memorial. Appreciating this in times past, our brothers have assembled, even under the most trying circumstances. One example of this can be seen in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1974 Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> pages 143-145. Why have our brothers in Germany and throughout the earth shown such great appreciation for this event? It is not only because we are commanded to keep this occasion, but also because of the spiritual benefits to ourselves and those who join with us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The Memorial is a time for sober reflection on our own course as a Ghristian. It is a time to meditate on what we have done and what we are going to do with</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font12">our lives in the future. It is a time to intensify our determination to do Jehovah’s will no matter what may come. Above all, it is a time to consider deeply the love of Jehovah in providing the ransom, as well as the love of Jesus, who willingly paid the ransom price so we might have hope. (John 15:13; Phil. 2:7, 8) How encouraging, how motivating it is to reflect on this marvelous provision!—1 John 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Good planning, both individually and congregationally, will contribute toward all present getting the most benefit from the Memorial this year.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Informally</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many now faithfully serving Jehovah first learned of his purposes through informal witnessing. You may know of persons who have successfully aided family members into the truth. Others have thoughtfully spoken to friends, business acquaintances, fellow workers, teachers, schoolmates, visitors, neighbors, fellow travelers, and so on, thereby planting seeds of truth that took root in fine soil.—Luke 8:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A major advantage of informal witnessing is the congenial, relaxed atmosphere in which it can be done. Much can be accomplished during a friendly discussion under favorable circumstances. In fact, it is possible in this way to reach persons who may never have heard the good news at their doors. Even a brief contact, such as that made on a bus, a train, an airplane, or in a waiting room, may stimulate a person’s interest to the point where the next Witness who calls will get a hearing ear.—Prov. 15:7; Eccl. 11: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some find it best when witnessing informally to make brief statements that will arouse a person’s curiosity and that may cause the person to ask questions about our message and work. Or, we may ask questions to stimulate a person’s thinking, and then show the Bible’s answer. As always, there is a need to be discreet and tactful.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Ready for Memorial </span><span class="font12">(Conn’d) tions for additional attendants, chairs, the emblems, proper ventilation and appropriate announcements. Since the Memorial will be the only meeting that day, you may want to have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study at another time during the week. (Of course, all Memorial celebrations should begin after 7:00 p.m., daylight saving time.) Arrangements can be made for field service that Sunday, with special emphasis on inviting and bringing interested persons to the Memorial. With a special effort on the part of everyone we should have a fine attendance indeed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses as a group are truly the happiest, most friendly people on earth. Yet on this We should avoid wasting time with those not sincerely interested.—Matt. 7:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We can casually mention to workmates or persons we meet every day what we have learned at meetings, at assemblies, in personal study, and so forth. Over a period of time these seeds of truth may take root and grow, even if the person is indifferent at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When witnessing informally to persons we have never met before, some find it helpful to engage in casual conversation with the individual for a few minutes, initially, to establish a rapport, or friendly spirit of communication. This can then be used as a “platform” from which to build a friendly discussion of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> To be successful it is good to plan ahead for your informal witnessing by having with you one or more small books, such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font12">or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security,</span><span class="font12"> also magazines or booklets. In that way you have something to leave with the person to read, now that you have stimulated his interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> As world conditions worsen, producing more and more anxiety among mankind, we have great joy in comforting those who are “sighing and groaning.” (Ezek. 9:4) Too, as we get closer to the “great tribulation,” informal witnessing may become one of the main preaching methods at our disposal. Why not develop ability in this work now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">special occasion it is well to plan in advance so that new ones in attendance feel so welcome that they will want to attend our meetings </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">regularly.</span><span class="font12"> All of us can give more than the usual attention to welcoming newcomers, since some could easily be overlooked when so many are present. Why not plan to greet as many new ones as possible, engaging them in friendly conversation? If no one is studying with them, perhaps a study could be arranged. Such kindness may be instrumental in aiding more to make fine spiritual progress in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> May Jehovah’s rich blessings be upon our efforts individually and congregationally to get ready for the Memorial.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question $ox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">• What publications should one read before baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 18 of the “Organization” book states that one contemplating baptism will be greatly aided by personally reading the recent publications of the Society in addition to the book he is currently studying. Please observe that no publications are named. It is left up to the local elders to recommend what they believe will be of most help to the individual. Some, in addition to studying the “Truth” book, would be benefited most by absorbing the principles of Christian living set out in the “Peace and Security” book. A person who has been plagued with doubts about the authenticity of the Bible would be benefited by the “Word of God” book. In some cases the elders might recommend the ‘Impossible to Lie’ or the “Life Everlasting” book. It is not a matter of setting out as required reading so many books, but of helping individuals to grow spiritually. That is why this same page in the “Organization” book says: “The elders of the congregation with which you are associated will gladly make recommendations to you of material that will be most helpful.”</span></p>

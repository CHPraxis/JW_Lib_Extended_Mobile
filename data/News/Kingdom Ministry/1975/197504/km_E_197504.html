</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>kingdom ^PuMiske/ts:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Knorr along with Brother F. W. Franz returned safe and sound and gave us a fine report on their round-the-world zone trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Leaving Europe (we already told you about that part of the trip), they flew to Lebanon, where they met with only the elders, due to the ban on our work there. Witnessing is also difficult in Pakistan, the next stop. So imagine their joy when, with only 150 publishers in the whole country, 197 attended the Karachi assembly! In Bombay, India, a new assembly hall atop the branch home holds 400. But 948 showed up to pack out all corners of the home!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Rangoon, Burma, riots in connection with the burial of U Thant resulted in cancellation of the hall for the assembly. But other arrangements were quickly made, and everyone rejoiced to see a peak attendance of 650. In Bangkok, Thailand, it was learned that, out of the country’s 605 publishers, 100 were baptized this past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our traveling brothers then talked to 226 in Penang, Malaysia, to 431 at three separate meetings (in spite of the ban) in Singapore, to 2,175 at Djakarta, Indonesia, and to 1,736 in Sydney, Australia. At this latter gathering the talks were put on videotapes and later shown in Kingdom Halls across the country. In the Town Hall in Auckland, New Zealand, there were 2,866 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the stop in Tahiti it was arranged for a new branch of the Society to be located there for that part of the Pacific. And from there it was on to assemblies in Hawaii, Los Angeles and Denver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Total attendance to hear our traveling brothers was 167,496.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These wonderful reports from around the world only heighten our excitement here at Bethel as we contemplate the activity of the future—in March, the Memorial and special talk; in April, the special magazines; in May, the distribution of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach with Endurance and Joy</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus was on earth he wanted his followers to share with him in telling others the good news. Thus Luke 10:1 says: “The Lord designated seventy . . . and sent them forth by twos in advance of him into every city and place to which he himself was going to come.” In verse 17 we learn one result of this preaching tour: “Then the seventy returned with joy.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Each one of us has had the pleasure of experiencing that same reward. There is true happiness in ‘declaring good news to the poor, preaching a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, sending the crushed ones away with a release and preaching Jehovah’s acceptable year.’ (Luke 4:18, 19) Especially is this true in these days when so many thousands are listening and responding to what Jehovah has said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> However, the Bible does not promise the Christian that joy free of problems. No, a variety of difficulties is what we should expect, with happiness resulting if we endure. So, we have cultivated the thinking of the apostle Paul, who said: “When being reviled, we bless; when being persecuted, we bear up; when being defamed, we entreat.” (1 Cor. 4:12, 13) Other apostles also demonstrated the right view when they “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus’] name.” —Acts 5:41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But perhaps direct persecution is not the problem you face now. Still, do you get opposition from members of your own family? (Matt. 10:21, 35, 36) Jehovah is pleased when we set for them a fine example in Christian conduct, and regular association with your larger ‘family’ in the truth will 20; and then on to the grand series of summer district assemblies!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">help you to succeed in this. (Mark 10:29, 30) If your relatives refuse to listen, you can always devote your preaching time to those in the territory who will listen. Jehovah can fill your life with a useful, productive service in many ways you never imagined.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do you have health problems? Have the years slowed you down? If so, be realistic. What youth accomplishes in one way, you might accomplish through other means. The qualities and gifts your years of experience have developed might accomplish much in a field not open to others. Do you witness by letter, telephone, or informally? Do you study so as to participate in meetings, to answer others’ questions, and to build someone up with a word at the right time? If nothing else, do you support by your presence at meetings, by your smiles, by your prayers, those who can serve more actively than you? There are many ways for you to serve with endurance and joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> April is the last month of this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign. Do you have plans for following up all subscription prospects you have located in the previous three months? It would be good for each family to talk this over and to schedule the needed time so that all such calls, including any involving expired magazine subscriptions, can be made before the month ends. The Bible study overseer can help by being certain that all expiration slips have been distributed to the publishers. Have those with whom you have conducted home Bible studies received their three free copies of the April 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Has your congregation scheduled the two special talks, “Why Look to God as Your Refuge?” and “Are You </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Really</span><span class="font11"> Making Jehovah Your Stronghold?” for late in April or early in May? Be sure you are acquainted with the dates they will be given in your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

Adjust this according to young ones available. Ask questions according to what will be most beneficial for congregation and agreeable with parents. Parents can, at home, review with their children questions assigned them ahead of time by chairman. Thereafter, careful advance rehearsal by chairman would be appropriate. He should be sure to hear, by advance rehearsal, what young ones nave in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(15 min.) (1) Studying for and attending school classes: What are some of the problems youths face today in attending school? What are some things you believe might be done to assist young people with these problems? What have you been doing or what do you plan to do in overcoming or solving these problems? How has the truth helped in these situations?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(2) Field service and meetings: What are some of the obstacles young people have in sharing fully in field service and meetings? What kind of help from congregation do you especially appreciate? What are your goals or plans for making improvement in field service and meeting attendance or participation? Why do some young persons have difficulty sitting quietly through an entire meeting? Why do you think some miss meetings, and what could be done to help them? What do you feel is improper or disturbing conduct in the Kingdom Hall, and how can those engaging in such be helped to improve?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(3) Association and recreation: What are some problems that young people in the truth encounter in filling their need for good association and recreation? What do you especially appreciate about your opportunities for association and recreation with those in the truth ? What do you think you and others can do to help all of you benefit even more from time spent in association with others and in recreation?</span></p></li></ul>

Show what part young ones can have in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> distribution. Distributing them under appropriate parental supervision is something they can enthusiastically share in. Older publishers want their help in getting this important work done well and on time!

Can read excerpts and pose occasional questions for audience. Though can’t cover every point, tell the story. Emphasize that ’no weapon formed against Jehovah’s people will succeed,’ so should not fear persecution. (Isa. 54:17) On pages cited, highlight the following: (1) Courageously, God's people waged a counteroffensive against clergy-inspired opposition by distributing the first issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font10"> (Pp. 97, 98) (2) Severe persecution was endured by Bible Students, and they were “cautious as serpents” (Matt. 10:16) when </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery</span><span class="font10"> and certain other Christian publications were banned.

Show nature of court trial and its outcome, citing fulfillment of Revelation 11:3-7, 10. (Pp. 103-109) (4) Bible Students were optimistic despite ‘Babylonish captivity,’ continuing to witness and meet. Imprisoned brothers also held meetings and preached, with good results. (Pp. 109-112) (5) At annual meeting in 1919, confidence was expressed by reelecting Brother Rutherford president. (Pp. 113-115) (6) . An outstanding witness resulted from work with the petition to release these imprisoned brothers. Released March 26, 1919, and completely exonerated later. (Pp. 115-119) (7) Emphasize that in 1918 and 1919, with God’s aid, Jehovah’s people endured great hardships and ‘no weapon formed against them prospered.’ (P. 119) Similarly, we can be confident that Jehovah will help His people to endure persecution today.</span></p>

[Allow for comment.] The Bible itself indicates that it does. For example, Psalm 83:18 helps us to appreciate what it means to have His name sanctified, treated as holy, or cleared of reproach. [Read.] Yes, people everywhere will someday soon know that Jehovah is the Most High over all. This fact is especially made clear in the Bible book of Ezekiel, which is fully discussed in this book, ‘ “The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah” —How?’ We leave it for 50 cents.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God loves children. They play a part in His grand gurpose, and throughout man’s istory they have brought joy and fulfillment to the family arrangement. (Ps. 68:5; 127:3-5; 128:3-6) In imitation of his Father, Christ Jesus, too, had tender affection for young people. On one occasion when using a youngster as an example, “he put his arms around” the child. He did not view such show of kindness as unmanly. Later, Jesus found time to take some children into his arms and bless them. He enjoyed them, and helping them was a part of his ministry.—Mark 9:36; 10:13-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Having the same view as Jehovah God and his Son, how pleased we are to have children as part of the congregation. We want to see them grow up with a love for Jehovah and righteousness. The congregation is interested in seeing young ones progress in the truth so that their ‘advancement is manifest to all persons.’ (1 Tim. 4:15) How happy a congregation is when such ones grow up to serve in various fields of full-time service such as at Bethel, in pioneer and missionary work, or in other ways set fine examples for the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Of course, parents have the primary responsibility to help their children to be pleasing to Jehovah. Keeping in mind that their chil</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Initiative and foresight are required if parents are to watch out for the spiritual interests of their children. For example, parents who appreciate this, knowing that their children need association, do more than merely warn them against the results of bad association. They themselves set aside time to be with their children, and then they plan for association with children who also love Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Raising children today is not easy. So, parents are usually pleased when the congregation as a whole takes a genuine interest in the young folks. They appreciate any help given. Even a word of acknowledgment that it takes time and effort to bring children to meetings and take them along in the field service is encouraging. So, too, is it encouraging to children when elders take a moment to talk to them and let them know how happy the congregation is to have them attend. Where effort and progress have been made, this can be mentioned. It may involve</span></p></li></ul>

We are all interested in doing what we can to help youths to mature and shoulder their responsibility in Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">While weather was difficult to cope with in various parts of the country, and there was the added problem of sickness, it was a pleasure to see 524,492 proclaimers of the Kingdom message out in January. This represents a 7.1-percent increase over January of last year. We obtained 122,536 new subscriptions and placed 624,130 books. What a joy to see so many accepting our Bible study aids, openiiig additional opportunities for us to make return visits and start Bible studies!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using Questions to Arouse Interest</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Great Teacher, Jesus, used questions to arouse interest and to make people think. (Matt. 17:25; 18:12; Mark 11:29, 30) Reading of such effective use of questions makes us want to copy Jesus’ use of them in our field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When placing single copies of the magazines, many find it very practical to pose a question about one of the articles. Having captured the interest of the individual, then you can go on to call attention to the article and present the magazines. But be prepared to follow through on whatever subject you raised by your question, either with a further comment on the matter, or by pointing out a spe-, cific point in the article being presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Some brothers, too, have had success using the following question, or a variation of it, and you may find it helpful to you. After briefly introducing themselves, they ask, “If you had the power to overcome just one of the problems in the world, which one would it be?” Then, after getting the answer, they refer to a scripture that deals with it. For instance, if the answer is, “I would do away with the corrupt governments,” the householder is directed to Daniel 2:44 to show that arrangements have already been made by God to set up a kingdom that will do away with corrupt governments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Know Jehovah </span><span class="font11">book, we might say: “In the Bible book of Ezekiel there is an impor</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Preach with Endurance and Joy </span><span class="font11">(Co/it’d) congregation so you can invite interested ones to be there with you. These talks contain information that will surely help those who attended the Memorial and the special talk on March 30. Invite them to be there on these two occasions also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Has your secular employment been affected by the economic slowdown? We hear that some brothers have decided to temporary pioneer, now that they are employed fewer hours. The elders will gladly give immediate attention to your application if you find that you can share in this tant statement that is repeated 62 times for emphasis and that has meaning for today. Would you like to know what that statement is?” (Pause for reply.) Then, read the title of the book. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">kj,</span><span class="font11"> page 32.) Even when offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription, you may find it effective to ask questions on an appropriate article to arouse interest; or you may wish to use a question that can be answered by the scripture that appears prominently in the first article of each issue during the campaign.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A word of caution, though, in regard to using questions: They should not be used to embarrass people. You may want to suggest possible answers to your question. Or, if your householder hesitates to reply, you may just continue to talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> At first you may find it difficult to use questions, but continue trying. Even if at first you are not successful, you will find that in time you become experienced and effective in their use. They are often helpful to get a conversation going and to draw the householder out so that you know his viewpoint better, and are able to build on what interests him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> You may find it very helpful to discuss with others in the congregation the use of questions to arouse interest. If you find something that is particularly helpful to you, then pass it on to others so that they too will benefit. The effective use of questions can improve the quality of your field service and stimulate interesting discussions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">privilege for a month or so. Loss of employment usually causes hardships, but sharing more fully in field service can bring much joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> April should be a month of great activity for Jehovah’s people. There is much work that needs to be done. Young and old, new and seasoned publishers, should share unreservedly. Preaching and teaching should occupy a large part of our time and attention these days. What a privilege to share in this work! Jehovah will richly bless all those who put forth the effort to preach with endurance and joy no matter what the conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are now 18 Jehovah's Witnesses Assembly Halls in use for circuit assemblies in this country, with one more under construction. The average seating capacity for each auditorium is about 1,500, although for a few it is above 2,000. Most have areas that can be used for overflow, and these increase total seating capacity considerably. Some have separate cafeterias and Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">0 A year ago Hong Kong had 307 publishers, but this January a new peak of 423 reported there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers in India (4,494 publishers) enjoyed 11 district assemblies with a total attendance of 6,363, and 235 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;■ Ten years ago France had about 21,750 publishers. Now, with their latest peak, they have reached 61,029. Brothers are rejoicing to be able to offer “The Watchtower” since the ban on it has been lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;? Mexico, since 1968, has about doubled the number of its publishers, with 73,916 now reporting field service. Baptisms are running 1,593 ahead of last year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">• Are new attenders at our meetings welcome to comment even though their lives are not in harmony with Bible principles ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When people show an interest in the truth, we are happy to invite them to our meetings, knowing they will benefit in many ways. Some, by attending just one meeting, through listening and observation, have become convinced that ‘God is with us.’ We do not inquire into their personal lives before extending such invitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nor do we need to make such inquiry before allowing them to comment. Participation is a part of our educational arrangement, so if a new person raised his hand, we would not refuse to acknowledge it. He would no doubt benefit by sharing, and his participation would probably also encourage others. —Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What of those </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">newly associated</span><span class="font10"> who are tobacco users or who have some immorality in their background? Well, would not the above reasoning still apply as long as they conducted themselves in a decorous and respectable manner? Commenting does not make them members of the congregation. They are newcomers and learning. Very likely, as have others in the past, they will make improvement, clean up their lives and make progress toward dedication and baptism. We cannot expect that when they first begin attending they will be completely free of all wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The elders, however, and especially the one conducting, must be alert to watch for any notorious persons who might try to sneak into the congregation to do harm, even as Jude warned. So, in general, nonbaptized, newly interested ones may be called upon to comment, if raising the hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1975 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will say to Jehovah: 'You are my refuge and my stronghold.’”—Ps. 91:2. VOL XVIII NO. 10</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Kingdom</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">Here is something new! Something to aid you in making more return visits, and starting more home Bible studies. How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Well, the Society is planning to print three new booklets for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign. Each one has been written in a simple manner especially for the public. These three booklets will be offered as a premium with a year’s subscription. Each publisher obtaining a new subscription will want to make a return visit and endeavor to start a home Bible study in the booklet that appeals most to the individual with whom he left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The titles of these new 32-page booklets are (1) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A Secure Future—How You Can Find It, </span><span class="font12">(2) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">There Is Much More to Life! </span><span class="font12">and (3) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a. God Who Cares?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, you will want to know what they are about, so the public talks to be given on December 14, December 21 and December 28 will be based on these booklets. Each speaker will be given a copy of the booklet that he is to use and he can prepare the talk covering the points in the booklet assigned to him. The publishers can obtain their copy of each particular booklet after the talk is given and can review the questions on the paragraphs so as to be ready for the January campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now, suppose a person does not subscribe for the magazines for a whole year and get the premium offer. What then? The publisher will drop down to two magazines and these three new booklets and offer them on a contribution of 25 cents. The booklet that the publisher thinks will appeal most to the householder should be on top and he should use that booklet as a talking point. If the person does not want this offer, then present just one booklet for 5 cents. The publisher should then return the following week and talk over that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovahs Day Is Near*</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Peter emphasized the certainty of the coming of Jehovah’s “day.” Regardless of when it would actually arrive, it was something to be reckoned with. For that reason he said: “What sort of persons ought you to be . . . awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” (2 Pet. 3:11, 12) Today we are living some 1,900 years later, which means that Jehovah’s day is that much closer. We must keep wide awake spiritually, appreciating that Jehovah’s day is now immediately ahead.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Since we are interested in the lives of people, it is important that we urgently warn all whom we can, awakening them to the imminent presence of Jehovah’s day. What a fine aid the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine is for doing this excellent work. For 56 years now, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> has been used to carry a lifesaving message to the people to alert them to the times in which we live. Every two weeks more than nine million copies in 31 languages currently are put into the hands of the people world wide. It will be a pleasure to feature </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> again during October. Since most people identify </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> as a companion to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> why not offer both subscriptions, with six booklets, for $3.00?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Much good is also accomplished by the distribution of individual copies of the magazines. During October we have outstanding issues of both magazines to use. The special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> of October 8 will be titled “A Sound Guide for Modem Living,” and the October 22 issue will also be most interesting on the subject “Does It All End Here?” The October 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will feature the subject of the public talk given at the recent district assemblies, “One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty.” It will accomplish much good if we put forth an extra effort to get these into the hands of many people. Will you have a share?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Then, during November, we will enjoy the special distribution of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 21, presenting the subject “Your Future —Shaky? or Secure?” It emphasizes the fact that neither politics nor science, but only God’s kingdom will bring us a secure future and deliverance through the coming day of Jehovah. So as Peter said, “What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion!” Our zealous activity in distributing these tracts from November 1 to 10 will be one way to show that we are indeed “keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.”—2 Pet. 3:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Following the distribution of the tracts, we will be privileged to offer in the field for the first time the latest book, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand!,</span><span class="font12"> along with a booklet, for 50c. Among the interesting facts found in this publication are comments about “Jehovah’s day.” This is a special period of time when Jehovah actively moves against his enemies and on behalf of his people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">. <sup>6</sup> Thus in many ways and by use of various publications Jehovah’s organization is endeavoring to alert the people to the nearness of Jehovah’s day and to help them to appreciate the good news of God’s kingdom. But usually personal attention and instruction are necessary. That is one reason why the booklets are offered with the subscription and also the larger books. Be sure to include with both offers a booklet, such as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font12"> booklet or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom,” </span><span class="font12">which are good for starting a home Bible study. Using one of these for study, in just a few weeks </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

(Heb. 5:11-6:1) New ones attracted to the congregation by the things they learn, appreciating spiritual truths instead of tradition and ritual. How can we help them continue progressing toward maturity? Association in addition to the meetings is especially encouraging. Do you know someone you could help this way? Many need continued help in study even after baptism. May wish to invite new ones to share in your family study at times. Are there some in your book study who would be happy to share in field service with you? Help may also be appreciated preparing a field presentation or a part for the School. We want to offer such spiritual, assistance, thus showing we feel the same way toward our spiritual brothers as Jesus did.—Matt. 12:50.</span></p>

Do not want to see any of our spiritual family neglected. [Demonstration] Two sisters talking about elderly sister, not getting to meetings, apartment not kept up properly; w'hy don’t elders do something for her? One comments, “Of course, she is our sister in the truth too; maybe we should do something ourselves.” Agree this is a good idea. Plan to take turns picking her up for meetings, seeing what they can do in a tactful way to help her clean her apartment since she is getting feeble. [Ask congregation.] What kinds of things can sisters do to help others in the congregation in a practical way? What can teen-agers do? What can elders do to help others in the congregation? All of us can show love by warmly welcoming all attending meetings. How can love be shown in other practical ways in harmony with John 13:35?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Concluding comments. Accounts report.

Emphasize that Jehovah alw’ays provides the spiritual food and direction Christians need and prospers their disciple-making work. (1) How have Jehovah’s people shown that they advocate God’s kingdom, not any other form of government? (Pp. 234-237) (2) During the early 1960’s, how did Jehovah give Christians timely direction regarding their relationship to secular governmental authorities? (Pp. 237, 238) (3) As to disciple-making, what publication and Bible study program were introduced in 1968? (Pp. 239, 240) (4) Why has it been necessary to expand the Watch Tow’er Society’s printing facilities, and to W’hom must the credit go for theocratic prosperity? (P. 245) (5) In keeping w’ith divine direction, what adjustments in congregation structure w’ere made among God’s people in 1971 and 1972? What are some benefits of the new’ arrangement?

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THEOCRATIC SCHOOL</span></h2>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INSTRUCTIONS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">During 1976 the School schedule should be conducted in all congregations as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> [w] and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> [g], and the books </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font11"> [ad] and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> [te] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">INSTRUCTION TALK: No. 1: 15 minutes. This should not be just a summary of the assigned material. It should be a well-developed talk on a chosen theme, assigned to an elder if possible, or, when necessary, to a qualified ministerial servant. The coverage should not be superficial but should provide a presentation that is truly informative and helpful to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ORAL REVIEW: 5 minutes. This will immediately follow the No. 1 talk, and will be conducted by the same •brother who gave the talk. The review will be conducted, not the following week, but on the same night that the talk is given. The questions asked should help the audience to see clearly the main points covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 2: 6 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material. The reading assignments are short enough to permit the student to present explanatory information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at fitting intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, application of principles and expressions of appreciation for the wisdom reflected in the text may be included. The talk should be planned in a way that allows for all the assigned verses actually to be read. The allotted time should be fully utilized. The material may be presented as a talk to the congregation, or a boy may read it to his father or to another qualified older brother seated on the platform. The father or other older brother may then use questions to draw from the boy comments on the value of the material or he may offer suggestions with a view to helping him to improve his reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALKS NOS. 3 AND 4: 6 minutes each. These talks are assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering one of these talks, the student may either be seated or standing. Although using mainly notes and the Bible, the students, when appropriate, may read excerpts or quotations from the assigned material. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, the congregation or elsewhere; at times the presentation may simply be informative conversation between family members or others. The sister giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistants) do so. Not the setting, but the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 5: 6 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience, it should be a talk to the</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SCHEDULE FOR 1976</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the speaker, when fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material especially lends itself to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points in mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip. When a setting is selected, endeavor to choose one that will show practical use of the material assigned, where that is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">COUNSEL: Specific counsel on each student talk will be given, following the program of progressive counsel outlined at the bottom of the Speech Counsel slip. Appreciative comments on important points covered by speakers, whether stated by the counselor or elicited from the audience by means of review questions, can help to keep the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. Be careful to use no more than two minutes for counseling each student talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TIMING: No talk should go overtime; neither should the counsel. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 will be stopped if necessary when the time is up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ad</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">te</span><span class="font11"> and complete the assignment of personal Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this thirty-minute review. The balance of the hour will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper and, in reading off the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, stressing the matter of accurate knowledge and letting the audience turn to the textbooks where the answers may be checked. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of fifty or more students should arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other elders, if possible. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it seems advisable, sisters may take any talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talks Nos. 3 and 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ABSENTEEISM: If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Orderliness, a </span><span class="font14">Fine Quality for All</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Among the fine qualities required of overseers is that of being orderly. However, cultivating this trait is beneficial for all Christians, young and old, brothers and sisters. Being orderly carries the thought of being decorous, disciplined, regular, mannerly, having a well-arranged or well-ordered life. Do you show these qualities? —1 Tim. 3:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In the case of an overseer, he should show that he is orderly ’by following a pattern that others in the congregation can depend on in close adherence to Bible laws and principles, not disorderly. (2 Thess. 3:6, 7) He is self-con-trolled, balanced even when under pressure. While orderliness is not simply to be equated with punctuality or keeping accurate records, yet an overseer who is orderly would discipline himself to care for things properly and on time. (Note comments in 1973 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> page 472.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> An overseer who appreciates this quality will plan the meetings sufficiently in advance so they will be well-conducted, orderly meetings. By so doing he shows consideration for others and helps to avoid parts that are rushed in preparation and poorly developed. —1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When problems arise in the congregation, overseers who are orderly will show respect for God’s Word by not being lax in caring for their responsibilities. They also show courtesy by arranging to consider promptly problems that arise, so that the brothers may be given assistance or counsel, rather than their putting things off indefinitely, thus causing frustration and uncertainty for others.—Prov. 13:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> A father who appreciates orderliness will have things well arranged for his family to get to meetings, and on time, and to share in field service to keep them strong spiritually. If some in the family grow lax in appreciation for theocratic order, he may also have to apply to his own family the suggestion Paul gave at 1 Thessalonians 5:14.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In the home a Christian wife appreciates how<sup>T</sup> important it is to apply Bible principles. She knows how good it is to have everything neat and in good order, so that the home reflects the application of godly principles. (Titus 2:4, 5, 10) She trains her children to keep things picked up and in their place. She can be depended on to keep things clean and orderly and to have meals</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Last year throughout the world 127,135 pioneers, on an average, shared in conveying God’s word to others. While many are not in a position to enjoy the privilege of pioneer service because of Scriptural responsibilities, we can all share in letting the light of truth shine.—2 Cor. 4:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> After paraphrasing Psalm 116: 10 by saying, “I exercised faith, therefore I spoke,” Paul commented, “we' too exercise faith and therefore we speak.” (2 Cor. 4:13) Is that the way you feel? Do you have that same “spirit of faith” that Paul spoke about? If so, have you asked yourself, “Am I in a position to become a regular pioneer?” Or perhaps you would like to try being a temporary pioneer as a first step toward making full-time pioneer service your way of life, joining the 127,135 who received many blessings due to spending pioneer time in the field service last year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some have held back from pioneering, feeling that it is more than they can do or that they are not really qualified for such service. Yet the qualifications are not difficult. (See the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Have you who are pioneers invited other brothers and sisters in your congregation to work with you as you share in this fine service? By doing so you will assist them to extend the hope of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to others. As Paul wrote: “In order that the undeserved kindness which was multiplied should abound because of the thanksgiving of many more to the glory of God.”—2 Cor. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Despite the rising cost of living, shortage of secular work, and the “anxieties of life,” many have found it possible to continue in the pioneer ranks.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Regardless of whether we are pioneers or not, we all want to treasure our privilege of declaring Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to others,' not giving up, but keeping our eyes on the goal of everlasting life.—2 Cor. 4:16-18.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' Despite the many attractions and diversions of summer, including assemblies, vacations, gardening, canning, etc., you nonetheless devoted much time (6,821,870 hours) and energy to preaching and teaching. There were 531,294 reporting field service, over 15,000 more than last July. Likely there were even more who actually shared in proclaiming the good news, as some, when away from home and the usual routine, forget to report their activity or are late getting in their reports. The 8,864,224 magazines that were placed hopefully reached the hands of those who will benefit from the faith-strengthening message therein. May their hearts also be moved to join those telling the good news to others in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You may use the October 8 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> along with Proverbs 3:5, 6, if desired.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">particular booklet’s contents and see if he can get a home Bible study started. In four to six studies he should be through the booklet. If the people wish to discuss another booklet, well and good, but by this time the publisher should know if the person really wants to go ahead with further Bible study. Then one of the pocket-sized books can be selected and used for study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The whole idea is to get more Bible studies going during this coming winter so as to aid people to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. Whether you get a subscription, or just place two magazines and the three booklets, or place one booklet, you have a basis for a return visit with the hope of starting a home Bible study and arousing the interest of the householder in God’s kingdom. Jesus said we should “make disciples of people of all the nations,” and while we still have the opportunity all of us will want to put forth an extraordinary effort to do just that. —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations that have ordered handbills for December 14, 21 and 28 will find the three subjects that correspond with the titles of the booklets substituted for the ones that they listed in their order. This will be true of all public talks on those dates, including the ones given by circuit overseers and at circuit assemblies. As soon as the booklets are printed we will send sample copies to each congregation, and the presiding overseer will see to it that the speakers each get their copy so as to prepare their talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The presiding overseer will also consult with those who handle the movement of literature and those who keep the records of placements and try to determine how many booklets will be needed for at least the first two months of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign, January and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s Day Is Near! </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">you can give the householder a fine insight into Jehovah’s wonderful purposes without feeling a need to offer something else to study first.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah is certainly blessing the efforts of his people with marvelous expansion, and we rejoice to have a share in it. May Jehovah bless our work in the months ahead as we continue to ‘keep close in mind the presence of Jehovah’s day.’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">February, and then order the quantity required along with other literature that may be needed. This order should come to the Society sometime after October 15 and no later than November 15. Our suggestion is that you order at least five booklets of each of the three publications for each publisher, unless you think that you can use more. Take into consideration your pioneers too. At the end of January, or maybe earlier, after observing how the booklets are moving, you can place your second order so that you will have a sufficient quantity to take you through to the end of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These are going to be permanent booklets. So you do not have to order only for the campaign. You may order enough for six months, but do it in two orders. You may have to revise your thinking a little bit as to how well booklets will move, because we have not been stressing booklets. But we will do so now during the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">campaign because we would like to use these new booklets to start Bible studies. That is our big aim in this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations, Please Take Note: All handbills in English that you have ordered for some specific public meeting topic for December 14, 21 or 28 in the United States will automatically be changed by the handbill desk in Brooldyn to the new subjects for these dates. Other handbill orders, which set out just meeting times, will be printed as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are pleased to make this early announcement of this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign with its special emphasis on return visits and Bible studies. We hope that every publisher of the Kingdom will be enthusiastic about this special effort to start more Bible studies. More will be written later, but we want you to order now the quantity of booklets you will need for your congregation. Please do this after October 15 and before November 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another thing we can all do is to pray to Jehovah that he will bless this arrangement and open up the hearts and minds of many to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Be assured of our warm love and best wishes for an excellent </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">9</span><span class="font10"> What action should the congregation take with regard to unbaptized associates who fall into serious wrongdoing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book, page 174, shows that unbaptized wrongdoers who have been regularly associating with the congregation may be disciplined in a way similar to the way baptized wrongdoers are handled. Some have asked, What is meant by “regularly associating” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These are not newly associated persons who are studying and who still have their worldly ways. Rather, the persons referred to as “regularly associating” are those w’ho have made some progress in the way of truth and who nave been attending meetings regularly over a period of time. Usually they have been sharing in field service, are enrolled in the School, and have come to be regarded by others as being Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If such an unbaptized associate falls into serious wrongdoing, the elders should talk to him about what is said in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 128, 129. If after that he is still </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">unrepentant, </span><span class="font10">in spite of repeated efforts of the elders to help him with his problem, then the congregation and its members must be protected from the danger of contamination, in harmony with Paul’s counsel at Galatians 5:9. Announcement should be made that his conduct is “unbecoming a Christian,” and that for anyone to continue associating with him would not be in harmony with the counsel of 1 Corinthians 15:33. He will be denied the privilege of giving student talks, participating in demonstrations from the platform, etc. No field service reports would be accepted from such a person. In the event the elders later are satisfied that this person shows fruits of repentance, it would be proper to announce that the restrictions on him have been lifted. With the elders taking the initiative, the congregation can then continue giving loving aid with the view of helping the repentant one along the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There may be others, not yet “regularly associating,” who are studying and starting to attend meetings, but who are still contaminated with worldly uncleanness. Of course, no action needs to be taken against these, but they should be encouraged to take steps to clean up their lives. Only when they have done this should they be invited to accompany the publishers in the field service, share in presentations from the platform, etc. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 128, 129.) It is our hope that, as they study and apply God’s Word, they will be motivated to make the necessary changes to become acceptable to Jehovah.</span></p>

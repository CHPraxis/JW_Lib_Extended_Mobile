<p><span class="font3">This is the month when the “Divine Sovereignty” District Assemblies begin. Which one will you be attending? There are over ninety in the United States, so one should be near your home. On each day, from Thursday through Sunday, the program will offer down-to-earth discussions to help all of us to conform more fully to Jehovah’s ways, a fascinating Bible drama, and much “solid” spiritual food. Don’t miss any of it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We here at Bethel frequently have spiritual treats. On April 21, following our family study, we enjoyed meeting the students of Gilead’s 59th class. They shared some heartwarming experiences with us. For example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A couple from Hawaii related that one night they had earnestly prayed to “Yahweh” for him to bring them in touch with his people, if such a people existed. Within five minutes a Witness was at their door with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font3"> book. They read it that very night and went to the Kingdom Hall the next day. As the wife said: “It is simply amazing how quickly Jehovah answered our prayer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A student from the Near East told what happened when a brother was called up for national service: “When he explained to an official that his conscience would not permit him to take part, the official pointed his gun at the brother’s head, demanding: ‘To whom do you belong, to Jehovah or your country?’ The brother answered: ‘I belong to Jehovah.’ The official removed the gun, and said: ‘My congratulations. You are a man of integrity’; and he set </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font3">free.” How heartwarming to hear of such examples of faithfulness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Vietnam our brothers have also been undergoing tests. We have heard that all eighteen missionaries got out of the country in ample time as the crest of the war moved toward Saigon. But, of course, over a hundred of our Vietnamese brothers and sisters are still there. Nothing that is not</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Faithfulness—Our Way of Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” (Deut. 32:4) This is how Moses felt in singing a song of praise, extolling the lofty qualities of Jehovah. Our hearts feel the same way when we come to know Jehovah and the faithfulness he shows toward us. We want to imitate him. We want to make faithfulness to him our way of life. Our sentiments are the same as the apostle Paul’s: “For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.”—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Faithfulness involves what we do every day, even in little things. Jesus said: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.” (Luke 16:10) Our conduct in the community, the way we conduct ourselves at our secular work, the way we deal with others, all can attract people to the truth by way of our example. But do we go farther? Do we share in house-to-house witnessing as often as possible? Are we alert to witness to our workmates? To those met in traveling? To those who visit us? Jehovah is using his people to search out deserving ones in all the earth, and he sees to it that his people are brought in touch with good-hearted ones wherever they are. (Matt. 10:11-13) Thus, faithfulness will motivate us to use appropriate opportunities to preach.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> During June we will be featur-Communist can now be printed there, so, for the present, the Vietnamese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will not be available. But our brothers know Jehovah, and our prayer is that he will strengthen them to persist in a faithful course.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">We remember all of you in our prayers, and send warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brothers, </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font3">ing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font3">and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of $1.25. Since emphasis will be placed on Bible distribution in June, you may find it convenient to take along with you your copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation,</span><span class="font3"> or a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott,</span><span class="font3"> and when you meet persons interested in the Bible, you can show these to them. Some may be interested in getting the large-print edition of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> or Byington’s translation. Also, Bible study aids such as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font3"> book and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font3"> might be just what some are looking for to help them in their studies. And remember to demonstrate faithfulness by making definite arrangements to return where interest is shown in an effort to start a Bible study, knowing that most persons need help and encouragement if they are to progress spiritually.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Do you find that summer months go by very fast for you? They are busy months, but many have found that advance planning makes it possible to enlarge their opportunities to preach the good news. Perhaps you will find this to be the case also, as you think about ways to reach more people in your community with Jehovah’s lifesaving message. Some have found that temporary pioneer service is just what they need. Young folks out of school often are able to spend several months as temporary pioneers. Those who look back on a summer spent in temporary pioneering often say that it afforded them some of the happiest experiences in their life. And even if you cannot be a temporary pioneer, favorable weather, longer daylight hours, vacation periods and other factors may permit you to spend additional time in preaching.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Song </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">9. </span><span class="font13">In opening meeting, discuss Proverbs 28:20 and tie in need for faithfulness with discussion of Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">“Faithfulness—Our Way of Life.” Question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">24 min: </span><span class="font13">Imitate the Faithfulness of Daniel. Speaker can develop Bible account and let audience answer questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Daniel was called by God a “very desirable man.” (Dan. 10:11) How fine it is if God can say the same of us. And he does to certain faithful ones, for they are called “the desirable things of all the nations.” (Hag. 2:7) By considering Daniel’s faithful course we can build up our own faithfulness so that we can be “desirable” in God’s eyes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">(1) Daniel reflected his earlier training in God’s law when refusing as a youth to pollute himself with the delicacies of the king. (Dan. 1:8, 9) How is he an example for us today when some foods are known to be contaminated with blood or when one is under pressure to take a blood transfusion?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(2) Daniel never credited himself with wisdom. He did not look to his own ability. (Dan. 2:17, 18, 28-30) What does Daniel’s example show about how to get true wisdom?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(3) Daniel was fearless but respectful in speaking of God’s purposes when before King Belshazzar and his officials. (Dan. 5:22-28) How was Daniel an example in this regard for Christians today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(4) Daniel was not at all ambitious for position, authority or power. He acknowledged Jehovah as the source of the revelations he received. He carried out his responsibilities thoroughly but impartially and did not use his position to bring him special privileges or favors. (Dan. 5:16, 17) How can a knowledge of what Daniel did help us all to have the right viewpoint?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(5) Daniel kept practicing true worship of God when mischief was framed by law against him. (Dan. 6:5-11) How might we be confronted with a similar situation? What does Daniel 6:5 show as to what our conduct should be? How does his deliverance give us confidence and assurance in the face of persecution?—Dan. 6:16-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(6) Daniel’s long years of faithfulness resulted in the happv assurance of a resurrection. (Dan. 12:13) How is this a comfort to us?—Heb. 6:10-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">In discussing the above points, all or part of the scriptures cited may be read, as time allows. The discussion can then be centered around the scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding comments. Devote a few minutes to encouraging all to attend the district assembly all four days to enjoy the full benefit of the program. Tell briefly of arrangements made, as discussed under Announcements, for getting reports on the highlights of the assembly program when reviewed on the service meeting. Include brief accounts report and other Announcements that are appropriate for congregation. Song 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Song 65. Introduction and brief talk on need to show loyalty to all our brothers now and when times may be difficult, based on example of loyalty of Jonathan and David.—1 Sam. 18:1-3; 19:1-7; 20:1-42; see </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 957, 958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font13">“They Will All Be Taught by Jehovah.” Enthusiastic talk on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1975 Yearbook,</span><span class="font13"> p. 144 f3 to p. 168 UI. Tell the story, though every point cannot be covered. Emphasize that now, as in the past, God’s servants enjoy divine direction in their activities and are “taught by Jehovah.” (Isa. 54:13; John 6:45) The following questions can be used in presenting the material and, as time permits, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font13"> few can be answered by the audience: (1) God’s people expected what to happen in 1925, and how did faithful ones react when those expectations were not fulfilled? (P. 146) (2) Eager to be “taught by Jehovah.” what did the Bible Students eventually do about Christmas and other holidays? (P. 147) (3) Advancement in understanding led to what change in viewpoint regarding the cross? (Pp. 148, 149) (4) How did Jehovah make his people aware of the significance of Isaiah 43:12, especially in the year 1931? And how did A. H. Macmillan express himself about what took place that year in connection with the convention at Columbus, Ohio? (Pp. 149-151) (5) During the Great Depression, how did Jehovah’s witnesses use bartering methods at times to spread Scriptural truth? (Pp. 152, 153) (6) Jehovah’s spirit made his people fearless during the divisional campaigns. What were those campaigns like? (Pp. 153, 154) (7) In 1935, what was learned about the &quot;great multitude,” or “great crowd,” of Revelation chapter seven? (P. 156) (8) How was Kingdom-preaching done with sound cars? (Pp. 157, 158) (9) The phonograph work was carried on in what way? (Pp. 158, 159) (10) Beginning in 1940, how was street work done, and with what public reaction to it? (Pp. 160-164) (11) In 1932, 1937 and 1938, what changes were made in filling positions of responsibility within the Christian congregation? (Pp. 164-166) (12) How did zone service strengthen Jehovah’s people? (Pp. 167, 168)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Speaker can point out that God’s people are continually being taught by Jehovah. God is directing them in their preaching work and their congregational activities, even as he did in past years. Hence, as individuals, we have reason to appreciate the instruction and direction we are receiving from Jehovah through his organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">says Paul. (1 Cor. 4:2) This applies to men such as elders in the congregation, but we all want to be found faithful in caring for our commissioned work of preaching the good news. We feel a keen responsibility toward all the people in our assigned territory. How much more time we have for preaching the good news before the outbreak of the “great tribulation,” we cannot say. We know we are deep into the time of the end and the time is very short. But Jehovah’s people are resolved to continue preaching as long as he holds the way open. Their faithfulness in preaching is resulting in many more taking their stand for true worship and preparing for surviving the “great tribulation.” Jehovah’s promise at Psalm 101:6 is reassuring: “My eyes are upon the faithful ones of the earth, that they may dwell with me. The one walking in a faultless way, he it is who will minister to me.” Comforting also are his words: “But as for the righteous one, by his faithfulness he will keep living.”—Hab. 2:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Those who are reaching out for responsibility in the congregation, and everyone else who wants to please God, need to cultivate loyalty. What a fine quality loyalty is! This is especially true when it is combined with love, when it is true loyal love. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.”—Prov. 17:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Loyalty is regarded, in the English language, as faithful adherence to a sovereign or government, or to a leader or cause, but the Bible shows that more is involved; it is kindness that lovingly attaches itself to an object until its purpose in connection with that object is realized. Adversities do not cause one to abandon the deep friendship based on loyal love. Only unfaithfulness, really disloyalty, causes a breaking of this strong tie.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Of Jehovah it is said by those in his presence: “You alone are loyal.” (Rev. 15:4) Humans cannot begin to match Jehovah’s perfect and balanced loyalty, but we can seek to imitate his lofty example. (Eph. 5:1) We love because he first loved us. (1 John 4:10, 11) Within the Christian congregation we are drawn together in a loving loyalty to Jehovah and to one another. “True righteousness and loyalty” are included in the new</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Elders are to be “loyal” in an exemplary way as they shepherd the flock. (Titus 1:8, 9) Loyal love toward Jehovah will impel them not only to be exemplary in shouldering their responsibilities, but to stand alongside their faithful fellow servants when these are reproached or faced with trials. Their work is to uphold Jehovah’s name in the congregation and before the community. (2 Cor. 7:1) In giving counsel, they are obligated to stick to the faithful Word of God. They are always to be on the alert to see that uncleanness, false teachings and divisions are not allowed in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Loyal love will cause us to overlook the unintentional sins and weaknesses of one another, “because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8) On the other hand, loyalty to God will help us to avoid misplaced loyalty, the tendency to support others, particularly close friends, even if they are doing wrong. In ancient Israel, those who were witnesses to wrongdoing were to tell the elders what they knew, in order to avoid sharing the blame for a possible wrong decision.—Lev. 5:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching All with the Good News</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> With the beginning of summer, special efforts are suggested to reach those parts of the territory that may not have been covered recently. This will include rural territory for many congregations. In urban assignments, certain sections or maybe the business territory may need attention. Under the supervision of the field overseer, perhaps group work may be planned to cover all this territory during the summer months. Can you share in this special effort?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In working rurals and small towns that are some distance away, many have found it possible to spend long days in the field service. This gets the maximum accomplished after spending time traveling to the territory. Some groups have taken along a picnic lunch to eat after their morning service and before spending several hours more in the field service in the afternoon. Many fine experiences have been enjoyed by those who have arranged to share in covering territory worked less frequently. Do not forget that in the summertime there may be vegetables and other items to' trade if some desire to have the literature but do not have the money.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In rural territory where the distance between houses is often great, it is advisable to keep the car groups small. Where a small town is to be worked, part of the car group might be left off there, along with a quantity of literature, while the others work the scattered territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> When interested ones are located, plans should be made to visit them again in an effort to start a Bible study. If studies cannot be conducted every week, a group might go into an area every two weeks to conduct the studies started. The Bible study overseer might coordinate this as needed. Jehovah’s blessing can be expected on these special efforts to reach people with the good news in the “byways” of our territory assignment.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Eternal Purpose” Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Having just completed the study of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose” </span><span class="font3">book at the congregation book studies, you know the value of it and can point out some of its fine features as you speak to others about it in July when this book will be offered. How can this best be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> You know that people in general have little idea of God’s original purpose for the earth and humans. In fact, if they believe in God at all, many feel that God has left man to work things out in the earth, whether for good or for bad. In view of this, you may find it best in your territory to avoid asking people at the very outset of your presentation how they think on these points, which likely would result in a negative reply. Better results may be obtained by stating matters positively and then getting the householder’s opinion. Here is a suggested presentation, after a friendly introduction:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> “The Bible shows that God had a definite purpose in mind in creating the earth and placing man upon it. Peace, happiness and plenty were to be enjoyed by all. Would you not like to see these conditions here on the earth? [Pause for reply, if householder is inclined. Whether he does so or not, you usually will be able to continue as follows.] It has been centuries since the first human pair lost perfection due to sinning against God, but God has not forgotten his purpose for the earth; and he has not been slow in developing it. Note what the Bible has to say on this at 2 Peter 3:9 [read].</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> “So God, in permitting some time to elapse, has really allowed opportunity for us to learn about his purpose and to do the things required by him if we are to live in the restored paradise. Did you know that time is running out and that the Bible indicates that soon God will sweep away unrighteousness and establish a whole new system of things? [If person is listening well and it seems appropriate, you might add: “See how this is confirmed a few verses later, at 2 Peter 3:13 (read).” Otherwise, go right to the book presentation.]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> “This book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God’s ‘Eternal Purpose’ Now Triumphing for Man’s Good,</span><span class="font3"> discusses in detail how God’s purpose to restore an earthly paradise will be fulfilled, and how you personally can benefit from this grand purpose. We offer this book on a small contribution of 25 cents.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Another approach might be to use the table of contents of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font3"> book. Hand a copy to the householder and let him read the titles of certain chapters as you point them out and say a few words of explanation. “The title of the first chapter is reassuring, isn’t it?—‘We Are Within the Purpose of a Loving Creator.’ After telling something of the grand qualities of God as Creator, the book shows how he got the first man and woman off to a fine start in the paradise of Eden. We learn how Adam and Eve lost this paradise home, not only for themselves, but also for their offspring, including us. But right after this God stated his ‘eternal purpose’ to do away with the effects of sin and death. The book traces the history of this developing purpose to the coming of Christ, and shows how we can benefit from the provisions made through him. God’s purpose to have perfect men and women on earth serving him forever will not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font3"> unfulfilled. We invite you to obtain this book so you can read how you personally can live in God’s paradise earth, soon to be a reality. This copy can be yours for just 25 cents.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> You may prefer to use another approach that you have found effective. The important thing is to appeal to the heart.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">carrying on acts that could result in disfellowshiping—you should in true loyalty help the elders with all the factual information you have. This is not “squealing,” as it is known in the old world. In love for such ones, you may first choose to admonish that they go to the elders themselves and reveal their wrong, but they should understand that, if they do not go, you will do so. Really, it is loyalty to erring ones to help the elders to know the full circumstances so that needed help can be given, with a view to</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font13">• What are some factors to have in mind in arranging for a wedding ceremony at the Kingdom Hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is assumed that a couple desiring to have their wedding at the Kingdom Hall wish to put the emphasis on the spiritual aspects of the wedding. When elders on the service committee grant permission for the use of the Kingdom Hall, it is expected that the hall will not be rearranged beyond simple changes the elders approve of. For example, some adjustments in the seating arrangements may be advisable if the chairs are movable, flowers may be desired, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to a rehearsal, the elders may wish to permit such if it is held at a time that does not interfere with congregation activities. This can aid those in the wedding party to familiarize themselves with the procedure they will follow at the wedding. But reasonableness should also be exercised as to the extent and elaborateness of rehearsals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If the couple desires that a brief announcement be made at a congregation meeting of the time of their wedding as an event that will take place at the Kingdom Hall, this may be done. Those hearing the announcement can, of course, decide personally whether or not they desire to attend. (In making wedding arrangements, a review of the January 15, 1969, and May 1, 1974, issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> will be helpful.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">aiding the erring ones not to lose out on everlasting life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Loyalty to God, coupled with the counsel of his Word, provides a climate of understanding and respect in which our relationships with one another can grow. It can help to keep us from imposing our conscience on others in personal tastes where there is no violation of Scriptural principles involved. For example, only where matters go to the extreme in clothing styles or grooming and things of this nature might the elders feel the need to provide Scriptural advice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Loyalty to God and to our brothers brings peace and a good conscience to us. It promotes greater love and loyalty on the part of others and the smile of approval from God. Congregation prayers will be heard and answered by him. (1 Tim. 2:8) With the good spirit that loyalty promotes, we can have greater freeness of speech toward God and toward men.—Heb. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

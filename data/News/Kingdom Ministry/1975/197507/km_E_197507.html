<p><span class="font10">When one thinks of the United States, one thinks of an Englishspeaking country, and, of course, it is. But, interestingly, there are more than 36,000 publishers in our Spanish congregations too. We ship a tremendous amount of literature from Brooklyn to Spanish congregations all over this country, and, next to the English, the quantity of Spanish literature far exceeds anything else. You will be interested in knowing too that we have quite a few French and Italian congregations in the country, and a lot of literature in these languages is placed, not only by publishers who speak French or Italian, but by others when they meet people who would appreciate it. In addition to this, we ship out quite a bit of German, Greek and Portuguese literature. And the brothers who write the invoices here are amazed at the large quantities of Japanese and Chinese literature that continually go out for use in the field. These eight are the principal languages, other than English, that are used in the United States right now. It certainly is good to know that people coming from other countries are being reached and provided with literature in their own tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everyone has heard about recent events in Vietnam. A few of our Vietnamese brothers and sisters were able to leave as refugees and have come to America. Brothers in this country offered to sponsor them, and we understand that all of them have been cared for. Others, of course, remain in Vietnam. We are now trying to get into the camps housing those who left their country as refugees, to present these people with Bible literature or at least to give them talks. We have loving concern for these people who speak other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You will be interested in knowing that Brother M. G. Henschel is on a trip to serve the branches in the northern part of Europe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings Keep Us Together</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Nothing can be more important than preserving a good relationship with Jehovah and our brothers. Meetings play a vital role in doing that. Now, more so than ever, ‘gathering ourselves together’ is a custom we cannot afford to forsake. —Heb. 10:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A good relationship with Jehovah depends on the way we worship him. Mere passive worship has never been acceptable. Every requirement of pure worship involves “earnest effort.” (2 Pet. 1: 5) Attending meetings is one of the ways we make that effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our meetings are designed to teach us about Jehovah and to help us to understand his will more clearly. It pleases him when we take a keen interest in learning. Faithfully returning to weekly meetings can be likened to an often-repeated petition to Jehovah, saying, “Instruct me ... in your way.” (Ps. 27:11) When all assume the role of humble learners before him, it is his good pleasure to reveal himself intimately for our blessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* Our verbal expression in meetings constitutes a “public declaration of our hope” and this is pleasing to him. (Heb. 10:23; 13:16) The never-ending study of his marvelous qualities shows him our desire to imitate them in our own lives. He has visited Iceland, Ireland and England, and in all of these countries the Kingdom work is progressing nicely. Things are changing in Ireland. Many now have an ear to hear. Regardless of the language, the nationality, the location, Jehovah’s people are very much interested in getting the good news preached everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We hope that you are going to have an excellent time at the convention, if you have not already attended one, and may Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">(Eph. 5:1) This effort to “draw close to God” through meetings elicits his goodwill aild helps to establish firmly the basis for an enduring friendship.—Jas. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Meetings also draw us close to our brothers. The wholesome atmosphere is conducive to the ways of peace. Minds are filled with godly thoughts that produce a unifying display of the fruits of God’s spirit. Strong ties with others are readily formed when reverence before Jehovah minimizes feelings of personal importance. A sharing of common interests dispells distrust ordinarily separating those from differing backgrounds. Our very presence is a gesture inviting friendship. An effort to share with others what we have learned confirms our love for them and our desire to see them obtain Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> As we increase the number of acquaintances among our brothers, we are rewarded with a greater appreciation for the “entire association” of brothers around the world. (1 Pet. 5:9) The better we get to know them, the stronger our confidence becomes in their love for us. When difficulties threaten, we feel no dread, knowing that our brothers care and will do all they can to help us. In times of stress, these bonds help the weak to be strong and all to endure hardship. (Eccl. 4:11, 12) Each one’s faith is made more firm by the constant “interchange of encouragement.” (Rom. 1:11, 12) What other provision has contributed so much to the joy and unity of Jehovah’s people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Many blessings have come to us because we have made the effort to preserve good relations with Jehovah and our brothers. Constant instruction has made us, religiously speaking, the best-informed people in the world. We know our God as we know a close </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">(Co</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">nt</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">inued on</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"> page </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">3, col. 2</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">)__</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(1) Since Matt. 24 applied in period up to 70 C.E., how do we know ft has application now? (Prophecy of Rev. 6:1-8. written after 70 C.E., parallels Matt. 24:6-8 and shews it has future application.) (is 122-128) Jerusalem’s destruction was not worst catastrophe In hlstorv.

[Read Matt. 5:3.] . . .&quot; “Jesus taught his followers to make this kingdom the most Important thing In their lives. [Read Matt. 6:33.] . . .&quot; “Jesus described this hope as a treasure worth more than anything else we could possess. [Read Matt. 13:44.1 . .

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In outlining the qualifications for an overseer, the Bible says that one way he is to be exemplary is in “presiding over his own household in a fine manner.” That is reasonable, for if he “does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God's congregation?” (1 Tim. 3: 4, 5) Of course, all Christian fathers, whether overseers or not, should sense the need to preside over their families in a fine manner. What is involved?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> With regard to his wife, it certainly would mean being a kind and loving husband. (Eph. 5:25, 28, 33) When dealt with in that manner, a wife—even an unbeliever —likely will respond with cooperation and affection. Yet, in certain households, a wife may oppose her husband or follow an immoral course. (Matt. 10:36) Does that mean that he is failing to preside in a fine manner? If the husband genuinely is applying to the best of his ability God’s counsel for husbands, his wife’s choosing a course of badness need not be understood as a failure on his part. (Jer. 3:20; Ezek. 16:8, 20) For any husband, though, to be presiding in a fine manner, it should be evident that he is doing his best to apply God's counsel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We can appreciate that a father who is presiding in a fine manner exerts himself to guide and care for his children. Much time and attention are involved in properly instructing them, aiding them both</span></p></li></ul>

(Ps. 78:5-7; 34:11; Eph. 6:4) He cannot be neglecting them because he is more interested in working with or helping other people, or because he feels that his children will automatically “come out all right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> But what if, despite his fine efforts, a son or a daughter commits a wrong act or goes completely wayward? It does not necessarily mean that the father is at fault. Some of Jehovah’s spirit sons rebelled and so did his first two children on earth. And we definitely know that Jehovah was not negligent. So if a family member of an overseer does take a bad course, the question is, To what extent does the father bear responsibility? Perhaps, when the parents learned the truth, the youngster was already a teen-ager and never did become a believer. Has the father done all that reasonably could be expected of a Christian family head? If so, the delinquency of one or more members would not necessarily disqualify him from being an overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What praise goes to Jehovah when Christian family heads have success in presiding in a fine manner, resulting in “having believing children that [are] not under a charge of debauchery nor unruly”!

With so many evidences of his goodwill, we have proof that Jehovah really does care for us.—1 Pet. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> We are happy when we are with our brothers, secure in the company of those genuinely at peace. No more are we drained by tension and competition that accompany the pursuit of selfish interests. We can warmly welcome new ones, showing genuine hospitality. From our own experience, we can testify that love is indeed “a perfect bond of union.”—Col. 3:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How Do You View Confidential Matters?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As Christians we have many fine things that we can enjoy discussing—Scriptural points, experiences, conventions. Still, the Bible shows that some self-control is necessary regarding what we talk about. (Ps. 34:13; Prov. 10:19) We would not, for example, want to be slanderously spreading harmful talk or be one who indiscriminately tells everything he hears.—Prov. 20:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We are open and honest people, not suspiciously secretive. But some matters are confidential and we should not discuss them without authorization. This may not be easy, for we might be tempted with the impulse to share with a friend a confidential matter we learned. Also, it takes discipline not to try to pry confidential information from others.—Judg. 16: 15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> What are some areas where this is so? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Family:</span><span class="font10"> In the confidence of your family you may learn of a family member’s weakness or private plans. Yet, husband, wife and children should not publicly converse about everything that happens or is planned in the family. (Ps. 50:20) One aspect of family love is that one’s family members are trustworthy. This is something that parents can help children to learn. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Employment: </span><span class="font10">Revealing your employer’s business details or plans could cause him financial harm. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation: </span><span class="font10">Elders maintain confidence about problems they handle, for if someone confided in an elder about a spiritual or family problem and he talked about it publicly, others might hesitate to seek help from any elder. (Jas. 5:13-16) Even if, out of curiosity, his wife or child asked, an elder should not reveal confidential congregational matters. Thus he avoids burdening his family with keeping confidence on such congregation matters. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">April 1, 1971, pp. 222-224)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Having this view of confidential matters, we can concentrate on speech that is upbuilding, helpful. —Prov. 25:9; 16:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">think of not attending? Do you not feel grateful to Jehovah for these abundant spiritual provisions at a time when we have such a great need? When do we feel closer to him and our brothers than we do at meetings? How fitting that we conclude every meeting with a prayer of heartfelt thanks, then go home “joyful and feeling good at heart.”—2 Chron. 7:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With Warm Appeal from the Heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A conversation that is open, honest, sincere, straightforward, we call a “heart-to-heart” talk. When each one is convinced that the other is sincere, there is a wholesome interchange. (Rom. 1:12) Good communication and better relations result because the heart responds to a warm appeal that is genuine. Inner emotions are touched, favorably influencing thoughts and actions. Sharing the good news with such a warm appeal is an ideal goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Reaching another’s heart depends largely on what is in your own heart. Ask yourself: Is my motive one of love, an unselfish interest in others? When I call at a home, am I there because I want to be, not just because I feel it is my duty? (1 Cor. 9:16) Do I feel a desire to help people? Is my attitude one of joy? Others are quick to sense our motives, and this profoundly affects their response to what we say.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Your manner of approach is also important. It is a reflection of your feelings. A householder’s opinion of the good news may be formed primarily on his impression of you as an individual. What kind of person does your manner show you to be?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A warm smile suggests a pleasant friend, while a stern look causes apprehension. Confidence is respected, but an overconfident, overbearing attitude repels. The ear will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hear</span><span class="font10"> a businesslike tone of voice but is more likely to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">listen </span><span class="font10">to one that is warm, inviting. A person will open up more freely in a conversational chat than he will in a formal discussion. Many times a less fluent person will achieve better results than someone eloquent. Why? Because, even though not especially fluent, he may speak sincerely from the heart. Sincerity</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God has not forgotten or abandoned his purpose.—2 Pet. 3:9. We can be sure of its fulfillment soon.—2 Pet. 3:13. of heart contributes toward a free flow of Jehovah’s spirit. A modest, well-groomed appearance adds dignity and encourages respect.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Good- manners identify you as a thoughtful, sensitive person. A high regard for the feelings of others is universally appreciated. If your knock awakens a daytime sleeper, a sincere apology may result in a kindly reception. Someone truly inconvenienced by your call will think more highly of the good news if you tactfully suggest a visit at a later time. Willingness to be an attentive listener may give you more opportunities to speak effectively than would be open to one who monopolizes the conversation. Giving a sympathetic ear to a personal problem may lead to an extended witness. Thoughtfully remembering to close a screen door or a gate tells the householder that you are concerned about his interests.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">° Discernment in choosing the theme of your presentation can also add to the warmth of your appeal. With so much that is bad, everyone yearns to hear good news. An important aspect of our commission is to spread good news of hope. Recall that Jesus emphasized good news, saying that he had been anointed to “declare good news to the poor.” (Luke 4: 17-21) You may want to try a cheerful presentation that highlights the marvelous prospects for endless life and peace. Perhaps you will find that you can reach another’s heart quickly with reassuring words that describe how he and his loved ones can realistically hope to enjoy good health and happiness in a secure future, provided he shows faith in God’s promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Of course, many have allowed bad influences to harden their hearts to such a degree that the word of truth cannot take root. (Luke 8:5, 12) Let this not discourage us. Rather, let us be like the “good man” Jesus described who “brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart.” (Luke 6:45) Our efforts to do that in the disciple-making work will be rewarded with many more sheeplike hearts touched by the good news.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font0">♦ Response to the good news has been great among the foreign-speaking population in the United States. The largest group is Spanish, with 549 congregations in 24 states. They have 24 circuits. There were 74 new Spanish congregations formed last year and 41 have already been started this year. There are 768 regular pioneers working in Spanish-speaking territories. Additionally, there are nine French, two Chinese, two Italian, two Portuguese, one Korean and one Greek congregation taking care of the population speaking those languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ In April, Haiti reached a new peak of 3,587 publishers. Memorial attendance was 14,880—more than 400 percent the number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ A report of field-service activity was received for the first time from Timor, an island about 400 miles northwest of Australia. A special pioneer couple moved there to core for the island, whose inhabitants speak primarily Chinese and Tetum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">• What can be done when meeting attendance exceeds the seating capacity of the Kingdom Hall but the congregation is not yet in position to divide?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many congregations have experienced a rapid influx of new ones with the result that seating accommodations have become Inadequate, especially at Sunday meetings. Formation of another congregation may not be necessary in every case to remedy the problem. Experience has shown that prematurely dividing of a congregation can have a discouraging effect. The following are some guidelines that the elders can consider:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where a large congregation is to be divided, it is recommended that the new congregation have 75 or 80 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font8"> publishers available before being formed. Also, sufficient qualified brothers should be available to care for responsibilities of oversight. If only the Sunday meetings are overcrowded, the congregation could consider having two public meetings and two </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> studies. The congregation could be divided up by book study groups to attend the different meetings. The same brother could give both public talks, with a different </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study conductor for each group. This would alleviate crowding in the Kingdom Hall and still allow the congregation to have good experience to draw on for service meeting parts and Ministry School assignments. Later, when the congregation grows larger, consideration could be given to forming a new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where a large number of publishers live In another town and considerable travel Is Involved In getting to the meetings, or other local extenuating circumstances exist, the forming of a new congregation may be advisable even though Its size may not be what is recommended above. In such cases the body of elders can write requesting a Congregation Information Letter, which provides further details.</span></p>

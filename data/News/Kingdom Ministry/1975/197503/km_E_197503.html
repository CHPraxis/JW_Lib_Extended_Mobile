<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 1975 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“| will say to Jehovah: *You are my refuge and my stronghold.’”—Ps. 91:2. VOL. XVIII NO. 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Have you heard the latest news? Remember, back in July your congregation received a letter about the possibility of the Society’s buying much-needed property to house more members of the Bethel family. Well, the Society bought this property—the Towers Hotel building—on January 17. A picture of this large building appears on the first endsheet of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1975 Yearbook. </span><span class="font9">Eventually it may house some 1,000 members of the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In recent weeks the Bethel family has been delighted with letters from Brother Knorr about his zone visits while on an around-the-world trip with Brother F. W. Franz. In connection with these visits special meetings have been held. In Portugal, for example, the brothers had two large gatherings with a combined attendance of 46,870. Imagine the joy of the brothers there in being able to sing and pray publicly for the first time! Just three days before the first of those meetings, Jehovah’s Christian witnesses were granted legal recognition there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From Brother Knorr’s reports we have learned that things are really moving ahead in many lands. In Germany, excavation has begun on a new Bethel home, and a recently purchased factory building is being cleaned and remodeled. Arrangements were made to enlarge the branches in Switzerland and Italy. And a new Bethel home, factory and office are being planned for Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers in Greece are very happy now that the government is allowing them to have public meetings. Brothers Franz and Knorr were overjoyed to be able to address a combined audience of 11,644 during five meetings held there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several other brothers from Brooklyn Bethel have been making zone visits in Africa and in South and Central America. It has been most encouraging to receive firsthand reports from these areas. During zone visits in January, the Chile branch dedicated a new print-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> How blessed we are to worship and serve </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> merciful God. (Ps. 145:8, 9) We live because He permitted the human race descended from Adam to come into existence and to benefit from His generous provisions for sustaining life in spite of their sinful condition. (Matt. 5:45; Luke 6:35, 36; Acts 17:24, 25) Jehovah God also mercifully provided the basis for liberating us from sin and death. —1 John 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> He “does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Our imitating Jehovah’s merciful patience requires that we have real concern for the people in our territory, engaging in preaching, not merely as a routine, but with an earnest desire to give all an opportunity to hear the truth. This is certainly what we want to be doing in the month of March, do we not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> One way in which we can show merciful concern for others is by making good use of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> That magazine can be instrumental in opening up people’s hearts to respond to the truth. Many need to have their faith in the dependability of God’s Word strengthened. The March 1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> with its fine discussion on the inspiration and value of the Bible, is just what they need. Others are discouraged by the injustices they see. Would they not be built up by the Maren 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> article “Life Free from Injustice—Is It Just a Dream?” You may also find the section “Insight on the News” helpful in arousing interest in what the Bible ery, and the Ecuador branch dedicated a new two-story addition.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Indeed, marvelous things are happening. May all of us continue to be faithful in helping many more people to benefit fully from Jehovah’s mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your brothers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font9">says about world events. What fine material we can point to in making the subscription offer! Because we deeply care about the people in our territory, we want to help them to see how beneficial it would be for them to receive the magazines on a subscription basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■* Because of our merciful concern for others, we should want to keep accurate and complete house-to-house records. This will enable us to make return visits, showing that we really care about those who have shown some interest. When making a return visit, you might start a Scriptural conversation, perhaps based on an article contained in a magazine you placed, and then offer a subscription. Even when no placements were made but interest was shown, on returning you could center your conversation on printed information that may be of interest to the householder and endeavor to start a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We also want to have in mind encouraging as many as possible to be present for the Memorial of Christ’s death on March 27. It would be spiritually upbuilding for those in the territory to visit the Kingdom Hall that evening and have the opportunity to meditate on Jesus Christ’s role as a ransomer and on Jehovah’s great love for mankind. Being with us on that important occasion, they may be motivated to leave “Babylon the Great” and to show appreciation for God’s mercy toward them. You may wish to spend a day just inviting Bible students and other interested persons to attend the Memorial. And how good it would be if, as a result of your invitation, you would be able to welcome some of these interested persons at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>0</sup> The month of March will end with the timely special public talk “’Who Is Jehovah,’ so that All Should Worship Him?” This is cer-</span></p>

South African brothers responded, mailing parcels to camps. This proved very costly, but brothers in South Africa were willing to bear cost themselves. Relief funds contributed by brothers world wide were used too. Also, you may relate how brothers In Germany shared scant bread rations, often ]ust crumbs. [yb74, p. 176] Would we be willing to do that?) (2) If one of our brothers is sick, how could we show mercy to him? (w 9/15/74, p. 570) Situations that could come up are: The mother may be In the hospital and the father mav be working. Who will care for the children? An elderly sister living by herself may get very sick. (3) In the event a publisher dies, how could members of the congregation assist the rest of the family?

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Reasonableness is certainly a most desirable quality. It is hard to work with someone who is unreasonable, stubborn, demanding, authoritative and critical. (Ezek. 34:4) But there is something truly refreshing about one who is considerate, understanding and does not insist on the letter of the law. Little wonder, then, that the Scriptures encourage all of us, not just elders, to manifest reasonableness. —Phil. 4:5; Titus 3:1, 2; Jas. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What will help us to be reasonable with our brothers? We should keep in mind that the Christian congregation is composed of people having different backgrounds, customs and ways of life. Regardless of their weaknesses, imperfections and the extent of their spiritual progress, they want to do God’s will. Our recognizing this will help us to be understanding and to give due consideration to their circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Brothers who are “reaching out” for the fine work of oversight in the Christian congregation should especially be concerned about setting an example in displaying fairness, moderation and forbearance, looking humanely and reasonably at their brothers’ abilities, problems and circumstances. (1 Tim. 3:1, 3) The reasonable person looks for the good in his brothers, seeking to commend and encourage. He does not quickly condemn others for minor failings. Nor does he make big issues over</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">You may use as a subject the title of the opening article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> or an item in the section “Insight on the News.” trifles and give people the impression that he is hard to please, that nothing really suits him. (Compare 1 Corinthians 9:12, 18-23; 1 Peter 2:18.) While encouraging others to progress, he recognizes that they have limitations, likes and dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■* When we consider the responsibilities of elders, we can see why reasonableness is one of the qualifications for elders. It is refreshing to the whole congregation. In handling matters as a judicial committee, reasonable elders take the individual into consideration. A major concern is to give Scriptural help designed to meet his needs so that he may recover from spiritual weakness. Manifesting reasonableness, the elders do not act like judges handing down verdicts without any consideration of mercy. Also, at other times, when giving counsel or distributing responsibilities in the congregation, they do not ignore circumstances and a person’s limitations. Basing their counsel on God’s Word, they appeal to their brothers’ love of right. They are also willing to listen to suggestions and to apply counsel that is given to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Truly, when the whole congregation strives to display reasonableness, this helps to make our service to God, not a burden, but a delight. (Matt. 11:28-30) May all of us continue to work hard in developing to a greater degree that refreshing quality of reasonableness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">About New Brothers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As dedicated servants of Jehovah we are obligated to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) To do that, we must know our brothers. In view of the great increases being experienced, this may require putting forth extraordinary effort to ‘widen out’ in our love so that new ones will not feel neglected.—2 Cor. 6:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We should give thoughtful consideration to what new ones in our midst might be facing. Some may find themselves in a divided household, perhaps being subjected to ridicule and abuse. Former friends may have turned against them. Because of such things, these new ones may feel discouraged and lonely. If we know what they are up against, we can encourage them and make them feel wanted and appreciated.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Jesus Christ said of those who had taken up the yoke of discipleship: “No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields.” (Mark 10:29, 30) Individually we</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Our Merciful God </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font9">tainly a subject that should be widely advertised in our territory. Also, we want to be sure to encourage those who attended the Memorial to be present, do we not? If need be, why not arrange to pick them up?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> With so much activity ahead, could you perhaps arrange to be a temporary pioneer? How many of you who will have school vacation would like to enjoy this privilege of service in March or April? If you can share in temporary pioneer service, talk to the presiding overseer and he will gladly furnish you with an application. Even if you are unable to pioneer, why not put forth a special effort to devote as much time in field service as your circumstances reasonably allow?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah God has truly set an outstanding example in showing mercy. Surely, in the months ahead, we want to be found imitating him. May our depth of concern for people and our faithful efforts in their behalf help many to come to know Jehovah as his obedient servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Without Prejudgment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> All people are entitled to hear the “good news.” Jesus Christ died, not for just a few, but “for all.” (2 Cor. 5:14) We should be careful, therefore, not to prejudge people, thinking that it would be a waste of time to revisit them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> True, there are people who may accept literature simply as a kind gesture. However, regardless of the attitude they might have on the initial call, we do not know the inclinations of their hearts nor can we be sure of the effect the literature may have on them. We may have seen and talked to the individual only once. So would it not be sad if our prejudgment caused a person to lose valuable time in getting started on the way to life?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Deep concern for fellow humans will also cause us to take note of people who manifest some interest in the Bible but accept no literature. When some interest is shown you can lay the basis for a return visit. Before leaving, you could mention that you would like to talk to the householder again, sharing additional points from the Bible with him. Try to determine what might be a good subject to talk about when you return. You could also find out when it would be best to call back. After you leave the house, note that information on your house-to-house record. To prepare yourself for the return visit, you could select scriptures from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines,</span><span class="font9"> a magazine article or a chapter from one of the books. You may need to make a number of calls to stimulate the householder’s interest sufficiently to want to study the Bible with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> While not all our efforts may bear fruit, we can rest assured that Jehovah is pleased with our imitating his concern for mankind. Moreover, at times the completely unexpected happens. Take the case of a woman in Martinique. During a period of some four and a half years she refused to listen to the Witnesses. When a sister who had often been turned away called with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font9"> the woman said: “I already told you so many times that I am not interested at all.” Replied the sister: “It is just to give you this tract that is being distributed world wide. It is very important. Please take it.” The woman did accept the tract. Concerned about the apparently “opposed” woman, the sister was anxious to find out what effect the tract might have had on her and returned two weeks later. Imagine her delight when, after being invited into the home, the woman agreed to have a Bible study. Now this woman is a zealous publisher. She often tells the sister: “If I had only known, I would have accepted it long ago. I lost so much time.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We never know what might develop. Response may not be very enthusiastic on the initial call. Yet that can change. Something we said may cause the householder to think, or a point in the literature placed may stimulate his interest. Our genuinely friendly way may impress him. However, neglect due to our prejudgment could cause interest to diminish. That is why we have good reason to be diligent in our follow-up work, demonstrating our being in full harmony with Jehovah’s desire that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Question</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">• Are repentant wrongdoers &quot;placed&quot; or &quot;put on” public or private reproof as If placed on probation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No. A reproof is a congregational </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">expression of disapproval</span><span class="font7"> occasioned by a serious wrongdoing that could have led to the dlsfellowshiping of one of Its baptized members If he had been unrepentant. (1 Tim. 5:20: Titus 1:10-13) Once that expression of disapproval Is made, the reproof Is complete. The Individual does not enter a period of continued reprimand and so is not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">under </span><span class="font7">reproof, &quot;put on probation” as It were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why, then, are restrictions In effect? Serious sin committed by a member of the congregation manifests spiritual weakness on his part. As a person who Is physically 111 may be restricted from eating certain foods or from engaging In certain activities until his condition shows marked Improvement, so a person who Is spiritually weak may be relieved of certain responsibilities In the congregation until there is evidence of his regaining spiritual strength. The restrictions are to a large extent Intended to help the repentant wrongdoer recover from spiritual weakness and to Impress upon him the Importance of respecting God's holiness.—Gal. 6:7-9; see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">or, p.</span><span class="font7"> 167.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If a brother who has recently been reproved moves to another congregation. It Is advisable to Inform the elders of that congregation as to any restrictions that may oe in effect. This will enable the elders in his new congregation to continue supervising the restoration of his privileges and to aid him toward full spiritual recovery. Of course, no announcement of such previous reproof is made In the new congregation. At ail times elders should Imitate the merciful way in which Jehovah dealt with his people ^ven when discipline was needed. —Isa. 63:7-9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">might ask ourselves: Am I widening out in my concern for the brothers, including new ones, so that they feel they have gained a loving brother or sister, father or mother, son or daughter? Do</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup><a name="bookmark11"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"> make them welcome in my home</span></p>

<p><sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup><a name="bookmark14"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> Of course, being viewed by others as a close brother or sister, father or mother, son or daughter does not come automatically. We must demonstrate that we truly are such, not taking undue advantage of Christian hospitality and not always expecting to be on the receiving end. (2 Thess. 3:10-12) Rather, may all of us continue to “practice giving” of ourselves, our time, energies and assets, and thus experience a happiness greater than that which results from receiving.—Luke 6:38; Acts 20:35.</span></p>

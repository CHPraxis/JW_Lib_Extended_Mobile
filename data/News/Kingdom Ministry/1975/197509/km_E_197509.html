<p><span class="font13">We thought you would be interested in the theocratic progress in New York city these days and we are happy to share some thoughts with you in this regard. Some thrilling developments are taking place. For example, there are now 266 congregations, with a total of 26,285 publishers, including 878 pioneers. With 63,813 persons at the Memorial this March, this means that one out of every 124 persons in New York city attended the Memorial. The Bethel family contributes much to the activity of the New York city congregations, and there are currently 346 members of the Bethel family who serve as elders in the various congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A concerted effort is being put forth to reach every individual in this huge metropolis with the good news. To illustrate: 21 brothers and 5 sisters spend a minimum of two hours weekly visiting the prisons in the city. This program is carried out in cooperation with the New York City Department of Correction and is already producing fine results. At one prison a regular study with an average attendance of 8 is conducted in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book each Wednesday evening. In some prisons, cell-to-cell witnessing is possible, and brothers are diligent in making return visits, conducting studies, giving Bible lectures, and showing the Society’s films. As a result, one inmate, after studying for several months, made his dedication to serve Jehovah, and three months after his release he was baptized at a circuit assembly. In one prison the captain of the guards, who was once associated with Jehovah’s people, has also begun to attend meetings again and is now participating in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Also, a number of the brothers are making calls on ships docked in port and much literature in a number of different languages is regularly placed. Additionally, a number of pioneers have been</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Way!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How wonderful it is to be alive today, sharing in the worship of our heavenly Father, Jehovah! Those of us who have been in the truth for some years are thrilled to see the many new ones flocking to Jehovah’s family-like organization. (Isa. 60:22) We deeply appreciate seeing their faith, their devotion and their zeal as evidence that they have chosen to follow God’s way, not the ways of this world.—Compare Deuteronomy 30: 19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As we enter the 1976 service year all of us are filled with anticipation for the near future, for our generation. Of course, we cannot set a date as to when the old system is going to end, can we? Jesus plainly said that we do not know the day or the hour when the “great tribulation” is to begin, but obviously we can see that the hour is late. (Matt. 24:34, 36) Appreciating Jehovah’s way, we are convinced that he will not fail to fulfill all the things he has promised his servants. As Paul wrote to the Hebrews: “The word of God is alive and exerts power.” It will accomplish what Jehovah has purposed. Further, Paul wrote: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.” (Heb. 4:12; 6:10) Thus all of us, whether in the truth a short time, or a longer time, working the business territory, and one of these met a lawyer who took several books. The following week the pioneer made a return visit. Upon examining the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font13"> book the lawyer said: “This is just what I need.” On a later visit the man divulged that he was already using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font13"> book to explain Bible thoughts to his secretary and receptionist. Great praise is being given to Jehovah’s name as a result of all these marvelous efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 6. Brother opening meeting can discuss Deuteronomy 30:19, 20, emphasizing need to seek life by conforming to God’s way of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Presenting the Good News —Using the Bible in Introducing Ourselves.” Audience discussion together with several short demonstrations, if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Choose Life—Follow God’s Way!” Questions and answers. Could interview new ones relative to privilege of sharing in the field service, commenting at meetings and using the Bible in the house-to-house work. Get heartfelt expressions of appreciation. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font12">Concluding comments. Encourage each one to use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book fully this month. Cover accounts report, also highlights of Branch Letter. Tie in comments on “True ‘Rehabilitation.’ ” (7/8/75 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> p. 29) Urge brothers to study for part on Pride and Humility next week.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shun Pride—Cultivate Humility</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 87. Introduction, followed by talk on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article of August 1, 1975, “Youths, Make Your Life Worth Living.” Highlight the good and proper attitude that Christian youths, should have, not being filled with the pride and worldliness of this system of things, but with true humility. Make local application, where possible, to encourage young ones in the congregation. (If there is a qualified younger brother available, a ministerial servant, one who is a good example, might be advisable to assign him this talk.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">30 min: </span><span class="font12">Elder discusses with audience the qualities of pride and humility. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pride</span><span class="font12"> defined as inordinate self-esteem, an unreasoning -feeling of superiority as to one’s talents. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Humility,</span><span class="font12"> just the opposite, means freedom from pride or arrogance. God’s view of pride and humility clearly stated in 2 Samuel 22:28; Psalm 138:6. (1) In Bible times, how did Israel’s King Uzziah show himself to be a proud person, and what was the outcome? (2 Chron. 26:15-21); (2) How did Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon show himself filled with pride, and what was the result? (Dan. 4:29-33); (3) What did Nebuchadnezzar come to appreciate? (Dan. 4:37); (4) On the other hand, why did an angel of Jehovah call Daniel, the prophet, a “very desirable man”? (Dan. 10:11, 12); (5) How did the Lord Jesus Christ show himself to be truly an outstanding example of humility? (Phil. 2:5-8); (6) How will his humility further be shown at the end of his rule of a thousand years? (1 Cor. 15:28). [Cover the above in 15 min.—Another elder can discuss the balance of this part in 15 min.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Discuss the following situations and what pride or humility might do for such persons. (The comments in brackets are given to stimulate thinking.) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reproved for wrongdoing:</span><span class="font12"> [One might stop association with congregation, keep on in wrong conduct, show arrogant spirit. Or, might keep in even closer association to prevent wrong conduct from occurring again, humble oneself, showing he is not arrogant. (Heb. 12: 11)] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Cannot get along with someone in the congregation:</span><span class="font12"> [Refuse to speak, or speak evilly of such to others, slander, backbite. Read and apply Colossians 3: 12-14, or consider the course Paul and Barnabas followed when problems arose between them. (Acts 15:36-40)] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Have difficulty accepting counsel regarding our children:</span><span class="font12"> [Go on defensive, become resentful, spiteful, refuse to listen to or apply counsel. Or, try to understand why counsel given, apply toward children, apply advice from God’s Word. (Ps. 119:18, 105, 130; Prov. 3:11, 12)] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Differences between husband and wife or parents and children:</span><span class="font12"> [Refuse to talk, husband exercises authority in demanding, unloving way, wife does spiteful things, refuses to cooperate willingly, mocks or belittles husband, children refuse to communicate, think parents old-fashioned. Or, apply wise counsel of Ephesians 4:26; 5:22-24, 28, 29; 6:1-4; James 1:19-21.] The lesson to be learned: “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”—Jas. 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Concluding comments. Get observations from audience as to practical application of the material just discussed. What did you learn? How might these points help to prepare us for the future? Song 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Song 71. Introduction and then talk based on special letter sent to congregations on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> of October 8, “A Sound Guide for Modern Living.” Select appropriate information designed to enthuse the brothers for using this magazine in the field. Take some highlights from the letter; also, tell how special issue will be used and by whom, including Bible students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">16 min: </span><span class="font12">Assemblies Enhance Our Appreciation for God’s Word. Chairman discusses 1975 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> p. 210, par. 3, to p. 233, par. 4, with panel of about six brothers and sisters, including some newer ones. Show how our appreciation for the Bible has been enhanced at notable assemblies through the years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The panel can be asked such questions as these: (1) During the 1950 Theocracy’s Increase Assembly, how was understanding clarified regarding the “princes”? (Pp. 213, 214) (2) The 1958 Divine Will International Assembly is memorable for what reasons? (Pp. 216-218) (3) How was the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> made available, and what have been notable features and effects of this Bible version? (Pp. 219, 220) (4) During the international assembly of 1953, what program was announced, and what improvement has resulted as far as our preaching work is concerned? (Pp. 227, 228) (5) At large assemblies since 1966, what new method has been used to impart Bible instruction and counsel? Has this means been effective? (Pp. 233, 234) What lessons were conveyed by the dramas at the district assemblies this past summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Emphasize in conclusion that assemblies provide needed instruction from God’s Word and help us to become better preachers of the good news. Hence, we do well to show our appreciation for God’s Word by reading and using it diligently and by assembling regularly with our fellow worshipers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Are You Discerning? Suggest some short demonstrations highlighting the matter of discerning the circumstances as we talk to people at the doors and elsewhere. Get comments on each situation. (1) Have publisher witnessing but oblivious to the fact that the householder just got out of bed, is not awake at all and is totally unreceptive to what the publisher is saying. But publisher just keeps on talking, not discerning. (2) Have a person very kindly say he is not interested today. Publisher thanks him and offers to return on another occasion. Does this show discernment? (3) Have irate individual definitely say he is NOT INTERESTED AT ALL. Publisher says rather boldly, “What aren’t you interested in? I haven’t even told you why I’m here.” Undiscerning publisher then proceeds on with presentation and householder walks away. Stress being discerning and flexible in preaching work, leave people in a pleasant mood as far as it depends on you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">22 min: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> presentation. “Take Notice of Him.” Are you wondering how best to present the subscription offer? If you are newly associated with Jehovah’s people and have not yet tried a one-scripture presentation, we recommend the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Hello, almost everyone I meet would like to have a sound guide for living in these modern times. The Bible offers such counsel in Proverbs 3:5, 6. [Read.] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> shows how to do this in a modern world and what real hope exists for the future.” If the householder is interested and seems willing to listen to more, you could read verses one and two of Proverbs, chapter three. If you discern that it would be best to bring matters to a conclusion, you could refer to the title of the special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and/or make brief comments from an article that would be appropriate. When describing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">subscription offer, you might want to say: “I’d be very happy to arrange for you to receive this outstanding magazine for just $1.50 a year. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">Is truly one of a kind, for other newsmagazines tell what’s happening today, but only </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> points to the remedy—God’s kingdom. I’m sure you would enjoy having it along with these three free booklets.” (If you would feel more comfortable going along with an experienced publisher, listening for a few times before trying this on your own, fine.) Get comments from audience regarding use of presentation, especially from newer publishers, if they feel moved to share in this type of work for first time. Concluding comments. Song 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font12">Song 70. Introduction and discussion between brother and publisher who wants to share in field service for the first time. Utilize points from “Question Box” stressing proper conduct and good appearance in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Hospitality—A Mark of True Christianity.” Questions and answers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">“Helping the New Publishers.” Animated discussion of points in article by two brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font12">Stress use of special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">magazine with Bible students, perhaps demonstrating how magazines could best be used by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font12">“What the Churches Do Not Tell You.” (6/15/75 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> pp. 355-358) Informative, lively talk by qualified elder, emphasizing key scriptures supporting true worship as relating to God and Christ, life after death, the Christian view of politics and a wicked system to end. Help publishers to see how to use points in local territory. Song 65.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Your Use of the “Man’s Salvation” Book</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13">What an outstanding thing it was when Jesus, in the Nazareth synagogue, read Isaiah 61:1, about Jehovah’s anointed one, and then said: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled”! —Luke 4:16-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For all men of faith since then, including us, that certainly was good news. Jesus is the Servant, the Anointed One, concerning whom many of the prophecies in the book of Isaiah deal. He is our means of salvation. That is news worthy of proclamation, and we are eagerly proclaiming it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How thrilled we were, then, to receive at the district assembly the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand! (si)</span><span class="font13"> It deals with many important portions of Isaiah’s prophecy that directly affect us. If you have already read in the new book, you have noted how full of good things it is. And likely you have already been talking with your brothers and others about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But soon we are going to be able to get better acquainted with its contents. During November we will have four special talks based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation</span><span class="font13"> book. That will be a fine preview in anticipation of our thorough study of the book beginning in December. Also, these talks, by familiarizing us with the fine things in the book, will aid us to offer it effectively in the field service during November.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Will You Do?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Perhaps you do not expect to deliver any of these talks. So are you at all involved? You definitely are!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you think about the two benefits just mentioned, you can see why. Since </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font13"> are going to be studying the book at the congregation book study starting in December, do you not want to have an idea of what the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation</span><span class="font13"> book has to say? It will be many months before you finish studying it. So the rapid preview in the talks will enable you to know what prophecies of Isaiah are explained in the book and what is the basic application of these prophecies. And there are some adjustments in viewpoint, some “new things,” in the book that you need to fix in mind. Also, when </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font13"> offer the new book in the field service in November, you will definitely want to know its contents, will you not? Hence, there is no question that these four talks are important for you. How, though, can you best benefit from them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Undoubtedly the most helpful thing will be to read the material to be covered in the upcoming talk each week. True, that is quite a lot of material, about five chapters a week, and you already do have a full schedule. But before dismissing that possibility, consider this: Reading the chapters will be different from preparing your lesson for the book study. In this case you need not read the questions and determine the answers. Rather, you can read straight through the chapters, moving along rapidly. Doing this will certainly add to your benefit from the talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">‘What if I can’t do that?’ you may ask. You know your own situation. But here is another possibility. If you simply cannot read the chapters each week, can you “skim” the material? In just thirty minutes or so each week you can quickly go through the respective chapters and get an idea of their basic contents. For each chapter do this: First read the opening paragraph or two, or even the first page of the chapter. Then for the remainder of the chapter read only the first sentence of each paragraph, also noting any subheadings along the way. This will give you a quick view of the chapter. No, you will not have all the details, but doing just this much will help to make the talks more meaningful for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Finally, each week bring your copy of the book with you to the public talk. The speaker will be referring you to it. He may even have certain portions read aloud by persons in the audience. You will become even better acquainted with the book’s contents by following along in it each week. That is a blessing we are all looking forward to, thankful to Jehovah for this spiritual food.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Speakers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">In most cases there will likely be sufficient speakers (elders and capable ministerial servants) in one congregation to deliver all four talks. However, if two congregations need to exchange speakers, that can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is no objection to having two speakers for one talk, dividing up the assigned material. The nature of the material in these talks allows for that. (Here are possible divisions of the material: Talk No. 1—a. [Chaps. 1-3], b. [Chaps. 4, 5]; Talk No. 2—a. [Chaps. 6-8], b. [Chaps. 9-11]; Talk No. 3—a. [Chaps. 12, 13], b. [Chaps. 14, 15]; Talk No. 4—a. [Chaps. 16, 17], b. [Chaps. 18, 19]) If it is decided that two brothers will share in delivering a talk, they should consult together so that they both understand clearly the division of the material and the time. They can also consider how the first speaker will lead into or introduce the second part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To cover in a balanced and reasonable manner eighty or more pages of the book, you will not be able to deal with every detail. The following outlines should help you. Please study carefully the outline assigned to you. Note that some pages are considered, and others are intentionally skipped. This will enable you to focus on some of the highlights and new points, not losing the audience in a deluge of hurried details. Concentrate on the scriptures here listed, either reading them yourself or having persons in the audience read them aloud for you. That will help all to be better acquainted with and to understand God’s Word, which is what we all very much desire, is it not?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font19">KINGDOM MINISTRY, SEPTEMBER 1975</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">You are lovingly interested in your brothers and sisters; that is why you assigned speakers are giving of yourselves to prepare and deliver one of these talks. Something that will add to your effectiveness in helping your brothers is your calling attention to and reading specific paragraphs of the book as you progress. In’ each outline we have called attention to key paragraphs, marked </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“note,”</span><span class="font13"> which you likely will want to read (or have read) in whole or in part. True, this may take more effort in your preparation and delivery. But the good results obtained from the effort make it well worth it. (Compare Acts 20:19-21.) And instead of referring to some page or paragraph in the book merely once or twice, try to do it throughout the talk. Thus the brothers in the audience can actually follow along; they will be using the book, looking at it, seeing for themselves the good things it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If at all possible, these four talks should be presented during November, as was announced in the August </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> As soon as the local details have been finalized, handbills may be ordered. Then, the week before each talk the congregation should be informed of the talk for the coming week. Urge them to prepare and to bring their books. Also, they can be encouraged to invite newly interested persons to attend—especially persons who have a copy of the new book and who would like to learn of its contents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">1. Relief from World Distress Through Whom? (sZ chapters 1-5)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">This generation has faced distress, but has reason for hope.</span><span class="font13"> (10 min.; chaps. 1, 2) Everyone is interested in future. Many seek information about it from political analysts, fortune-tellers. No man alive is capable of predicting future. Many who are concerned about future know that trouble has marked this generation since turning point in 1914. (Pp. 8-13) Not reasonable for them to turn for guidance to religions that they have abandoned. (Prov. 26:11) One person who proved he can foretell world events also spoke of our time. He showed himself a reliable commentator by predicting destruction of Jewish system. Has significance for our time, too. (Pp. 15, 17-19, 22, 23, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> H17, 18; Matt. 24:3, 21; Luke 21: 24) This one is Jesus. He proved himself Messiah, and reliable evidence shows he was resurrected. (Pp. 25-29) What can we learn about him that gives us reason for hope as to relief from world distress?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Can rest our hope on Jesus Christ, for he has God’s backing.</span><span class="font13"> (15 min.; chap. 3) He is not mere babe that sentimental persons adore; neither a shameful criminal. (Pp. 42, 43) Should not view him as did rulers in first century, and as rulers do today. (P. 30) He has been transformed, elevated and given authority. Isaiah 52:13-53:12 shows why we can look to him with confidence and have hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Bible identifies him as Servant of Isaiah 52:13. (Relate Acts 8:26-40; p. 37, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> fil7.) He was elevated to God’s right hand to await time to exercise rulership. (Acts 2:34-36; pp. 38-41) This contrasts with widespread image of him as ‘disfigured’ lawbreaker undergoing execution. (Isa. 52: 14; p. 43) Even today most persons have not heard from clergy facts as to how “Servant” will war against nations; only Witnesses urge people to have affection for him as enthroned ruler. (Isa. 52:15; pp. 44, 45; discuss with audience picture, p. 40.) Are you sharing in that? Do you know why we can have confidence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">We can have confidence because of his integrity. </span><span class="font13">(15 min.; chap. 4) Who will have confidence, faith in him? (Isa. 53:1; pp. 46, 48) He had to be born on earth. Had humble beginning, and religious leaders viewed him as unattractive. (Isa. 53:2; pp. 48-51) Opposers refused to esteem him, though he healed many and stressed spiritual curing. (Isa. 53:3; John 7:48, 49; pp. 52-54) But why would God allow him to be disgraced? Understanding this should affect our hope for relief. Allowed it so Son could prove that Satan’s challenge, presented in Job’s case, was false. Let Son provide full vindication of Father as rightful Sovereign. (Pp. 58-63, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> T[37) That Father had such confidence in Son should build our confidence in him and our hope for future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Build solid hope on integrity God’s Son showed. </span><span class="font13">(15 min.; chap. 5) We can be thankful that Son was willing to be scapegoat, suffering death for others. (Isa. 53:4, 5; pp. 64, 66) His interest in aiding imperfect humans is seen in healings he performed; should stimulate our hope as to what he can yet do for those with faith. (P. 67) His endurance of persecution worked for our good. (P. 68, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> filO) Jesus -did not fight against dying like a sacrificial lamb. (Isa. 53:6, 7; p. 70) By not restraining enemies, God allowed Son to be impaled with wicked, killed and buried. (Isa. 53:8, 9; pp. 71, 76, 77) While permitting Son to be crushed, God delighted in his integrity. (Isa. 53:10, 11; p. 78, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note </span><span class="font13">Y35) Puts Son in position to be our “Eternal Father,” for he will bring many to righteous standing. (Pp. 80, 82) He was faithful, as were men such as Noah and Job. (Isa. 53:12; p. 83) Are you grateful that Jesus carried sins of many? Do you appreciate God’s mercy and love that moved him to let Son serve as ransom? Should convince us that Jesus is the one through whom relief from distress will come, and move us to respond appreciatively. —Titus 3:4-6; pp. 88, 89.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">2. Choose to Live in Paradise Now and Forever (sZ chapters 6-11)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">We can live in paradise—it is not just a dream. </span><span class="font13">(15 min.; chap. 6) Widespread pollution stimulates our desire for life in a paradise. Greedy men will never turn earth into paradise; are doing the opposite. (P. 130) Many of us have found appealing</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">descriptions such as Isaiah 35:5, 6; 11:6-9. (Gist) How do such prophecies apply? When? To whom? What bearing do they have on our enjoying paradise now? In future? Ought to understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We have key in “paradise” Paul saw. Was a spiritual paradise having a type in ancient Israel. (2 Cor. 12:1-5; pp. 131-133, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 06, 9) As aid to understanding Isaiah 35, we will consider chapter 55. Had an application involving Jews in exile until 537 B.C.E. God gave message of liberation. (Isa. 55:1, 2; p. 96, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 1(16) For spiritual Israel captive in Babylon the Great, this also was message of deliverance. (Pp. 97-100; John 8:32) Sustained life centered on Jesus, heir of David. (Isa. 55:3, 4; pp. 105-107) Many people, as if a nation who had not known God, could take up true worship; has occurred. (Isa. 55:5; pp. 108, 110) But what is required of us if we want to enjoy paradise now and forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Can now enjoy spiritual paradise if we meet God’s requirements.</span><span class="font13"> (15 min.; chaps. 7, 8) Must come to Jehovah, leaving any wickedness. (Isa. 55:6, 7; Prov. 21:27; pp. Ill, 114) God is willing to forgive; we can depend on his word. (Isa. 55:8-11; pp. 115-117) With ancient Israel, release and forgiveness led to recovery, paradise. (Isa. 55:12, 13; pp. 120-123) Spiritual Israelites had corresponding experience. (Pp. 126-129, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 039, 40) Are we striving to meet requirements so we can enjoy paradise now and forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How have you understood and explained Isaiah chapter 35? Parallel between return of Israel from Babylon and release of spiritual Israelites should help us see that the major, final and complete fulfillment of these restoration prophecies applies to the spiritual paradise. We are not saying there will be no literal corresponding developments like this in New Order; description matches conditions that existed in Eden, so we can expect similar conditions in New Order. But ought not view such future developments as the major or final application of Isaiah 35. (P. 139, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> ^23) God showered blessings on returned Israelites in miniature fulfillment and, later on, released spiritual Israel. (Isa. 35:1, 2; pp. 138-140) As it were, had eyes opened, ears unstopped, lameness removed, tongues freed to praise Jehovah; waters of life flowed forth. (Isa. 35:5-7; pp. 149-152) But how are you involved? Does this have direct effect on your outlook, personality, prospect for future? Study Isaiah’s prophecy further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Spiritual paradise is for clean persons.</span><span class="font13"> (10 min.; chap. 9) God made a way back to PromisedLand for Jews who were clean of religious contamination. They were safe from animals and beastlike men. (Isa. 35:8, 9; pp. 154-157) Those heading to spiritual paradise also must be clean. Would not be terrorized by men or organizations. (Pp. 158, 159, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 014, 15) In both fulfillments release, return and resumption of pure worship were causes for rejoicing. (Isa. 35:10; pp. 162-167, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 02) Effort to qualify for spiritual paradise now rewarded with joy and prospect of paradise forever.</span></p>

Ruler and inhabitants need personalities influenced by holy spirit. (Pp. 169, 170) Isaiah chapter 11 shows this. Jesus is the ruler. (Isa. 11:1, 2; pp. 173-176) We can look to him as Judge who delivers the oppressed. (Isa. 11: 3-5; pp. 179-182) Subjects want to imitate him. Isaiah 11:6-8 depicts this transformation of personalities.

(Isa. 11:10; pp. 197, 201) Very existence of spiritual paradise now, accompanied by transforming of animalistic dispositions of people, should reassure us of certainty of corresponding peaceful conditions, even among animals, in New Order.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">For future to be bright, major changes are needed. </span><span class="font13">(20 min.; chap. 12) People are pessimistic about future, seeing that things are getting worse. No real solutions to international conflicts and population explosion are in sight from human sources. Still, Bible proves your future can be bright. For future to be bright, changes are needed. As wretched slum must be cleared away for something better to be built, so entire corrupt human system will be replaced, including false religion and bad governments. In order for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font13"> future to be bright, you need to understand and cooperate with what God will do. —Dan. 4:35; 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">False religion is particularly reprehensible for misleading people. What is Creator’s view of Christendom and Judaism, which claim to represent him? Matthew 13:31, 32 illustrates Christendom’s growth as counterfeit of Kingdom, misleading millions. Context helps us to see application. In other illustrations concerning “the kingdom of the heavens,” Jesus identified “the weeds” as “the sons of the wicked one,” sown by the Devil, and “the birds” as agents of Satan. (Matt. 13:25, 38, 4, 19; Mark 4: 15; pp. 207-209) Christendom is a fake “kingdom of the heavens” and is full of badness, as next parable indicates. (Matt. 13:33) “Leaven” is used in the Bible to represent a corrupting agent. (Pp. 209-211, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> Ijll; 1 Cor. 5:6-8) Corresponds to foretold apostatizing of Christianity that led to founding of Christendom, which to this day is corrupt.

(Rev. 17:1, 2, 5, 6; pp. 234, 235) Babylon the Great has ridden on international peace organization. (Rev. 17:3, 8, 11; pp. 237-239) This organization will turn on false religion. How? When? How is your future involved?—Rev. 17:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bright future includes coming “great tribulation.” </span><span class="font13">(15 min.; chap. 14) In view of its long history and power, how could false religion be destroyed in future?

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Realize what is occurring and act accordingly. </span><span class="font13">(25 min.; chap. 16) Would be foolish to ignore facts that affect one’s life. Wisdom involves having and using' knowledge. Many persons refuse to recognize what is occurring and what God says will soon occur. We know from fulfillment of prophecy that we are in “last days.” But, as Peter foretold, many refuse to acknowledge this. (Luke 21:25, 26; 2 Pet. 3:1-4; pp. 283-285) They ignore Lord’s command to be on watch. Will we? Many churches mistakenly expect physical return of Jesus, but his presence is invisible.—P. 228, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 1fl4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Can learn lesson from Noah’s day. After mentioning our literal atmospheric heavens and our earth, Peter said that world of mankind of that time was destroyed. (2 Pet. 3:5, 6) Physical heavens and literal earth were not destroyed, nor were invisible spirit creatures. Wicked humans perished. (2 Pet. 2:5; pp. 290-292, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> H23) ‘By same word,’ decree of God guarantees another coming destruction. As with Flood, this will not be of literal planet and stars or atmosphere, but of ungodly humans. (2 Pet. 3:7; pp. 293, 294) “Earth” symbolizes human society, and “heavens” represent human governmental systems. (Pp. 296, 297) So even though Satan is a ruler of human governments, he is not included in “heavens” of 2 Peter 3:7 that are stored up for destruction of ungodly men. We can be grateful that God has been patient. (2 Pet. 3:8, 9; pp. 299-301, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> 1T43) On that day human governments will pass away and their constructed works will not escape.

(P. 321, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> |[19) In major fulfillment will have “new heavens” consisting of Jesus, who as a man on earth became permanent heir of Davidic Kingdom covenant, and 144,000 who are taken from earth actually to rule from heaven. (P. 323) New human society of true worshipers will turn our planet into global paradise. (Rev. 21:1-4; pp. 324-326) Before we can enjoy that, must make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">On whose side during coming climax of world distress?</span><span class="font13"> (10 min.; chap. 18) Knowing what is coming brings us to a decision. On whose side are we now and will we be in future? Are we striving now to be acceptable to Jehovah?

(Pp. 355, 356, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">note</span><span class="font13"> H13) Can then begin to turn earth into paradise.

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Hospitality—A Mark</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> All of us want to be hospitable, which really amounts to being cordial and generous in the receiving and entertaining of guests and strangers. Those who seek to qualify for appointment as elders should especially display this marvelous quality, which does so much to build warmth and togetherness in the congregation. (1 Tim. 3:1, 2; Titus 1:7, 8) However, each one of us should welcome strangers to the Christian meetings, showing equal interest in the lowly and in those well-to-do.—Rom. 12:13; Jas. 2:1-4, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What are some of the ways in which we can show hospitality? Since hospitality carries the thought of being “fond of strangers” </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">{Kingdom Interlinear),</span><span class="font13"> this should surely show up in the Kingdom Hall. Not only adults, but younger ones can introduce themselves to newcomers and welcome them. Do you go out of your way to greet people? Do you learn their names? This is especially necessary if we are conducting a meeting. Incidentally, whether you have official responsibilities in the congregation or not, when was the last time you invited someone to share the hospitality of your home? Many new ones have been cut off by their former friends and families because of the truth. Surely this vacuum needs to be filled. They need to be welcomed warmly into .our homes and hearts, thus making new friends and new family relationships.—Luke 18:29, 30; Jas. 2:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Displaying hospitality to everyone in the congregation is a big job, but if we spend a few minutes individually talking to even one person each week, we will soon begin to get acquainted with our</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">brothers and all of us will benefit from this hospitable interchange. If you are embarrassed because you have forgotten a person’s name, do not hesitate to inquire again. Sooner or later all of us will know one another’s name, and this is the way it should be, as in any family. In one congregation near Bethel, a newly interested person was brought to a meeting for the first time. One of the things that impressed her the most was that the conductor knew everybody by name, even little children. What a warm, family-like spirit this helped to generate!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Of course, hospitality is a two-way street. Not only should those already in the congregation show hospitality toward the new ones, but perhaps those of you who are new in the truth could take the initiative to invite some to your home from time to time. Elaborate preparations are not required, but conversation on spiritual matters will be upbuilding. (Luke 10:38-42; compare Acts 16: 15.) How vital hospitality is when we remember that only if we cultivate and maintain the spirit of love that prompts genuine expressions of hospitality can we gain God’s approval. This is so because love is the very foundation of true worship. Christ said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Clearly, warm, generous, open-hearted hospitality based on a deep love for Jehovah and our fellow humans is a mark of true Christianity.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Can you remember the first few times you associated with Jehovah’s people? Nowadays with so many new ones flocking to Jehovah’s organization we certainly rejoice and yet at the same time we want to ask ourselves, What can we do to help these many new ones learn all they can and, in turn, be useful in helping still other persons to follow Jehovah’s way?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Some new publishers have said they felt uneasy about answering questions at the book study because some of the brothers did not know their names. So if the publishers would learn the names of the new ones this would make it easier and more comfortable for the new ones to answer and seek counsel as such might be needed. Also, such simple things as filling out a field service report or a subscription slip, which come so easy to us who have been in the truth for a while, can be explained to the new publishers. The elder in charge of the Ministry School can approach newly associated ones and explain in detail the benefits of the school, making sure they get a schedule and learn about some useful tools for personal study, such as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired,” Sermon Outlines,</span><span class="font13"> and so forth. Many of the things we take for granted are things that new ones need help in learning.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For many of us June was the month for attending the “Divine Sovereignty” district assembly program, and what a delightful time we had! Also, it was good to see that the 510,947 who shared in publishing the good news placed 822,358 books and made over 3,000,000 return visits. This Is excellent indeed. Incidentally, from September through June, 7,359,773 books were placed in the field service, and as we all make more return visits and cultivate interest in the good news, surely this will result in opening the way for many more Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the Bible in Introducing Ourselves</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As you preach from house to house, what main impression would you like to leave? Would it not be that you are a disciple of Jesus, speaking from the Word of God? But for a person to be known as a disciple of Jesus Christ, it stands to reason that he must be equipped and ready to use the Bible in his preaching and teaching activity. Of course, to use the Bible effectively requires preparation, but surprisingly it is no more difficult than going to the doors and just making a brief magazine presentation. To illustrate: Have you ever thought of going to the door, Bible in hand, and saying something like the following?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> “Hello, I’m sharing a thought from the Bible on the promise of better times for the people. It is from the book of Revelation (21:4), which says of God: ‘He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.’ ” There you have a brief, but pointed introduction, and from the Bible you have read God’s words for the benefit of the householder. From there you may either pro</span><span class="font11">Helping New Publisher<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">1</a></sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">2</a></sup>&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">(Cont’d)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> New publishers can help us to assist them by getting acquainted with the elders, introducing themselves, even on more than one occasion, if necessary. If new ones would introduce themselves to the one conducting the meeting, taking the initiative in this, this would be helpful. Don’t hesitate to ask the older ones for assistance in connection with any of the services mentioned above. If some of the older ones are busy on a particular occasion, don’t take this as an evidence of their lack of concern for you, but seek them out again. This valuable interchange of encouragement will unite us together as a happy family, helping one another to progress in the truth and follow God’s way.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Presentation</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Ps. 37:9, 10—Soon wicked ones will be no more. ceed directly to what you have to offer, be it magazines, books or a Bible, or you can go into a more lengthy presentation if the householder permits. The main thing is that you are clearly representing yourself to the householder as a disciple of Jesus speaking from the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Here is another short introduction that you might find effective: “Good morning, I’m glad I found you at home, as I have a brief message for you from your Bible, which I know will bring you comfort in these times of distress. It is here in Proverbs 29:2.” Then read this brief scripture and either go on to make the offer or extend the sermon. It is not necessary to read a long Scripture verse. Often just a part of the verse—the part you wish to impress on the householder—is all that is needed, and then move on to the offer you have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> How refreshing this can be to those at the doors who will listen! And as you leave the door they will recall that a disciple of the Lord Jesus was at their home, preaching from the Word of God, the Bible. If you try it, we are sure that you will fully enjoy it.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">for those on the outside as shown by witnessing to them and by setting a godly example, but love also for those inside the Christian congregation. (1 Pet. 1:22; 4:8) Even if you are new in the truth, have you looked around the Kingdom Hall recently or at your book study group to see whom you can help? Who might need your love, your kindness, your encouragement? Who might need some comfort because of hard conditions at home or because of other problems that have come up recently? So, in addition to your attending meetings and participating in the field service, you can display this marvelous quality of love in many ways, including the attitude you display toward your neighbors and those with whom you may work at secular employment. This loving outlook on your part will give added evidence that you have chosen life by making it your determination to do things in God’s way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">. Good news from Turkey! The Turkish government, on May 21, 1975, approved the charter of a local religious corporation of Jehovah's witnesses. Under the provision of the charter, Jehovah’s witnesses are now being allowed to hold public meetings. Also, on November 29, 1974, the 20th District Court of Istanbul ruled that Jehovah's Christian witnesses are a religious body. According to that decision, each baptized Witness can now officially register his religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">' / Italy for the first time reports 50,506 publishers. Special pioneers now pass the 500 mark, and 97 percent of the country has been assigned to some congregation as territory to work regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A new land area has been opened for regular witnessing, since two special pioneers are now serving on St. Pierre and Miquelon, two small French islands about 10 miles south of Newfoundland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"> What effect do. our conduct and appearance have on those who view us as we share in the field service on the streets?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is evident that our conduct and dress have a bearing on our being effective representatives of the good news. Passersby are drawn to us if our appearance is fitting, our clothes clean and neat, our speech dignified and direct. At times publishers are seen steadily conversing with each other while engaged in the street work. It is good to remember, though, that we engage in this work, not to count time, but to help people. An elderly couple we know of, both over seventy years of age, have outstanding success in the field service, mostly in the street work, placing an average of 35 books and 165 magazines each month between them. What makes them so productive, even though they do not speak the English language well? It is their genuine sincerity coupled with their fine, clean appearance as they approach passersby. Month after month their joy is clearly manifest because of their happiness in giving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are some who are unable physically to approach people on the street, but these brothers and sisters, usually elderly ones, faithfully stick to their assignment and speak to those who come toward them, offering the latest copies of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> We commend our older brothers and sisters for their zealous work. But where physically able to do so, it is best to approach people. Do it in a dignified, friendly way. Avoid arguments and long conversations. Be kind, courteous and tactful. This, of course, applies in all facets of our activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Everyone is keenly interested in what happened in the United States during the 1975 service year. Well, we had a fine new peak of 560,879 publishers, with a monthly average of 534,765.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, one million fewer bound books were distributed this year, the total being 8,887,673. Another point: while a really marvelous witness was given and 92,925,486 hours were spent in giving the Kingdom proclamation, yet this was 6,725,000 fewer hours than the previous year, even though we had 28,398 more workers in the field each month. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is the answer: The monthly average of hours for the special pioneers was one hour less than for the year before. Regular pioneers also averaged one hour less, as did the temporary pioneers and the congregation publishers. That totals 6,417,000 fewer hours than for the previous year. Nevertheless, a truly remarkable witness was given. Maybe in 1976 all of us can pay a little more attention to budgeting our time. The apostle Paul said, ‘We must buy out the opportune time.’—Eph. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another thought-provoking point was the drop of 10,000 in the number of home Bible studies conducted weekly. Interestingly, there were also 10,000 fewer persons baptized. Bible study activity is something that we are going to try to improve by use of the three new study booklets during the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign. These will provide a good basis for return visits. So we hope and pray that the first four months of the 1976 calendar year will see a fine increase in this activity. A vital part of our work is to try to make disciples of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By the way, Brother Knorr recently visited five branches in Europe. He spoke to 3,075 in a packed-out new assembly hall in the Netherlands on September 19. Then, on the 23rd, he snared in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At our recent district assemblies one of the dramas reminded us that, in the days of Noah, Jehovah made it very clear when the opportunity for others to gain salvation in the ark had ended. It was not Noah who shut the door. After Noah and his family, along with specimens of the birds and animals, had gone into the ark at the appointed time, then, as the Bible says, “Jehovah shut the door behind him.”—Gen. 7:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What about our own day? Now it is the spiritual paradise that is the antitypical ark, Jehovah’s provision for survival. Though there was a time when the anointed class did not realize that there would be gathered into this place of safety a “great crowd” of persons with eternal life on earth in view, such an ingathering is now taking place. (Isa. 55:5) Right down to this time large numbers of such persons are gaining entry into the spiritual paradise. During just the past service year, right here in the United States, 71,300 persons were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah through Jesus Christ, the Greater Noah. Obviously, the door is still open!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How inappropriate it would be for any of us to endeavor in effect to pull that door shut prematurely by letting up in the preaching of the good news! God’s will is that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) The ingathering of recent months is an indication that there is work yet to be done. Blessings come to us when we harmonize our lives with God’s will. And we have opportunity to do that during November by offering in the field service a book that discusses at length the spiritual paradise and how to get into it. The book also points to the delightful prospects for the future that await persons who take the necessary steps now to be numbered among the survivors of the “great tribulation.” This is the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand!</span><span class="font11"> Let’s be enthusiastic about offering it to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Of course, we encourage interested ones to do more than simply peer into the spiritual paradise. True, it is delightful to read about it. It is refreshing to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall, associating with persons who produce the fruitage that is characteristic of that paradise. But to establish themselves as residents of that spiritual paradise, they must make a commitment, acknowledging, “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:10; see also verses 16, 17.) This involves dedication, publicly symbolized by water immersion. Have you made such a commitment? This is no time to put off making such a dedication to Jehovah God.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Once inside, we need to be sure that we stay there. This includes submitting ourselves to the King of the spiritual paradise, Jesus Christ, and working in genuine harmony with others dwelling there. Harmonizing our lives with. God’s purpose requires that we do this. (Eph. 1:9, 10; Ps. 133:1) Genuinely unselfish cooperation should mark all our dealings with one another. This is true, not only within our individual congregations, but in our relations with other congregations. This generous spirit should be evident in working out meeting times between congregations that share the same Kingdom Hall, in caring for expenses involved in maintaining the hall, yes, even in helping another congregation, whether personally or congregationally, to build a new Kingdom Hall that we may not personally use. Unlike the world, our concern should not be to seek advantage for ourselves, but to promote wholeheartedly the build-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, coL</span><span class="font11"> 3)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 3. Introduction, including discussion of the text from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">with comments from audience; emphasize what the text itself means, also how it affects our lives in a practical way. Discuss Branch Letter; encourage ordering the 1976 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">‘‘The Door Is Still Open!” Talk. Invite audience to read scriptures. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Will You Share in Preaching the Good News?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mention that the majority present doubtless share in preaching the good news to others. Some got started with distribution of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 21. Others have not yet participated; perhaps there are a few who used to share in field service regularly but who do so only rarely now. Some Scriptural thoughts will help all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(As you discuss this material and as time permits, invite audience to read and comment on scriptures.) Attending meetings is commendable: can indicate a desire for spiritual things; but not enough in Itself. Other people also need to learn about Jehovah and his purposes. (Rom. 10:13, 14) Jesus set the example for us; taught his followers to preach as he did. (1 Pet. 2:21; Luke 8:1) More required to please God than saying that we believe. (Jas. 2:18-26) Jesus is called the ‘‘faithful and true witness.” How does he feel about those who are indifferent about the work entrusted to his congregation? (Rev. 3:14-16) What is it that will motivate us to share in the preaching work that God has given his peoole to do? (Mark 6:34: Luke 10:25-28) What if we do not feel that we have the ability to do the work ? —1 Cor. 1:26, 27; 2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Explain that training will be provided for any who desire it. Urge them to ask for personal training from the one who studies with them or from their congregation book study conductor. Encourage them to continue to make progress, appreciate full significance of being a dedicated servant of God, not merely an outsider looking in, but one of the people in whom Jehovah takes pleasure. —Ps. 149:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Concluding comments. Accounts report. Include reminder of public talk on Sunday and what to do in preparation.

Be upbuilding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Good Communication. (Prov. 15:22) Open discussion with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">audience </span><span class="font10">analyzing importance and benefits of good communication among elders, ministerial servants and within Christian households. Chairman should use additional questions to be certain local needs highlighted. (w74, pp. 305-311, 313, 367 and 368; g 8/8/72, pp. 3 and 4) The elder handling this part will find it beneficial to get ideas as to needs of congregation from other elders in advance and should have in mind what he wants to develop. Communication among elders may be considered from viewpoint of those who may someday qualify, so that they appreciate before tnev become elders why it is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Within family circle, who needs to trate need for persistence in making return visits; to show good results from offering to study with friends, workmates, schoolmates; to show benefit of kindly offering to study with unbelieving family members or other relatives.) Ask audience why home Bible studies are important in our service. Stress joy that comes from conducting a study. (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) Include any needed Announcements. Song 82.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 2. News of Theocratic Interest. By describing events that would mark the time of his invisible presence, Jesus encouraged us to be alert to what takes place around us. Cite a few recent items from “Watching the World” or from “Insight on the News” that illustrate fulfillment of Matthew 24 or 2 Timothy 3:1-5. Connect items from Theocratic News with Matthew 24:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">How can communication between publishers and elders be improved? If some fearful of approaching elders, how can this be overcome? What things should publishers communicate to elders? (Things observed needing attention around Kingdom Hall or other matters that need to be cared for, such as matters regarding moral uncleanness, etc.) Why? What should elders tell congregation? (Not confidential matters, but progress of congregation, of the work locally, Kingdom Hall building or remodeling work, etc.) Why is communication necessary between elders; between elders and ministerial servants? (Prov. 13:10) What could result if communication is lacking between them, and what results where there is fine communication ? Chairman concludes, briefly encouraging all to communicate freely so there may be free flow of Jehovah’s spirit.—Matt. 18:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Your Share in Field Service.” Start with discussion of what local congregation is doing in field service: warmlv commend all for efforts put forth; if there are aspects that need attention, mention these.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When writing approvingly of those brothers who ‘reach out for an office of overseer,’ the apostle Paul reminded Timothy: ‘The overseer should be irreprehensible.’ (1 Tim. 3:1, 2) But it is not only of overseers that this is expected. In the same book of the Bible, other members of the congregation are also urged to be irreprehensible. (1 Tim. 5:7) Just what does being irreprehensible mean?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The point is that all of us need to appreciate that our conduct is not merely a personal matter. What we do reflects on our family, the congregation, and the name of God. We ought to conduct ourselves in a way that brings credit to Jehovah and to his people. Not only should we </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">speak</span><span class="font11"> about right conduct, but each individual should be “an example of fine works.” (Titus 2:6, 7) In spite of one’s doing that, some people may misconstrue what one does and find fault, as members of the Jewish congregation did with Jesus. (Luke 7:34, 35) But the idea in Paul’s admonition is that no </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">valid</span><span class="font11"> accusation can be made against the person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Of course, none of us are sinless. Under examination we can all be proved to have flaws; we all miss the mark. (1 John 1:8) But we should not be failing in any serious way to conform to the requirements of God’s Word, so that we would need to be reproved. (See Galations 5:19-21.) We ought to endeavor sincerely to apply Bible principles in all matters of life. Is that true of you? Is it true at home and with your relatives? Is it true at work, also in your recreation? Is your way of life such that others appreciate that yoU are an imitator of Christ? —Compare 1 Corinthians 11:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">O When ordering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1976 Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">publishers and pioneers are requested to do so through the congregation with which they are associated. Orders for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> in the following languages may be placed after the dates listed. December 1 — English. December 15 — French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish. January 20 — Dutch, </span><span class="font11">activities in which we engage, but also to the spirit that we show. Thus, when writing to the congregation at Philippi, including the overseers and ministerial servants, the apostle Paul emphasized the need for them to be imitators of Christ in this respect—“doing nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with lowliness of mind considering that the others are superior to you.”—Phil. 1:1; 2:1-8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> But what if a person does not do this? There are people who are so strong-minded that others frequently cannot reason with them. When such a person shares in a discussion he is contentious, giving others the clear impression that he is verbally fighting against his brothers. Because he thinks too highly of himself, he is inclined to hold the views of others in contempt. As a result, his remarks easily cause sharp divisions over the issues at hand instead of contributing to a meeting of minds. Of course, not everyone expresses himself in the same manner. Some are more forceful than others. But contentions and divisions are classed by God’s Word as “works of the flesh.” (Gal. 5:19, 20) Anyone who makes a practice of such things is not irreprehensible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In what is recorded at 1 Timothy 5:7, referred to earlier, Paul was saying that real Christians ought to be irreprehensible in the way they care for widows who are closely related to them. But, of course, the same high standard applies to every aspect of our lives, does it not? Despite what the world around us 'does, all of us should be blameless. How? By “keeping a tight grip on the word of life,” always advocating it by both our speech and our conduct. —Phil. 2:14-16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Is there an urgent need to share in field service today? Yes! The command to “make disciples” has more force now than at any other time since it was given near the beginning of the Common Era, because the Bible indicates that those who are destroyed at the approaching “great tribulation” will perish forever. (2 Thess. 1:9) So, whatever our circumstances or privileges in the congregation, we should all endeavor to share in helping others to come into the right relationship with Jehovah. —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To share effectively in field service, good planning is necessary. It is beneficial to set time aside to share regularly at convenient times each week, if at all possible. A good schedule allows you to accomplish much more and your regularity will be a source of encouragement to others who may work with you. If you normally share in field service only on weekdays, perhaps you can adjust things occasionally so you can benefit by working with one of the elders or others on a weekend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> While the elders in a congregation have much to do in the shepherding work, they are also to be “examples to the flock,” and that includes their taking the lead in the field service. (1 Pet. 5:3) So elders should endeavor to balance their shepherding with field activity, giving due consideration to each. Balance is required, since there may be a tendency for any one of us to select what seems to be easiest to do, rather than what is most in need of attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But how can elders take the lead in field activity without neglecting shepherding work? Some elders make appointments to work in field service with publishers who need encouragement and offer them counsel as they walk between doors, thereby combining the shepherding and house-to-house work very nicely. Others may alternate weekends between shepherding and field service or they may work with the group from house to house for an hour or so and then visit publishers. After working with a group in rural territory, an elder may leave them in a town or more populated </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">♦ The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation</span><span class="font10"> book (page 208, paragraph 8) and the October 1, 1975, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> present different explanations as to who is represented by the “man” that planted the mustard grain. (Matt. 13:31, 32) Which is correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the October 1, 1975, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">page 600, paragraph 22, we read: “Jesus Christ, with his prophetic foresight, could foreknow the outcome for the symbolic mustard grain that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font10"> planted </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">in the first century.”</span><span class="font10"> So Jesus is to be considered as the planter referred to in this parable. An adjustment is being made in the printing of all future copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation</span><span class="font10"> book to read in harmony with this viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reasoning followed by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is consistent with what is found at Isaiah 5:2 and Jeremiah 2:21. There, Jehovah God’s experience with Israel was that he had planted Israel as a “choice red vine,” but Israel turned out to be a nation of “wild grapes” or, as Jeremiah says, a ‘degenerate, foreign vine.’ The parable, then, would indicate that Jesus foresaw a parallel experience between what happened to Israel and that in connection with the “kingdom of the heavens” referred to in the illustration. Hence, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> presents the corrected understanding that Jesus indeed is the planter of the mustard grain in the first century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Our brothers in Malawi are now experiencing another Siberia, another Nazi concentration camp, another Roman arena. “Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, a staunch elder in Malawi’s Presbyterian Church of Central Africa,” as he was described in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font9"> magazine of December 8, 1972, has again shown his hatred for Jehovah’s witnesses. Why? Because these Christians refuse to carry political party cards, with Banda’s picture and signature on them. It is a showdown! Banda insists they be his followers; Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to stand uncompromisingly for God’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Witnesses from Malawi who were residing in Mozambique now have been driven out of that country because they refuse to shout ‘Viva Frelimo,’ in favor of the new dictator government there. Forced back into Malawi, about 4,800 of them fled to Zambia again. But on October 22, we learned, these brothers were repatriated to Malawi a second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So upward of 30,000 are now back in Malawi. They have been harassed and brutally persecuted. Hundreds have been stripped naked, severely beaten and have had itching beans rubbed into their wounds. Our sisters have been fiendishly raped. What atrocities!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The latest development: The police are rounding up Jehovah’s witnesses and putting them in detention camps. Another Siberia! Another Nazi concentration camp! Children are being separated from their mothers, the persecutors thinking that they can train them to be followers of a man rather than followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is information that should go to the world! We have not read anything about it in the newspapers of America as yet, but the December 8 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> will carry the whole story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What can you do? The elders in each congregation are requested </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Public Talks to Equip Us for Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Something is planned that will not only delight you but also no doubt surprise you.” So read </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> back in 1968 when announcing the district assemblies for that year. How thrilled we were to learn at these conventions about the six-month Bible study program with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font9">book! This has had a tremendous impact on the disciple-making work. Why, since the release of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book more than 1,300,000 persons from all nations have gotten baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In December, we can once again look forward to something new— the release of three booklets specifically designed for Bible study purposes. Each booklet has been prepared with one basic segment of society in mind. So that we can quickly become acquainted with the contents of these new publications, they will provide the basis for three public talks, starting the second week of December.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The first of these discourses will feature the subject “A Secure Future—How You Can Find It.” This talk will be directed mainly to people who believe the Bible but are disturbed about the growing uncertainty of life. It will show how security is possible both now and in the future, while at the same time discussing basic Bible teachings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> “There Is Much More to Life!” is the encouraging topic to be considered the following week. Many people today see life only from the standpoint of day-to-day living. They want to know where we come from, what the meaning of life is and what the future holds. This is true of many young people as well as others. The material for this talk comes to grips with their thinking and points the way to a meaningful life as an approved servant of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Concluding the series will be the discourse “Is There a God Who Cares?” This talk is directed to those who have doubts about God’s existence—persons who cannot understand how a God who cares could permit humans to experience untold grief and suffering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Not only will we benefit from hearing the special talks scheduled for December but so will many interested persons. Besides attending yourself, be sure to invite Bible students, acquaintances and relatives. If possible, arrange to accompany them to the Kingdom Hall. Hopefully they will attend all three talks. If for some reason they cannot do so, encourage them to come especially to the one that you feel would be most appropriate for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> At the conclusion of each discourse, the particular booklet on which it was based will be released. Perhaps some attending for the first time will be glad to have you study the material with them. All, of course, will benefit by having the booklet for reviewing points that they may have missed. While the talk is fresh in your mind, read the booklet. As you read, mark it for use in conducting home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Truly we have grand things to look forward to in December. May Jehovah bless our efforts to aid fellowmen to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth with the help of the new instruments that will soon be available to us.</span></p></li></ul>

(Heb. 3:6; 6:11; Rom. 5:2-5) (5) How does the “hope of salvation” benefit us? (2 Cor. 3:12: 1 Thess. 1:3; 5:8; 1 John 3:2, 3) Conclude with comments about how our hope should be motivating us. Even though we do not as yet possess the reward, our hope should sustain us when we are faced with trials and move us to share it with others at all opportunities.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font8">“Exercise Patience.” Discussion of James 5:7-20, with scriptures that provide the basis for the questions being read first. (1) Read verses 7, 8. (a) What lesson can we learn from the farmer? (b) What factors might cause us to become impatient? (Note verses 4-6.) (2) Read verse 9. If we are patient, what will we not be doing toward our brothers? Why? (3) Read verses 10, 11. (a) How can the example of Job and the Hebrew prophets encourage us? (b) What do we learn here about the way Jehovah dealt with Job, and how does this encourage us to be patient? (4) Read verse 12. If we are patiently waiting for Jehovah to bring an end to the world’s dishonesty, what should be true of our “Yes” and our “No”? Why? </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Aid,</span><span class="font8"> p. 1238, pars. 3, 4, 6) (5) Read verses 13-20. (a) What should we do if we are suffering from some evil—disappointment, poor health or the like? (b) The patient person has joy. What should his being in “good spirits” move him to do? (Note that “psalms” are praises to God.) (c) If a person becomes spiritually ill, perhaps because of falling to exercise patience, what should he do?

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min; </span><span class="font8">“The End of All Things Has Drawn Close.” Discussion of 1 Peter 4:7-19, with passages on which questions are based being read first. (When the apostle Peter wrote, he was referring to the approaching end of the Jewish system of things. Today we are fast approaching the end of the entire wicked system. So the admonition of Peter has timely meaning to us.) (1) Read verse 7. (a) If we are &quot;sound in mind,” what view will we have of material things, worldly pleasures and the like? How will this right view affect our field service? (b) Why is prayer essential in this time of the end? (2) Read verses 8, 9.

(a) What should never be the reason for our undergoing suffering? (b) Why is Peter’s counsel in this regard especially appropriate for us today? (c) To whom should we always look to strengthen us when we are experiencing difficulty? (d) What should we be doing when enduring trials? Conclude, urging all to live in expectation of the certain fulfillment of Jehovah's promise.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TO ALL BODBES OF ELDERS</span></h1>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">December 1, 1975</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Dear Brothers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are confident that this finds all of you ‘paying attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son? (Acts 20:28) These are serious times and our concern for our brothers and for their spiritual welfare calls for very thoughtful attention to their needs and interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We can be grateful that we do not face an impending apostasy, as was the case with Christian overseers in the apostle Paul’s day. (Acts 20:29, 30) We do, nevertheless, face trials and tests and dangers, and this is certainly not the time for relaxing our vigil on behalf of all the flock. Though enjoying a spiritual paradise, we should still have the same concern for our brothers, and particularly for the weak, that the apostle Paul expressed at 2 Corinthians 11:28, 29.—Rom. 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Showing such concern is a day-to-day matter. However, the occasions when the elders of a congregation meet together as a body are times when they can show particular concern for the welfare of the whole congregation. We would therefore like to share with you some suggestions with regard to meetings of elders and how these meetings can be profitable for all and for the prospering of God’s work on earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Elders’ Meeting During the Visit</span><br><br><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>of the Circuit Overseer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">This special meeting is usually scheduled as an extra elders’ meeting apart from the quarterly meetings, unless there seems to be good reason to combine the two. The current presiding overseer serves as the chairman, as at other elders’ meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In preparing for and conducting this meeting it is good to keep in mind that the circuit overseer’s visit represents a special opportunity. While he shares in the meeting as a visiting elder, his visit is with a purpose. The right attitude toward such ones is expressed at 3 John 5-8. Those ciders serving in the circuits have all received appointment through' the governing body to serve in that capacity and generally have much experience in God’s service. In receiving such visiting brothers, elders will, of course, keep in mind the apostle’s inspired counsel: “In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another take the lead.”—Rom. 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In view of this, the agenda for the meeting in which the circuit overseer will share should be developed around the needs of the congregation in which he could most likely be of help, providing practical suggestions and observations. He spends much time in such meetings in different congregations and that experience can prove beneficial; he may be able to provide helpful examples and things learned in other congregations. We should always be open to receive suggestions or fresh thoughts that may aid in forwarding God’s work both in the congregation and out in the field.—Compare Acts 13:15; see </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organization,</span><span class="font9"> p. 84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So, since the occasion is a special one, it merits added thought and preparation. It may be possible for the presiding overseer and the circuit overseer, early during the week of the visit, to discuss the agenda for the meeting. Of course, all the elders are invited to recommend points they feel that it would be good to include among matters to be discussed. Once an agenda is decided upon, the elders as a whole should be advised of it, so as to give some thought beforehand and to be prepared to contribute to the discussion. Of course, this does not mean that new points cannot be brought up at the meeting. The most good will come from this meeting if it is tailored for the visit of the circuit overseer and the matters on which he can best assist. Matters that do not merit immediate attention could be discussed by the elders on some other occasion. If the meeting of the elders with the circuit overseer can be scheduled toward the end of the week, after he has become acquainted personally with the conditions or “spirit” in the congregation, it may be more beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Philem. 25) But local circumstances will determine the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the meeting the circuit overseer should feel free to comment or ask questions along with the other elders. The congregational elders may also wish to ask him for his observations on points discussed. It would be good for part of the meeting time to be made available for his use, perhaps twenty or thirty minutes, during which time he could present information he sees as being needed. lie may find it good to review some of the matters discussed at the circuit assembly meeting of elders (conducted by the district overseer) and such a review could prove very beneficial.—2 Pet. 1:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Often the circuit overseer, as a visiting elder, can make objective observations on the spirit he notes in the congregation—to what extent the congregation is displaying peace and unity —and he should feel free to do so. He may be able to contribute something of a balancing effect while offering, from Scripture and from experience, suggestions as to how improvements might be made in shepherding the flock, teaching at meetings, providing better direction to the work, or aiding individuals in the field. Elders will appreciate anything constructive and beneficial that might be offered by the traveling overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may be that the elders have in mind certain brothers to recommend in the future as ministerial servants or elders. If the body of elders have some question about the qualification of any of these, they could benefit from the circuit overseer’s observations. Or, those elders serving on the judicial committee may have some questions regarding problems, either already handled or current, on which they would appreciate the circuit overseer’s viewpoint and Scriptural expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For further details on the elders’ meeting during the circuit overseer’s visit, consult the August 1974 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> article “ Elders’ Meeting During Circuit Overseer’s Visit,” and the May 1975 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> article “Get the Spiritual Benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Soon after the circuit overseer’s visit his report should be passed around to each of the elders to read. The various points made can be beneficial to the elders, the ministerial servants and the entire congregation. Also there may be useful information that can provide the basis for the special service meetings to be prepared locally as suggested from time to time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Quarterly Elders’ Meetings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In preparing for quarterly elders’ meetings, the elders would do well to think on the shepherding counsel found in the letters to Timothy and Titus and in such passages as Acts 20:17-35 and 1 Peter 5:1-11, having in mind their own congregation and their shepherding work therein. The times in which we now live make even more vital the application of this counsel. By paying more than the usual attention to it, the elders may be aided to see more clearly what vital aspects of their service to their brothers merit consideration. (Heb. 2:1) As an example, consider the following points, any two or three of which might provide the basis for a spiritual, meaningful and practical discussion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The elders may consider </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the overall spirit of the congregation,</span><span class="font9"> to what extent it is displaying the fruitage of God’s spirit. (Compare Galatians 5:22, 23; 6:18; Philippians 4:23; Philemon 25; 1 Thessalonians 5:23.) Is real love manifested by a spirit of genuine warmth among the brothers? Are the bonds of love fortified by good hospitality and friendliness, by freedom from class distinctions and by a spirit of helpfulness in cases of need? Could such be improved? How? Is there a joyful spirit in the congregation, producing a pleasant atmosphere, free from tension? At the same time, do the brothers take the truth seriously as a way of life, involving all their activity, not just meetings or field service? Practical suggestions may be considered dealing with the local situation.—1 Pet. 4:8-10; Acts 2:46; Jas. 2:1-4, 15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In each case, wherever some weakness is evident, the elders can consider what part they themselves play in the matter, whether they contribute by word or example to the weakness and what they can do to aid in improvement. Elders should “set the tone” for the application of true Christianity in the congregation. They should speak in the same voice as the Fine Shepherd, and not make their own “rules,” for this could be damaging to the joy of the congregation, producing unnecessary tension.—John 10:4, 5; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 2:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The elders may consider </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">how well acquainted they are with the flock</span><span class="font9"> so as to be able to deal with it in an understanding and encouraging way. Worsening conditions create many problems nowadays and many of our brothers need encouragement. How well do we know the condition of the flock? (Prov. 27:23) What of new ones associating? Are these becoming well known to the elders and vice versa? Is due consideration being given to the sick, the handicapped, those with unbelieving mates and the young people in the congregation? What can be done to help such ones in a practical yet kind and loving way? (Jas. 1:27; 1 Tim. 5:9, 10; Prov. 14:21; 28:27; 1 Thess. 5:14) In following Paul’s example at Acts 20:20, is there need for more home visitation, not in a critical or faultfinding way, but to encourage and to strengthen bonds of mutual confidence and appreciation?—Rom. 1: 11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Similarly, consideration should be given to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the congregation meetings</span><span class="font9"> and how these, particularly the service meeting, can be more beneficial and meaningful for the local congregation. Can the meetings be more practically developed to cover local needs and conditions? Is proper timing being given consideration so as to avoid creating problems for those in attendance? Are there certain public talk subjects that would be especially worth while to feature again, perhaps ‘tailoring’ them more directly to the needs of the local congregation? Are presentations from the platform sufficiently warm and encouraging? Do they show good balance and understanding of the brothers’ circumstances and difficulties? Are those commenting making real expressions of faith or is there much mechanical answering, as for example, reading comments without understanding the material, and so forth? Where problems exist,, what can be done to help make the meetings more spiritually enriching or to aid those in attendance to participate more freely or more constructively? Is there need for transportation assistance for some in attending meetings? Are there dangers involved for some in getting to meetings? How might these be helped? Is there need to consider a change in meeting times? A need for more book study groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">preaching and teaching work in the field,</span><span class="font9"> the field overseer, of course, should be giving this regular attention, endeavoring to see that arrangements are made that are really helpful for all who wish to share, both during the week and on weekends. He may wish to consider with the body certain points where their cooperation is particularly needed or where their suggestions would be appreciated. Elders can consider how they might better balance their shepherding responsibilities with their personal share in the spreading of the good news in the field. Are they examples to the flock in field service? (Phil. 3:17; 1 Pet. 5:3) What help is being given to new ones to make good progress in extending the word of life to others? Are they being helped to learn how to use the Bible in so doing? Are they being invited to accompany others in return-visit and Bible-study activity so that they can learn how to be effective teachers of Bible truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How can more be encouraged to share in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">temporary or regular pioneer activity?</span><span class="font9"> Are those now pioneering in position to help more to share in the service during the week or at times when the elders are not free to do so? How much encouragement are the elders giving to those now pioneering? Are you aware of any problems they may be having?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">How well are the people in the territory being reached</span><span class="font9"> and to what extent are the brothers extending the word of life, at every opportunity, to relatives, friends, acquaintances, workmates, as well as strangers, whom they meet in daily life? Are there foreign-language groups in the territory and can they be better cared for? The circuit overseer spends much time in the field service and he may have helpful suggestions to aid you on many of these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Moral cleanness</span><span class="font9"> in the congregation is another possible vital topic. The judicial committee may have knowledge of circumstances that the rest of the body of elders could be informed of, so as to know how best to cooperate in protecting the congregation’s spiritual health, as well as to aid individual members who are weak. (Information of a confidential nature should be kept that way and not passed on to others outside the body.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Certain trends may be evident that merit attention, perhaps due to their threatening an infiltration of worldliness, as in certain extremes in dress, entertainment and similar things. The need for a balanced viewpoint can be discussed. The elders should not try to ‘police’ the brothers’ private lives, but should allow the exercise of personal conscience. At the same time they should as loving shepherds be alert to see genuine dangers and cope with these. The way to deal with trends that seem to constitute a genuine danger is not by imposing rules or arbitrary prohibitions but rather by the “healthful teaching” that aids the brothers to be alert to the danger of going to extremes. Encourage a balanced attitude in all things, impressing the brothers with the benefits of safeguarding themselves and others from slipping into immoral practices, not becoming a cause for stumbling to others.—Rom. 14:19; 1 Cor. 8:9-13; 10:23, 24, 31-33; 1 Thess. 4:3-6; Titus 1:9; 2:1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paul’s instructions at 2 Timothy 2:2 apply to elders in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">aiding other males in the congregation to qualify for service responsibilities.</span><span class="font9"> How can such help be given to certain ones and how much is now being done with an eye to future development? “Reaching out” is not simply a matter of expressing a desire to serve in some such position, but is manifest in personal development of the fine qualities that make one helpful to others, serviceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ways in which the ministerial servants could be better utilized might be discussed, seeing that the abilities of each one are used to the extent possible, also aiding them to continue developing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are a number of articles that have appeared in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and other publications on subjects that relate directly to the work of overseers, and on others indirectly related, such as those on mercy, repentance and similar topics. Any of these could provide material for worthwhile discussion and could be beneficially reviewed and applied where appropriate and where time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Besides all these things, there are matters of a less directly spiritual nature that may call for attention, such as the need for better care and protection of the Kingdom Hall and property, or future literature needs and the problem of seeing that any old supplies of literature or magazines are put to use, perhaps giving better attention to some of the necessary congregation records or the meeting of certain financial obligations of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are therefore many, many points for possible discussion. The elders must necessarily be selective as to which ones they consider at any particular meeting, basing their selection on the current needs of their congregation. This will also help to avoid meetings that are unnecessarily long. Some of the above matters can be handled as a regular part of the elders’ activity as they serve from week to week. Other matters that could beneficially be handled by them as a body might be discussed briefly at times that will not interfere with their giving attention to the flock or their sharing personally in preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whatever is decided at these elders’ meetings that requires further action should be carried out as promptly as possible. Talking will accomplish little if it is not followed by action, and we should want to be “doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (Jas. 1:22-25; 1 John 3:18) Thus if certain matters fall, for example, under the responsibility of the field overseer or the Bible study overseer to handle, as outlined in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font9"> book, each will use his initiative to follow through. Some things, of course, require the united effort of all in the body, such as visiting brothers in their homes, improving the quality of meetings or taking the lead in the field. But there are other details that certain elders may be assigned by the body to look after. In such eases, it should be definitely understood who will see to it that the task is carried out. The presiding overseer will make it a point to keep informed on the progress being made and show concern that these matters are properly handled. In this way these meetings will result, not just in many words, but in real accomplishment for the good of all.—Prov. 15:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We appreciate the weighty responsibility that you brothers carry and pray that “your love may abound yet more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment; that you may make sure of the more important things,” as you serve the flock. Keep ever in mind the power of God’s Word and his spirit and, by your healthful teaching, let these, rather than some imposition of arbitrary rules, be the force motivating the flock to zealous action and righteous living. In this way all of you will “be filled with righteous fruit, which is through Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise.”—Phil. 1:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Stay alive to the needs of the flock and be alert to shepherd with discernment, understanding and kindness. When the circuit overseer visits, he may discern matters affecting the spirituality of the flock that have not been fully appreciated by the other elders; or he may be of valuable assistance in aiding the elders to get certain problems in clearer focus. We are sure that you elders will properly value and make good use of the kind assistance he may give, as one of the men that the Head, Christ Jesus, contributes to the congregation for its service and benefit.—Eph. 4:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Please be assured of our warm love and best wishes as you continue on loyally and faithfully caring for the flock of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> How thrilling it is to see thousands of new publishers joining us in the vital work of Kingdompreaching. All of these, though, need instruction to become effective proclaimers of the “good news.” Jesus Christ set the example for us in providing guidelines for the disciples. When sending out the seventy evangelizers, he said: “Wherever you enter into a house say first, &quot;May this house have peace.’ Also, wherever you enter into a city and they receive you, ... go on telling them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ ” —Luke 10:5, 8, 9.</span></p></li>

He will know how to explain his beliefs and to develop his argumentation. Then, as he works with experienced publishers, he will con</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Parents are usually in the best position to help their children. Part of the family study period could be devoted to training children to use the Bible. When discussing problems that come up at school, parents might ask children to show from the Bible the reason for their stand. The youngsters could also be assigned to work up a presentation on specific objections encountered in the territory. Whenever good field points come up during the course of the Bible study, parents could highlight these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Similarly, brothers conducting book studies have opportunities to help publishers in their group to make progress in handling God’s Word. They may want to discuss with the field overseer what he knows about those needing aid and what could be done in their behalf. If some, though associated with the congregation for a long time, are only presenting magazines in the field service, how might they be encouraged to expand their ability by using the Bible? Could they be helped to make up a presentation based on a scripture or two with which they are familiar? They might benefit from working in the field service with the conductor or another publisher who uses the Bible well. Occasionally, during the course of the book study, the conductor might briefly show how a particular scripture could be used in the field.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> What a blessing it is for people in the territory when the Scriptures are explained to them!

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Endangered “Sheep”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">iAs you look around the Kingdom Hall, can you think of some brothers and sisters whom you have not seen for quite a while? Do you know why they are not attending meetings or sharing in the field service? Perhaps they are burdened with serious family or health problems, or have hurt feelings due to some personality differences, or for some other reason are depressed and discouraged. Or, it may be that someone has moved into your area who at one time associated with Jehovah’s Christian witnesses but has attended no meetings in the new location.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What should our attitude be toward these brothers and sisters? It should be like that expressed in Jesus Christ’s illustration at Matthew 18:12, 13. The shepherd willingly left the flock to search diligently for the sheep that had strayed. Expressing Jehovah’s view of straying “sheep,” Jesus stated: “It is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.” (Matt. 18:14) Surely, then, we want to be in harmony with Jehovah, doing what we can to help straying “sheep” back into association with the congregation, the flock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In their weakened state, straying “sheep” are in need of assurances from us brothers and sisters who love them. A phone call or a visit prompted, not by a mere sense of duty, but because of really caring for them can do much to lift their spirits. Your simply telling them that they should go to meetings and share in the field service would not be particularly encouraging. In fact, it could be the cause of further discouragement. When speaking to them, be warm and friendly as you would be with fleshly relatives whom you deeply love. Above all, strive to be a good listener and show understanding. You might share with them an upbuilding experience, or invite them to your home for a meal and an afternoon or evening of upbuilding association. If you are able to get them to go with you to a meeting or accompany you in some service activity it can do much to build them up. In some way spend a little time with them. By being natural, expressing yourself from the heart, you will be showing that you care about them as beloved brothers or sisters.—1 Thess. 5:14, 15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">‘Being Ail Things to All People’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was keenly interested in helping his fellowmen to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. He did everything within his power to reach their hearts. “To the Jews I became as a Jew,” said Paul, “that I might gain Jews ... To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:20-22) Is this your desire when sharing in the field service? But how can you become “all things to people of all sorts”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> One way is by approaching them with a presentation of Scriptural information that will have real meaning to them. What might appeal to a Catholic or Protestant, for example, may be of no interest to an agnostic or atheist. Similarly, men, women and youths vary as to their fields of interest. So would it not be good to prepare ■to share Scriptural thoughts that would fit the people whom we will meet in the field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What might you say to a woman? After a greeting, perhaps you could state: “I would like to share with you a thought from the Bible about how one can enjoy a happy family life. Many parents today are very much concerned about their children. The way children act can affect a family’s happiness, isn’t that so? Notice what the Bible says about this. [Read Proverbs 23:24, 25.] Bible instruction can be of real help to children.” Then offer the Bible, along with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher, </span><span class="font9">for $1.25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When a man answers the door, you might say: “The reason I am calling is to share with you God’s promise of peace and security. We all are concerned about the security of our home and our job, are we not? Notice what kind of security the Bible promises.” (Read 2 Peter 3:13.) Thereafter the current offer could be presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> What about teen-agers? Do we take time to speak to them? Or do we always ask for the parents? Though their parents may not be interested, many youths are. One fourteen-year-old boy wrote to the Society requesting a visit from one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Among other things, he said: “After reviewing many of your publications, I would like to learn more about God’s Word. Realizing that my religion is part of Babylon the Great, I wish to get out from her.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> What might you say when a teen-ager comes to the door? Possibly something like this: “Hello, my name is . . . What’s yours? I am encouraging young folks like you to read about the grand future that the Bible promises for us.” (Read Revelation 21:4, 5.) Ask what his thoughts are about this promise, and conclude with the literature offer. You might encourage him to read chapter 46 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> It may be that you have found certain other Scriptural thoughts that work well in your territory. If so, continue using them and mention them to other publishers. The important thing is that we try to reach “people of all sorts,” doing so in the hope that some of them might be saved.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font8"> book, page 84, suggests that during the week of his visit all the congregation meetings will be held at their normal time. However, this is not a hard and fast rule. Page 103 show’s that the time of meetings is determined locally. If the elders want to take this matter up with the congregation and they wish to have a meeting earlier in the week, such as TuesdaV or Wednesday evening, instead of Thursday or Friday evening, there would be no objection to that, provided it does not conflict w’ith the schedule of other congregations that also use the same hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meetings should be held w’hen it is in the best interest of the congregation. It may be, in some places where only one or tw’O congregations are using a Kingdom Hall and where normally the service meeting would be on Thursday or Friday, that the congregation would want to move that meeting to Tuesday for the week of the circuit overseer’s visit. It has been reported that in some places, when there are meetings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it is difficult for those from divided families and some of the new’ly interested ones to attend all of them. Congregation elders can inform the circuit overseer if there will be any change from the usual meeting schedule so he will have opportunity to prepare for his parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The congregation’s meeting with the circuit overseer early in the week also has the advantage of allowing more to speak w’ith him personally and to arrange to go with him or his wife in the field service. It is always good to do w’hat brings the most benefit from the visit of the circuit overseer, so it is left to the local congregation to decide if it wishes to make any changes in the meeting times for this special week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meetings for field service are ordinarily arranged each day, Wednesday through Sunday, during the visit of the circuit overseer. So that the congregation benefits fully from his experience, it is usually found advantageous to have the circuit overseer preside at these meetings for field service.</span></p>

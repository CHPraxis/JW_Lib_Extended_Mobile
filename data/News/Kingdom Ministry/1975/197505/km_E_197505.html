<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Kingdom ^PuMiste/iS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">All of us who are enjoying a share in the evangelizing work are encouraged very much as we see how Jehovah is making everything grow. (1 Cor. 3:6) From our viewpoint here at Bethel, there has never been anything like it. Last year in the United States 81,588 persons were immersed; and this service year, to the end of February, 32,845 have been immersed already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Distribution of literature containing the good news keeps increasing. The Brooklyn Bethel family who work in producing the Bibles and other books are personally aware of the growth. During the 1973 service year we were privileged to make 28 million copies. In 1974 we made 45 million. Amazingly, during the first six months of the present service year we have made 30 million books, including Bibles, but still there are some publications out of stock. As of March 1 we had unfilled orders on hand at Brooklyn for 32 million more books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In trying to meet the demand for literature to use in the evangelizing work, the Bethel family at Brooklyn and Watchtower Farms was increased by about 400 members, so now there are over two thousand members in this family. New bindery equipment has been ordered that will double the production capacity, the bindery lines being increased from ten to twenty. A total of 85 new machines are being purchased this year for making books. Also five more rotary printing presses are on order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the new machinery comes in, there will be a real need for more single brothers to serve at Bethel and produce publications for the evangelizing work, so we extend an invitation to those who are in good health and willing to do this kind of service to write to Office .of the President, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201, requesting an application. The age requirement for these single brothers is</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Evangelize with the Welcome Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>The birth of Jesus was good news to God-fearing persons who heard about it, news worthy of being announced far and wide. (Luke 2:10) Jesus proved to be the long-awaited Messiah, and he gave more good news to pass on to others—the news of the Messianic kingdom that will bless all mankind.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Today the evangel we declare to all mankind tells of the Kingdom’s establishment. It is an exciting announcement. So all servants of Jehovah should have the evangelizing spirit! Are you taking advantage of your opportunities to be an evangelizer? Do you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">schedule</span><span class="font10"> time for field service? Are you striving to improve your ability and effectiveness as an evangelizer? Do you really cultivate interest and show a willingness to take on the responsibility of a Bible study? Truly, if we have the evangelizing spirit we will definitely schedule time to evangelize on a regular basis and we will constantly strive to improve in presenting the good news. We will that they were born in 1956 or prior thereto and are not over 35 years old. Are you one who can join our family and help to supply your brothers with needed things to do the evangelizing work? We hope to welcome many more into the Bethel family in the near future, for we have faith that Jehovah will continue to make the congregations grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here at Bethel we find the increase exciting and we appreciate the privilege of serving you who are in the congregations everywhere. We pray that you will continue to have Jehovah’s blessing and good success in evangelizing with the good news for all mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">12 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font8">Song 92. Introductory comments and points from Branch Letter. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font8">‘Advertise the King and the Kingdom.’ Have certain book study groups prepared to comment on these points. Discuss the importance of zealously proclaiming the “good news.’’ The 1975 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font8"> page 119, paragraph 2, to page 144, paragraph 2, will provide the basis for their comments. The publishers can center their conversation around the following questions: (1) What developments in 1919 proved that Jehovah wanted his people to be busy in advertising the King and his Kingdom? (Pp. 120-122) (2) How was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> used to spread the “good news”? (Pp. 123-125) During the period from 1919 to 1921 w’hat publications were used in bringing the Kingdom message to people’s homes? (Pp. 125-128) (3) In view of w’hat happenings in connection with printing operations can we say that the use of literature in the field has had divine backing? (Pp. 128-130) (4) How did the second Cedar Point assembly serve as a grand stimulus for increased activity in door-to-door preaching? (Pp. 131-135) (5) How have Jehovah’s servants on earth been involved in the fulfillment of thrilling apocalyptic prophecies? (Pp. 135-139) (6) How was the radio used to advertise the King and the Kingdom? (Pp. ISO-144) In concluding, emphasize that it is a marvelous privilege to share in the field service—a work being done under angelic direction. (Rev. 14:6, 7) This should certainly encourage us to continue zealously advertising the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font8">“Evangelize with the Welcome Good News.” A talk. Include any interesting experiences, especially in distributing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Song 62. Introductory comments based on Question Box. Two elders discuss and show how overseers must teach in a variety of ways. A good example of an overseer who teaches is the circuit overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Understand Deeper Things</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How grateful we are for spiritual food! Since learning the truth, we have enjoyed the primary doctrine about Christ, but as dedicated servants of God we need to cultivate an appetite for solid food if we are to continue to grow spiritually. (1 Cor. 2:10; Heb. 5: 14; 6:1; 2 Pet. 2:16) One provision for understanding deeper things is the congregation book study. Much of the material is more than elementary and requires effort on our part to dig into it to grasp the . meaning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> All of us in the truth in 1971 enjoyed studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Je-</span><span class="font8">30 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font8">“Get the Spiritual Benefits.” Discuss material with audience participation. Include following demonstration:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Family at home comments on announcement of circuit overseer’s visit. Very happy to learn of visit. Family head encourages all to review service activity to see how they could benefit. Son mentions his house-to-house work weak; hasn’t had much success recently, so has been making only return visits on Sundays. Could use help from circuit overseer on this. Daughter has no Bible study, would like to conduct one. Feels circuit overseer might help her on several calls possibly to start a study. Wife has been wanting to temporary pioneer and feels this would be a good time. Could work with circuit overseer and wife during week. Wonders how they could work it out. Father comments all could work together to help on meals and other chores. Could have light easy-to-prepare meal in evening rather than usual large dinner. Suggests they buy meat that could be used for several meals, making it quicker to prepare evening meal. All agree would be fine to work together and help so wife could temporary pioneer during visit. Father plans to work with circuit overseer on Saturday or Sunday. All agree visit should help them as a family to progress spiritually; looking forward to visit very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments. May mention how last visit by circuit overseer helped. Include comments on day’s text and brief report on congregation accounts. Song 36.</span></p>

But from 1972 through 1974 there were 654,985 who were baptized and became part of Jehovah’s organization. What a fine thing it will be for these many new brothers to study this book with us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In addition to attending regularly, it is recommended that we carefully prepare our lesson each week before going to the book study, with a view to participating in the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When you finish the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose”</span><span class="font10"> book you can look forward to studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book.

Also include discussion of pages 100 and 101 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font8"> book under the subheading “Congregation Book Study.” Show how congregation book study is valuable meeting that Jehovah has arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also include brief demonstration of publisher preparing for book study at home, speaking as one thinking aloud. First asks himself question at bottom of page, then repeats to be sure he understands it. Then he notes points in paragraph that would answer question and underlines key words as he notes them out loud. Observes Scripture reference not quoted, so takes Bible and looks up reference, reading it out loud. Then asks himself: “How does this apply to paragraph?” Immediately sees point ana comments on how it applies. [Publisher can do two paragraphs in this way if time permits.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chairman then encourages all to prepare in this way each week in order to participate, being sure they understand questions and looking up scriptures not quoted. Also parents should help children to prepare answers before coming to study. Conclude by encouraging all to attend book study every week to benefit from the deeper things Jehovah has for us to learn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font8">The Society is not arranging any convention tours. Those interested in details of assemblies overseas can write to the branch offices (not Brooklyn) for information. Branch office addresses appear in the back of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font8">It is important for congregations that are incorporated to make sure that, if it is required by the state authorities that annual reports be made, this is done to ensure the continued existence of the corporation. There may also be a requirement that an annual request be made through some report for continued tax exemption. Lack of being alert as to these matters may cost congregations, not only legal existence of the corporation, but also tax-exempt status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font8">There are still congregations unable to cover their assigned territory regularly. Also, in some areas congregations could be started with additional help from elders, ministerial servants and pioneers. We request that any whose circumstances would allow them to go elsewhere for a few weeks or on a permanent basis write the Society, supplying the information requested on page 135 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font8"> book. Please give your letter to the presiding overseer. He, along with the other committee members, will review it, and they will probably recommend that the branch office consider your availability. However, if anyone does not qualify, the service committee will kindly inform the applicant of the reasons why they cannot recommend him and they will not send the letter to the Society’s office. (Same basic arrangement as outlined for pioneers, per page 137 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font8"> book)</span></p>

There will be extensive handbill distribution in each assembly city for a few days prior to the assembly, so if you can arrive there early, you may share in this witness work.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Give a good witness by what you say and do. Allow everyone a chance to have a seat. Elderly ones long in the truth cannot always get there early to find a seat.

Seats not occupied when the program begins should be made available to any who may be standing up.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The circuit overseer is coining! When that announcement is made in your congregation it is something special. Everyone—elders and ministerial servants charged with responsibility in the congregation, all Kingdom publishers and the many new ones associated with the congregation—should begin to think of how this provision through Jehovah’s organizational arrangement can be of spiritual benefit personally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In the first century the Christian congregation and the traveling overseers looked forward to their opportunity to be together. (Rom. 1:11) Such a personal visit meant an opportunity to learn from an older brother in the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When the news reaches you that the circuit overseer is coming, it is a good time to think of your spiritual need. Is there something on which you would like to have spiritual help or counsel? In checking your service activity you may find that you have not been in the house-to-house work for several weeks. Is it because of some problem in making a presentation? Do you use the Bible in house-to-house service? The circuit overseer and his wife, if he is married, are doing this kind of work almost every day and have gained wonderful experience. So if you detect a need for improvement in your preaching work, plan on a definite time when you will be able to accompany one of the visitors in the field service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Are you making return visits? Are you having any difficulties in starting home Bible studies? Especially in the afternoons there are excellent openings for making return visits with the circuit overseer or his wife. You may even enjoy having the circuit overseer or his wife conduct your home Bible study on this visit. This may be just the help you need.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Some of the publishers have found it possible to plan on doing temporary pioneer service at the time of the visit of the circuit overseer, and thus they are able to share in field service on more than one occasion during the visit.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The circuit overseers are older brothers who have some spiritual good things to impart in the meetings. Plan well ahead of time, keeping the dates clear, to be sure these spiritual benefits at meetings will not be missed.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With the June Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Once again we have the pleasure of presenting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font10">to people in our territory. During June we will offer it with the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font10"> for a contribution of $1.25. Here are a few suggestions you may want to try if you feel they would work in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If highlighting the Bible, you could say, after first identifying yourself: “Life is a very precious thing, isn’t it? [Allow householder to answer.] Yes, we enjoy being alive even though we may have problems. And isn’t it true that the more knowledge we gain about life and handling life’s problems, the happier we are? The best source of counsel on how to cope with life’s problems is God. We have his word in the Bible. But do you realize that God’s Word shows that the right kind of knowledge not only helps us now, but even leads to everlasting life? Note Jesus’ words at John 17:3. [Read.] Also, Jesus illustrated the need for us to put spiritual knowledge ahead of material needs at Matthew 4:4. [Read.] Our purpose is to encourage everyone to get the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. It is found right here in God’s Word. [Show Bible.] We leave this mod-ern-English translation, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> along with this Bible study aid </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?,</span><span class="font10"> for a contribution of only $1.25.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> You may wish to highlight </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is?</span><span class="font10"> at some doors. It is easy to present and covers a variety of subjects. But here is a suggestion you could try, Get the Spiritual Benefits </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">outline of points to be considered should be prepared in advance for the elders’ meeting. If there are any problems to be overcome or things that the elders want to improve in the organization of the congregation or in the field, it will be a good time to raise these questions. Hence elders can wisely arrange time during the meeting for the circuit overseer to comment on points under consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Congregation elders may wish to mention to the circuit overseer after identifying yourself to the householder: “Have you ever longed for good health, even perfect health, that would never leave you? [Allow householder to answer.] With perfect health, life could be so much more enjoyable. And did you know that God,, at Revelation 21:1-4 in the Bible, promises us that the time will come when sickness and even death will vanish? [Briefly comment on verses 1-3 and lead into reading Revelation 21:4 if possible.] This is what people pray for when asking for God’s kingdom to come and his will to be done on earth. Wouldn’t you like to learn more about this wonderful promise? This new Bible study aid [show book] has an entire chapter with the title ‘An Earth Free from Sickness and Death.’ I am sure you will enjoy it. We leave it along with this modern-English Bible translation, both for only $1.25.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">&gt; Of course, you may find other ways to present the offer for June that are successful in your territory, and, if you do, then use them. Also keep in mind other Bibles to offer, such as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation, </span><span class="font10">Byington’s translation and the large-print edition of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> When you make a return visit you may wish to show your own copy to someone who is interested. Also, some have found people who may be satisfied with their own Bible but who are interested in Bible study aids such as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things,”</span><span class="font10"> the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture”</span><span class="font10"> book or even the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font10"> book. So any of these excellent publications could be used in connection with the June campaign, on the first day of his visit what they feel is needed in the way of help in their congregation. Thus the circuit overseer can take this into consideration in arranging his work during the week and may be able to aid some of those in the congregation who need it the most.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Question (Sox</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• What is meant by the expression “qualified to teach” as a qualification for elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Teaching is done in a number of ways. Some are skilled speakers, able to teach from the platform. Others stand out for their ability to exhort and counsel individually or with family groups. In either case, the elder must have a good knowledge of the Scriptures, “holding firmly to the faithful word as respects his art of teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the teaching that is healthful and to reprove those who contradict.” This means being able to explain prophecy, teach sound doctrine and point out what the Bible says about morality and living according to Bible principles.—1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Overseers also teach by example. Jesus set the example for overseers during his earthly ministry. As he made disciples, he took them with him, showing them how the teaching work is done. (Matt. 9:35-38) After teaching them how to teach, he put them on their own to go and preach the Kingdom message in many places. (Matt. 10:7, 11-14) So it is a part of the teaching work of overseers to go into the field with members of the congregation and teach them how the work is done. New ones need to learn how to use the Bible from house to house and the teaching methods employed on return visits and in home Bible studies. This takes time.—See also Acts 20:20, 27, 35; 1 Corinthians 4:16; 1 Peter 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The practical overseer sees his opportunities to teach while in field service. Perhaps while walking between houses with a publisher there will be moments for conversation when questions can be answered or problems solved. Pointers can be given on how to improve in presenting the good news. The overseer has much teaching to do.—2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We are again in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">campaign. Last year, according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font2"> around the world we obtained 2,387,904 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> People want the magazines. And with good reason—these are the best magazines in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our report for last year included about a half million more subscriptions than during the previous year, but it was not our best year. Back in 1971 the brothers world wide obtained 2,702,972 subscriptions. Now, for the next four months, January through April, we shall have a wonderful opportunity to offer to the people </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font2"> particularly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> because it is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign. However, many persons will want subscriptions for both magazines. People who do not subscribe should be offered two magazines on a contribution of ten cents. The insight as to the significance of current events and the hope for the future contained in these magazines is not available in any other periodicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During these four months our distribution of magazines should increase. Last year, around the world, we had our greatest distribution of magazines by the Kingdom publishers. During the whole year our brothers and sisters distributed 273,238,018 copies. What a marvelous witness was thus given!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are sure that, all of you are watching the growth in printing of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">magazines. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> printing per issue increased by over 700,000 last year; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font2"> by 900,-000. With regular printings of over 8,700,000 for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and 8,600,000 for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> these are two of the most widely read magazines of any kind in the world. Would it not be wonderful if, before 1975 passes, it became necessary for the Society, through all its printing facilities -world wide, to print 10 million copies of each issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We here at Bethel are delighted</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Sharing in a [Faith-building Work</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah does not hide the truth from those seeking it. Even ‘‘the heavens are declaring the glory of God,” as Psalm 19:1 says. The apostle Paul quoted from this psalm to illustrate the spread of “the word about Christ,” saying: “Into all the earth their sound went out, and to the extremities of the inhabited earth their utterances.” (Rom. 10:17, 18) Having come to put faith in “the word” ourselves, we are pleased to share, the good news with others.—John 14:1, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> We can do this by sharing in the thirty-seventh annual </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription campaign. When <sup>1 </sup>we consider that the truth is now I being proclaimed in 207 countries and islands of the world, and that | </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> itself is published ; in 79 languages, with an average printing each issue of 8,700,000 copies, we can see the tremendous scope of this work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> But we realize,‘ too, that just leaving copies of the magazines ' with the people, or even arranging for them to receive a subscription, is not necessarily going to build up their faith. Once the magazines are in the homes of the people they need to appreciate their value, take them out of their wrappers and read them. Will the life-giving truths the magazines contain really sink into the hearts of the people so they will grow in faith without further help? As Paul said, “Faith follows the thing heard.” (Rom. 10: 17) It helps if we can discuss with with the demands put on us for the printing of the magazines. The paper supply is now ample. Maybe the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign will start moving things even more rapidly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you as together we put forth an extraordinary effort to distribute these two fine magazines j during 1975. Be assured of our | warm love and good wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brothers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span><span class="font2"> j</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">them the material presented. We should be alert to aid those who desire to increase their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Many publishers concentrate on starting Bible studies with persons who receive one of the Society’s small books as a study aid, but with subscribers some are not sure just how to proceed when it comes to starting a Bible study. Is that the way you feel? During the four months of our current subscription campaign we should make continuing efforts to study with persons showing interest, using the material the person has, so their faith will be built up. How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> A two-pronged approach would be helpful. It is appropriate to try to start a study using one of the free booklets that we leave with each subscriber, such as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Good Neus”</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font2"> booklet, right on the first call. Additionally, it is good to call back on subscribers to see that they receive their subscriptions all right and to leave the new magazines. This gives us the opportunity to encourage them to read articles we feel may be of interest and also to renew our offer to help them to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>G</sup> Actually, we can try starting studies whether persons subscribe or not, if interest is shown. Just a few minutes are required to show them how to use our publications to study the Bible. Many appreciate simply being shown how to use their Bibles to find the answer to the question in one of the booklets on an interesting point and how the scriptures cited support it. If it does not seem appropriate to prolong the discussion, we may arrange to return at a time convenient. In this way we will be able to continue with the important work of making return visits and, especially, starting Bible studies while presenting the faith-building material in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazines to the people during this subscription campaign.</span></p>

I Am Making All Things New.’<sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10"> Explain that this is a Bible promise based on Revelation 21:5. If person is not familiar with how to locate this scripture in the Bible, hand him yours and tell him how to find it by means of the index in the Bible, letting him do it. Commend him when he finds it and explain that now he knows how to use the Bible to find important texts mentioned in the publications. Publisher continues, briefly calling attention to opening question of the booklet and showing that the answer is to be found in the paragraph. Chairman interrupts to explain that the study may be continued discussing the opening paragraphs of the booklet if the householder desires. Before leaving, the publisher should offer to return to continue the discussion, mentioning further points to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: “Not </span><span class="font10">on Bread Alone.” (Matt. 4:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman: We want to help children understand Bible, not just find answers to study material. Good to discuss key scriptures thoroughly to be sure all in family understand their meaning. When reading the Bible in connection with the Theocratic Ministry School program, take time to comment on the significance of what is read. At times it is beneficial to discuss questions or problems confronting the family or that may be raised in school. Some families find it interesting for the one taking the lead to take the opposite side of a question, raising arguments for the others to overcome Scripturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(12 min.) Interview several family heads on their arrangements for family study and how they prepare for the meetings. Consider (1) their study program, (2) how they try to add variety to the study arrangement to keep it interesting for younger members of the family, and (3) what they do to make the material meaningful and applicable to their family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1 min.) Chairman: The important thing in each case is to have a regular program for family study, one that is helpful to your family. Commend the brothers for the efforts they are making to help their families keep well-nourished spiritually.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 93. Introduction, discussion of the text and highlights of Branch Letter. This could be handled as a shepherding call, bringing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> to publisher who is unable to get to the meeting. Material should be covered in normal conversational way in effort to mention highlights that visitor has appreciated from the material, sharing thoughts with householder, not making it a point-by-point coverage of the material.</span></p>

Can read excerpts. Stress points likely to be beneficial to local congregation, but convey the story, not dwelling long on one idea. On pages cited, can emphasize: (1) Brother Russell’s action when his faith in the Bible was reestablished, and how God’s spirit enlightened early Bible students about Christ’s invisible presence, end of Gentile Times (pp. 34-37): (2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> has Jehovah’s backing and has upheld the ransom from the start (p. 38); (3) God’s people knew they should preach the good news and did so (pp. 39, 40); (4) Holy spirit prompted persons to act on the truth (pp. 41, 42); (5) God’s people put forth effort to attend Christian meetings and from these young and old benefited spiritually (pp. 43, 44); (6) Tract work was done industriously and tracts brought good results (pp. 45, 46); (7) Pilgrims displayed Christian qualities. and spiritual benefits resulted from their visits (pp. 48-51); (8) Society’s headquarters were transferred to expand the preaching work, and Bethel family received good spiritual care, as through morning Bible discussions (pp. 51-53).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a resume, review with congregation how same pattern of Christian activity applies to us: (1) God’s spirit still reveals truth and motivates people to act on it; (2) Faithfully preach the good news, as did the early Bible Students; (3) Attend Christian meetings regularly, for they benefit young and old spiritually; (4) Share in tract distribution and presenting the magazines, and we can expect fine results; (5) Take full advantage of circuit overseer’s visit and thus benefit as God’s people did when pilgrims visited; (6) Like the Bethel family, we can discuss daily Bible text, to our spiritual advantage.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">Encourage all in congregation, including many new ones, to think about progressing spiritually. Family heads and study conductors especially could consider how to help others. (Deut. 6:7) Some might want to offer to help others get to meetings regularly, to comment, to have a part in the Ministry School, or to share in the field service if they are ready for that, taking each step progressively, giving aid to those new in the truth or young in years.—Phil. 3:13.

Our stressing a theme helps I people to remember our message. Jeho-; vah’s witnesses emphasize the theme highlighted bv the Bible. (1) What does the Bible indicate that the theme of our preaching should be? How did Jesus emphasize it during his ministry? (Matt. 10:7; Luke 8:1; Matt. 6:9, 10) (2) How do the Scriptures show that the Kingdom is a heavenly government to rule over the earth? What do the Scriptures show as to the extent and duration of its rule? (Matt. 13:45, 47: Zech. 14:9; Dan. 7:13, 14) (3) Why is the Kingdom theme appropriate and timely today? (Matt. 24:14: Rev. 14:6) (4) How has Jesus already shown the power of his Kingdom rule? What will he yet do?

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> One of the outstanding features of the Mosaic law was its requirements regarding cleanliness. It set the nation of Israel apart as a people who, to worship their God properly, were to keep themselves physically and spiritually clean. (Ex. 30:17-21; Lev. 11:35, 36; 15: 1-11; Isa. 52:11) As long as the laws were faithfully observed, the clean condition brought honor to God and contributed to the healthiness of the nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Today, too, cleanliness is a mark of Jehovah’s people. Many an auditorium manager has remarked that his building was cleaner after Jehovah’s witnesses had an assembly there than ever before. But, while cleanliness identifies Jehovah’s people as a group, is it true of each one of us individually? Whether we are one of the many new ones associated with the congregation, whether we are young or old, our concern for neatness and cleanliness reflects our appreciation for Jehovah’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Let’s look first at our homes. We do not want them to detract from the grand message we bear, do we? It would really seem inconsistent on our part to preach to our neighbors about, our future work of transforming this earth into a global paradise park, if, for example, we had a yard with unmended fences where the weeds grew profusely and it was always</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">O Literature offer, January through April: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription, with three booklets, for §1.50, or subscriptions for both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">in semimonthly editions, with six booklets, for $3.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O On March 30 all congregations will schedule a special public talk on the subject “Who Is Jehovah, so that All Should Worship Him?” A manuscript will be sent to the congregations in advance, but speakers may outline that material and deliver the talk from an outline if they prefer. This talk may be given the following week if a circuit overseer’s visit or circuit assembly is scheduled for March 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O The Memorial for 1975 will be held on Thursday, March 27. after 6 p.m., standard time. Memorial invitations may be ordered in lots of 250 for 25c, 500 for 50c, or 1,000 for $1. Please remit with order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O After January 1, 1975, congregations may begin ordering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font10"> for 1974; 10c each. Orders will be charged to your congregation literature account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ A reminder: The law requires registration of all males within a 60-day period beginning 30 days before their eighteenth birthday. Draft cards should be carried until one reaches 26 years of age;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O Outlines for two special talks are being prepared for use by all congre-</span><span class="font2">filled with discarded tires, broken toys and other items. Or, if when a person enters our home he is met by disagreeable odors due to lack of cleanliness, or he views a generally disorderly condition, he may feel we do not fully respect God’s view on cleanliness. Money is not essential to being clean and orderly, but time and effort are.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> And what about the automobile that we use for field service? Is it reasonably clean inside and out? Do we periodically clean our car as we should our home so that its appearance does not reflect unfavorably on the importance of the Kingdom message?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Perhaps, too, it would not be amiss to give thought to ourselves and our clothing. Are we neat and clean, so that we are not offensive to others? Reasonable cleanliness and hygiene can be maintained by moderate but regular washing of ourselves and our clothing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> But what if there is a case where a publisher is careless, becoming very dirty as to clothing, person or home, so that it really brings reproach on Jehovah and the congregation? Perhaps it is a person who, because of old age, simply needs some loving assistance to care for such things. Or perhaps the person is not aware of how he appears to others. Elders can tactfully counsel such ones, being careful not to impose arbitrary</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">gations. The titles are “Why Look to God as Your Refuge?” and “Are You Really Making Jehovah Your Stronghold?” We suggest that you set aside dates for them on your schedule of public talks for either late in April or early in May.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Our Kingdom Halls are filled with newly interested people who have been invited to enjoy the spiritual feasts that are provided there. In most cases there is no reluctance about inviting an interested person to them, because they are so attractive and neat. It takes work, though, to keep them that way. As you look around your Kingdom Hall, are the walls, floor and chairs clean? Are rest rooms cleaned regularly? Can you say that you have contributed to this by helping out when it was your turn to share in the cleaning or refinishing of the Kingdom Hall? When we are in a building such as our ora home or the Kingdom Hall often, we may not be inclined to note that walls are smudged or the paint is peeling, but others coming in for the first time may note these things and wonder whether their hosts are really concerned about the place to which they have invited them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Without a word being spoken, we can do much to glorify God by maintaining a neat, clean personal appearance and by keeping our homes, cars and Kingdom Halls neat and clean, too. In this way we will give no cause for stumbling to those to whom we preach in the community. And our manner of life will serve as a living sermon that we are Jehovah’s dedicated people, thus contributing to his praise and honor.—2 Cor. 7:1.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparing for Effective Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Making return visits on persons who are righteously disposed can be a most enjoyable and productive part of our field service. Yet many brothers feel uncertain as to just how to proceed and what to say on these return calls. It is encouraging to know that, if we make the effort in planting and watering the seeds of truth, Jehovah will bless those efforts to aid the interested person to grow spiritually.—1 Cor. 3:6-9; Acts 16:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The time to start preparing for an effective return visit is while you are still on the initial call. Make an effort to remember the person’s name. Listen carefully to his comments to see what is of interest to him, if he is a religious person or not, what church he belongs to, what you discuss that seems to be of interest to him. Perhaps he remarks that he would like to see the earth become a paradise but does not see how it will ever take place. Or he may say that he will never live to see it happen. Such points give us a lead on how to approach the person the next time we call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> So take time, when the call is concluded and before you forget, to make a notation of the householder’s name and other points that you feel would be helpful to you when calling back. For example, what do you know about him or about his family? He may tell you that some member of the family is sick, or comment on some problem the family is facing. When you return, ask about the person’s health or the problem he mentioned. In this way you show your warm personal interest in him and his family, and he can see that your concern for his eternal welfare is genuine. This may help to open the door for a further discussion on a friendly basis. Similarly, if we can show how our message will be helpful or applicable to the householder, it may help him to appreciate its importance in his life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> There are some “dos” and “don’ts” about making return visits. When you make the return call it is not good, as a rule, to ask the householder if he remembers you, as this may embarrass him. It is usually better just to tell him who you are and that you have kept your promise to return. If you made an appointment for a time to call but did not find him home, there is no need to question him as to what happened, but simply let him know that you are glad to find him home again so you can resume your discussion. Similarly, it is usually not a good thing to ask the householder if he read the literature you left, as he may feel uncomfortable to say that he did not have time for it. Rather, it is a more positive approach to mention a point of interest and tell him that you would like to spend just a few minutes discussing the matter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Still the question arises, What should you say now? We can be thankful that the publications we have make it so easy to make return visits, usually with a view to starting a Bible study. You know which publication the householder has that would be appropriate for use in a demonstration study, so you may plan accordingly. You may say, “If you have just a moment, I would like to show you how we study the Bible and see what you think of it.” Invite him to get his book or booklet and the Bible and show him how easy it is to find answers to important questions right from the Bible itself by using the Society’s publications. Let the publications speak for themselves as you consider the question, find the answer, check the scripture and read the comment from the paragraph. In this way return visits are not difficult but most enjoyable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> For special questions we have the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font2"> booklet and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things,”</span><span class="font2"> which provide ready Scriptural answers to most questions that arise. Some publishers find it good simply to make a note of questions asked and tell the householder that they would like to do a little research on these points and then visit again to share the information they have found, thus making the return visit far more effective. All are encouraged to share in this most enjoyable work, so start planning now to make some return visits the next time you share in field service.—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">• Is your congregation getting the benefits that result from the sharing of service privileges with all capable, qualified brothers who are associated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Upon the shoulders of the elders falls the heavy responsibility of teaching. That is why they are generally the ones to whom such assignments as conducting the congregation book study and delivering public talks and instruction talks are given. However, this does not mean that capable ministerial servants could not handle some of these same responsibilities. The use of these brothers will depend upon the need for their services and their ability to teach. It is often very practical for elders to have the help of ministerial servants in such teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For example, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book on page 81 explains that it is advantageous to have elders conduct book studies because teaching is involved, perhaps even taking more than one study if circumstances permit. But it also states: “If more book study conductors are needed, the local body of elders may request certain ministerial servants who give evidence of teaching ability to serve as substitute conductors, until such time as an elder is available.” This provision helps to keep the elders from becoming so occupied with caring for several studies that they cannot give proper attention to other responsibilities and aspects of congregational needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Similarly, it is good not to overlook the possibility of getting help from capable brothers newly arrived in the congregation. Thus, if a brother who has been appointed as an elder or a ministerial servant elsewhere moves into another congregation, it is not always necessary to wait a number of months to get acquainted with him. Rather, the elders would do well promptly to dispatch a letter to the elders of the congregation that the brother came from to get their comments on his qualifications and their recommendations. If their recommendation is favorable and the elders of the congregation where he now associates are satisfied that he qualifies, a recommendation may be submitted to the governing body. In the meantime the local body of elders can determine how the brother can be used to assist the congregation.</span></p>

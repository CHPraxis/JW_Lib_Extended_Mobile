<p><span class="font11">The Bethel family is really having many blessings. Every morning at the breakfast table we have been reading from the new </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font11">and thoroughly enjoying it. Besides that, in connection with our family study on Monday evening, we are all having the privilege of benefiting from the study material provided for elders who attend the Kingdom Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Already work is under way here in preparation for the special activity in April. We have had a peek at the material for the special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> for April 8. It features the timely subject “The Answer to Mankind’s Problems.” And the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">will carry the special public talk that is to be given on March 30 on the subject “ ‘Who Is Jehovah,’ so that All Should Worship Him?” Both of these magazines are to be given wide distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special distribution is planned in connection with the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Many people with whom we conduct Bible studies will have heard the public talk and may wish they could share the information with others. The Society would like to make a gift of three free copies of that issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> to each individual or household with whom a Bible study is being conducted, with the encouragement for them to give those magazines to other persons who they believe will read them. You do not need to order these additional copies of the magazines for those with whom you conduct Bible studies; the Society will consign them. But be sure to order extra copies for your own use in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a pleasure for us here at Bethel to be working alongside you as we all continue to make advancement in our service to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our warm Christian love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A People on the Move</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Peak—554,257 Publishers!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s organization is on the move. This is evident in many ways: Its understanding of God’s Word grows brighter year by year. The way the congregations function has been brought into closer conformity with the Scriptures. And, as foretold in *he Bible, the rate of ingathering of new disciples has been tremendously accelerated; another new peak, 554,257 publishers, reported in the United States in November!—Isa. 60:17, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What about us as individuals? Are we moving ahead with the organization? It surely is what all of us want to do. (1 Tim. 4:15) If we are newly associated, this means reaching forward toward Christian maturity. “Maturity” comes from a Greek word that means full-grown, complete. It involves acceptance of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">full range of</span><span class="font11"> Christian truth. It means no longer holding back in any way with respect to pure worship. It also involves experience, that is, learning “to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) Those who are mature are not always asking someone else to make decisions that they should be making for themselves. (Gal. 6:5) But does this mean that a mature person has all the answers? No. A mature person continues to learn and to apply God’s Word. Thus maturity, instead of marking the end of progress, makes it easier to move ahead with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">From a spiritual point of view, are you on the move with your brothers and sisters throughout the earth? In many respects, no doubt, you are. But are there areas in your life needing further attention, such as personal study and commenting at meetings? What about the matter of making greater application of Jehovah’s Word in the day-to-day affairs of life? This is something that offers opportunities for progress for all of us, isn’t it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Can you also see evidence of progress in your personal field service? All who have continued to share in it over a period of time with reliance on Jehovah can see such advancement. But perhaps you discern that there are more forward steps that you personally could take. For example, do you actually use the Scriptures in your field service when appropriate? During the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign you will find helpful in this regard the prominently featured scripture in the first article of each issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If you are sharing in the house-to-house service, is there still room for advancement? Well, are you calling back to instruct those who, in some way, manifest interest in the good news? Rarely does anyone simply read a piece of literature that has been placed with him and, without any personal help, begin attending meetings and sharing in the field service. Rather, is it not necessary to return and regularly visit the individual to help him to progress to spiritual maturity? We encourage you, with full reliance on Jehovah, to share regularly in this work. Perhaps you are making return visits on your placements and expired-subscription slips. Do you also study with interested persons? This should be our goal. It is not difficult. More than anything else, it requires a willingness to be used by Jehovah in this manner, coupled with preparation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> When we think back on what our lives were before we learned the truth, we realize that, because we have responded to Jehovah’s loving encouragement, every one of us has certainly moved ahead. And we want to continue to do so, right on into his new order, now so near.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One or two publishers approach elder, saying that they want to help unbelieving relatives to learn the truth, but are not having much success. Elder suggests they get Ideas from audience, many of whom have had personal experience. (Cover the following points: in some cases present the problem in the form of a verv brief demonstration, and then ask for suggestions. Avoid making rules.) (1) When housewife becomes a Witness, what changes take place in the way she uses her time? Why might this cause resentment on part of husband? What can be done to keep mate from feeling left out? (Apply this alsq to situation when man accepts truth but not his wife.) (wTl pp. 204-208, 210) (2) If unbelieving husband does things that are unscrlptural, what might be the effect if wife scolded him. telling him that Jehovah does not approve of what he does? What might It be better to say when confronted with these situations? (w71 p. 207) (3) What suggestions do you nave as to how a believer might share the Bible's message with an unbelieving mate? (w71 pp. 208. 211) (4) What can young folks do to help unbelieving parents to appreciate the truth? (w71 p. 213; yl&gt;71 p. 277 J3) (5) If a widow or a divorcee has teenage children when she learns the truth and they do not want to give up worldly habits and go to meetings, what can she do? (In commenting on use of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font9">at home, mention briefly what text for today Is.) (w62 pp. 211. 212) (6) Perhaps you want to write a letter to an uncle or a cousin or someone else whom you have not seen for years to witness to him. What could you say?

<p><span class="font9">Concluding comments. Ask audience: What did you learn this evening? How do you plan to use It?

How can we strengthen our faith? What reason is there for faith that God will bless our efforts to obtain material necessities? Why do we have faith that God’s promises concerning the New Order will really be fulfilled? (See Aid, pp. 561. 562: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure,”</span><span class="font9"> pp. 184-189.

Is debating a preferred way to present the good news? (Pp. 54-56) (3) What spirit did Jehovah's people display during early conventions?

<p><span class="font9">Chairman asks audience for suggestions as to how It could be handled differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Father now proceeds, using Bible to instruct children's hearts. Has son read 1 Cor. 15:33 and explain. Asks why Jehovah gave principle. Do they know children who had difficulty due to bad associations? Children cite example. (Read together Genesis 34:1, 2.) Then father comments on 2 Timothy 2:22 and Jude 16. Father explains Jehovah’s commands for our good, a protection like a fence to keep harm away. Father builds appreciation for Jehovah’s loving care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman asks audience what may happen If parent reaches minds only and not hearts. When tempted, heart may lead in wrong course. (Jer. 17:9) But what happens If minds and hearts are unified when one Is tempted? There is little doubt that they will do Jehovah's will. To offer such specific Instruction requires preparation, using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aid </span><span class="font9">book.

Proceed with witness. Highlight benefits of marking scriptures under brief topics In Bible. 10 min: Using the Concordance In Your Bible Effectively. Chairman uses following texts or others he may select and has brothers try to find their location by using concordance in Bible. This can aid In finding them quickly. Chairman reads each text with audience, Isolates main word or words and together find It In concordance: Deut. 30:19 (Choose); Ps. 55:22 (Burden); Prov. 27:11 (Wise); Jonah 2:2 (Sheol; have audience look up “Hell” first): John 14:28 (Greater).</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Loving Concern for Unbelieving Relatives</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Among the 297,872 who were baptized last year, many were the relatives of persons who had earlier become Jehovah’s witnesses. There is no question about it, people usually listen much more readily to someone they know than to a stranger who comes to their door. Are we taking full advantage of that fact to help our relatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Who is there to consider? Certainly those in our own households; also parents and children who no longer live in the same house. And what about grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and others? Perhaps you recall that among Jesus’ apostles were three—the sons of Zebedee and the son of Alphaeus—who evidently were his cousins. Obviously he had witnessed to them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> But maybe you have tried to share the good news with your relatives and had little success. Similarly, Jesus’ brothers were &quot;not exercising faith in him” even three years after his baptism. (John 7:5) Yet Jesus did not quit trying to help them. Evidently it was to his half brother James that Jesus appeared even after his resurrection, and with good results. (1 Cor. 15:7; Jas. 1:1) Not everyone will respond favorably, to be sure. But is it possible that further efforts to aid certain ones of your relatives would bear good fruit?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There are many ways to go about it. Letters can be written; personal visits might be made. Making available the Society’s literature that discusses points of interest to them is beneficial.

<p><span class="font9">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to reaching a fine new peak In publishers during November, the grand total of 5.825 were baptized. This brings the total Immersed this service year to 15,000. Last year for the same period of time there were 14,025. Thus we are enjoying a 7-percent increase in the number baptized so far this service year. How thrilling it is for all of us to be having a share in Kingdom-preaching and the disciplemaking work!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Opportunities That Are Open</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> There is a fine spirit among Jehovah’s people, a willingness to serve. (Ps. 110:3) So it is not unusual to hear someone ask, What opportunities are there for me to enlarge my service to Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- There are many opportunities, involving every aspect of our Christian lives. We cannot cover them all here, but let’s briefly discuss the field service, which is a vital part of our worship. We all know that we are to serve Jehovah whole-souled, but, of course, we as souls differ one from the other. (Luke 10:25-27) Not all have the same health and strength; nor do all have the same family responsibilities. Nevertheless, a willing heart will move us to share as fully as our circumstances permit in preaching the good news to others. It is good to consider personally and prayerfully the opportunities that are open.</span></p>

Then, if you realize that this is an opportunity that can be yours, take hold of it, looking to Jehovah to bless your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Of course, some who wish that they could pioneer may not be able to do so. But could they set aside 30, 40 or 50 hours each month for field service? Then why not seize hold of the opportunity to share to that extent in the grand work that Jehovah has given us to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> Some have inquired about opportunities for special pioneer service. What does this involve? It is open to those who are already regular pioneers, ones who are able to move to any territory where they might be assigned. Much of the need is for brothers and married couples in the colder north-central states. They agree to devote 150 hours to the field service each month, and, since their work is to develop interest in seldom-worked territory, they need to be effective in conducting Bible studies. If you are in position to share in this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggested Presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You may use as a subject the title of the opening article in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Read the scripture prominently featured in that article.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Use of the Bible</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">’ One of the things that was so striking about the ministry of Jesus ana his apostles was their constant use of the Scriptures. (John 7:16; Acts 17:2) Wisely we too endeavor to copy this example. But, on a personal basis, are you able to use the Bible as effectively as you would like? Aside from personal or family study, how can we get better acquainted with the Bible?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One way is to use it more during our meetings. For example, during the public talk, do you personally look up the scriptures mentioned by the speaker? If you do, and read them as he does, they will make a more lasting impression on your mind. Also, if you do something to aid in locating again key scriptures that you believe will be helpful at a later time, you will improve your ability to make use of the Bible. You may find it helpful to make some notes on a slip of paper to keep in your Bible. Or, during the meeting you may want to circle a verse number or perhaps </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">neatly</span><span class="font11"> underline a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">key word </span><span class="font11">that conveys the basic idea of the scripture so you will be able to find it again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is not difficult to use the Bible when making return visits. You could begin your presentation by mentioning that you have an interesting point to bring to the householder’s attention and ask if he has his Bible handy. You may choose to read from the book you left with him, looking up the scriptures together even if quoted. Doing this initially will build confidence in the publication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thal Are Open </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Contfd')</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">service, you may make that known to your circuit overseer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Be realistic in your planning. In view of the world’s present economic situation, those who are special pioneers usually need savings on which they can draw or some manner of income that will not be very time-consuming, to supplement the modest monthly allowance of $50 (plus a maximum of $15 for travel), which is provided by the Society on request. Those who need to do regular secular work to support themselves may</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If the householder does not know how to find scriptures in his Bible, why not help him? Show him the alphabetical index of Bible books and the use of the bold-faced chapter numbers with smaller verse numbers. If the householder is reluctant to use the Bible, or other circumstances make it advisable, simply discuss the subject, paraphrasing the scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> But what can you do when the householder asks a question not answered by your presentation? If you reply by first asking how he feels about it, this will give you time to locate an appropriate scripture. Some publishers have a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font11"> fastened in the back of their Bible and refer to it when answering questions. If you do not have one, why not obtain a copy and see if it does not aid you as well. Certain questions usually arise more frequently than others. Preparation for these might include marking down, either in personal study or at a meeting, scriptures that you would like to use in answer. With each text, note clearly the subject involved. Some publishers do this in a notebook, on a slip of paper carried in the Bible or on the front or back endsheet of their Bible. If it will help you, you may want to do that with the following: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“God is not dead—2 Pet. 3:9”; “World conditions—2 Tim. 3:1-5”; “Sickness—Rev. 21:4,”</span><span class="font11"> etc. Then, whenever these topics come up, you will have a fitting scripture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It will not be difficult to make good use of your Bible in the eld service if you make good use of it at meetings and in your personal study.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">also volunteer to serve in these areas where there is specially great need, but they may decide that it would be better to do so as regular pioneers or as congregation publishers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> There is still preaching and disciple-making work to be done, and the time is limited. But the opportunities open are varied. What could be a greater privilege than serving as witnesses for the Sovereign of the universe and as publicity agents for his grand Messianic kingdom? Now is the time to take full advantage of the opportunities within your reach.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font9">’ To what extent may ministerial servants be assigned to care for parts on the platform In congregation meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are many things that they can be Invited to do. depending on local needs and their personal ability. Some who do well on the platform may be assigned as chairmen at public meetings. Any who are fluent readers, having good pronunciation and sense stress, may be Invited to read at the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. Ministerial servants may present appropriate portions on sendee meetings. Certain ones who have cultivated good ability as teachers from the platform may be asked to give instruction talks. Those who demonstrate notable teaching ability and who can hold the Interest of an audience for longer talks may be Invited to give public talks in their home congregation; and even In other congregations, if specific request is made for them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, one's being a ministerial servant does not automatically qualify one for these assignments. Much depends on the abilities that he has cultivated and the needs of the local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is beneficial to have a variety of brothers serve the congregation from the platform, where this is possible. But quality of Instruction should not be unduly sacrificed in doing so. Nevertheless, the fact is that many ministerial servants are line speakers and it would be appropriate to make good use of their abilities on the meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In like manner, when other publishers visit the home, in some cases it is better not to start preaching, but just to be friendly, to get acquainted. It may be possible to relate experiences without making the other person feel that he is being preached to. Of course, if questions are asked, answer them. Use discernment, and when you feel it is appropriate, whether on the first visit or later, offer to study regularly with the unbeliever.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Think about the possibilities. Discuss these with others. And pray for Jehovah’s direction as you seek to locate, among the relatives of those already in the congregation, others whose hearts will respond to the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

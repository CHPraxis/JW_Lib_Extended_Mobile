<p><span class="font10">There is a great amount of urgent work that needs to be done. Can you help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here at Brooklyn we have on hand orders for some 19 million bound books, and congregation orders for the publications released at the recent district assemblies have not yet even begun to arrive. To keep our brothers supplied with equipment for the vital ministry that they are performing, it is going to be necessary to have a second shift nights here at the factory during the months to come. But that is not all! There is much painting and other work that ought to be done at Bethel. Also, furniture and other items need to be made ] for the new residential and printing ; buildings that are under construc-' tion at Watchtower Earm. This is work that needs to be accomplished during the next twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Can you help out? I Joes your heart move you to say, “Here I am 1 Send me’’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We would like to bring in a hundred or more strong, single brothers, between 18 and 45 years of age, as temporary workers for one year. We need carpenters and painters, along with many to work in printing, in the book bindery and in mailing operations. It has been possible to obtain housing accommodations for one hundred additional workers, near or in Bethel and these will soon be ready for use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are you a single brother who is healthy and willing to work hard to advance Kingdom interests? Would yon like to share in this special work for one year, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not less?</span><span class="font10"> If so, please write a letter to the Office of the President right away expressing that willingness to serve at Bethel </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">for a full year.</span><span class="font10"> The letter should 'also Include your name, address, date of baptism, your age, height and weight, and draft classification. State the kinds of secular work in <sub>b</sub> which you have had experience, and * the amount of experience in each.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Capture the Spirit of the Assembly?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a fine spirit the recent district assemblies breathed! Did you feel that all the program features were designed and arranged so as to build up our spirituality?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Were you also impressed with the knowledge that our ministry actually includes our total </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">fife</span><span class="font10"> as a Christian? Were you not happy to know that we are performing vital features of the Christian ministry when we take good care of our families, teach our children, visit the sick or help needy or spiritually weak brothers and sisters? And that we should not feel discouraged when some have better success than others in various features of field service, but should rather rejoice, knowing we are members of a body, each member playing his important part?—1 Cor. 12:14-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, did you not rejoice in the ways provided to help the entire congregation to maintain strong spirituality as we approach the great tribulation and the attack by Gog of Magog?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Did you thrill as never before</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Also, tel! us how soon you would be able to come, if invited. Please attach a photograph of yourself. Before the letter is mailed, you should give it to your congregation servant to sign if he recommends you for this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you share in this special work, you will also benefit from the fine training that is enjoyed by all at Bethel, including the excellent evening program of reading, Bible research and lectures provided for all new members of the family. You wiil have the pleasure of associating with the Gilead students from many lands, as well as the rest of the Bethel family, some of whom have been in Jehovah’s service for forty years or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While here at Bethel you would with appreciation and zeal for the Divine Name as you listened to the assembly’s keynote talk? The spirit of RESPECT for Jehovah and those representing him should permeate the congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah’s spirit was manifestly directing the assemblies. Did you notice that the appeal made throughout tlie program was in harmony with the 110th Psalm: “Your people will offer themselves </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font10"> on the day of your military for&lt;*e’’? (vs. 3) We serve the King, not through coercion, but because we love him and are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">moved by Jehovah’s spirit to do his will.</span><span class="font10"> And we want to magnify Jehovah’s name by good ministry to him in all our affairs of everyday life. Our heart’s desire is to help others know that Name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you fully captured the spirit of the assembly you no doubt reviewed your own spirit in your home life, in your secular work, in association with the brothers at meetings and elsewhere, your spirit toward the overseers in the congre-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3) </span><span class="font10">live under the same arrangements as regular members of the family, but you would be a temporary worker.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Please give this matter prayerful consideration. If you qualify and desire to offer your services, let us know as soon as possible, because in September and October we would like to start calling In those who will be sharing in this special, urgent work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are looking forward to seeing you and your helping us out in this urgent work, but not on the night shift. We will have you work daytime. Be assured of my love and best wishes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Manifesting the Spirit of the Assemblies. (1 Thess. 5:23) Song 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Book study servant delivers “Kingdom Ministry” to infirm publisher and discusses Theocratic News and a few points from U.S.A, report for July, also local August report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">14 min: “Presenting the Good News— By Friendly Conversation.” Chairman asks one or two questions on paragraph one, then demonstrates suggestions in paragraphs two and three. Concludes very briefly with high points of paragraph four.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Increasing Our Spirituality. (1 Cor. 2:12, 13) Song 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Our Conduct Reflects on God’s Name. (Discussion group of several servants and parents) We know Jehovah’s witnesses are all “letters” being observed by all men. They view all Jehovah’s witnesses according to the conduct of those they happen to observe. Thus God’s name is exalted or reproached by what we do. New ones at meetings or assemblies judge us by our courtesy, consideration, orderliness. How are we doing in our congregation meetings? It is good to be there at start, if possible, and beneficial and respectful to stay through closing song and prayer. God has high regard for spiritual food he has arranged for us at meetings, and his “eyes” are upon us for good. (1 Pet. 3:12) Dlsorderliness, restlessness, moving about and talking during meetings reflect thoughtlessness, may even be manifestations of disrespect. To help children have proper respect and viewpoint, parents should sit with them at meetings. Basically, proper training begins at home. Only way children will develop respect and realize way God views them is by being trained in proper conduct and deep respect for family and home. This every parent should do, for “a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.” (Prov. 29:15) Jehovah’s people certainly want their children, rather, to bring honor to parents, thus honor to. God. (Some points may be made as to recent district assembly, with ways we can make conduct even more respectful between now and coming circuit and district assemblies.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Why Have the Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit Ceased?” Talk based on article in August 15, 1971, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">17 mln: “Increasing Spirituality in the Congregation.” Questions and answers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: “From Infancy You Have Known the Holy Writings.” (2 Tim. 3:15) Song 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">14 min: Do You Have a Training Program Specially Designed for Your Children? (Discussion between several servants and parents) Depending upon the ages of the children in the family, parents need to use discernment in •bringing up their children in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.’ (Eph. 6:4) Nevertheless, basic things are needed in any program, regardless of age. Discuss four basic ways education is imparted, as outlined under &quot;Education” in “Aid to Bible Understanding,” page 487. Discuss how parental training in Israel provides parallels for today's parents. See page 312 of “Aid,” paragraph six. Stress need to have regular study of the Bible with children at home, specially adapted to their needs. Use all provisions of Jehovah’s organization to give assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Parents Help Children Starting School. (Demonstration)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman: September is month most children start back to school. Often there will be new teachers, new classrooms, new situations to cope with in getting started back to school. Parents may find it advisable to accompany their children or arrange to speak with the teacher or principal at an early opportunity. Arrangements can be made to have children excused from participation in flag salute, holiday programs, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Father goes with young son and daughter to see principal of school. Makes known that family are Jehovah’s witnesses. While children want to cooperate fully in school program of education, certain exercises may conflict with religious beliefs. Discusses flag salute, singing patriotic songs, holiday programs. Children share in discussion appropriately too, giving evidence of good training and conviction on these matters. Principal asks few questions to get clarification on certain matters. Father gives brief witness and places copies of ’’Evolution” and “Word of God” books with principal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: Point out benefits of helping children in this way to get off to good start in school. Coaching them in advance on how to handle these delicate problems at school will help them to face issues courageously and be obedient as well as respectful servants of Jehovah. Even if school has already started, parents can still do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Presenting Subscriptions for “Awake!” in October. The special issue of “Awake!” will feature the subject “Relief from Today’s Pressures—How?” There are so many pressures bearing down on people today, and thus it will not be difficult to get a conversation going about this common problem. All should be Interested in finding relief, both now and in the future when God’s kingdom will fully remove the causes of these pressures. With this in mind, you may find the presentation used during the “Watchtower” campaign earlier this year to be effective. The theme of this was “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.” (For a full review, see 12/70 “Kingdom Ministry/ page 2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Rev. 21:3, 4—God’s kingdom to do away with sorrow, sickness and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dan. 2:44—God’s kingdom to crush all kingdoms that have oppressed mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ps. 37:10, 11—God’s kingdom to destroy the wicked one and provide abundance of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You need use only one of the above texts. The first could be applied to illness, pollution, or similar problems. The second, to oppression or injustice, etc. The third, to lawlessness or violence, both on the local as well as on the international scene. Make your presentation simple, yet meaningful and adaptable to the person with whom you are talking. It will be easy to tie in your presentation with the special “Awake!” and the offer of the year’s subscription for $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Express appreciation for good work of children in congregation. In conclusion, chairman asks accounts servant to comment briefly, from his seat, on highlights of article “Helping the Office with Subscriptions.” Song 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Make Known the God to Be Worshiped. (John 4:22) Song 57.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on theme for month, <sub>4 </sub>(See Nov. 15, 1970, issue of “The*. Watchtower.”) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talking Points on Special Issue of “Awake!” Magazine-territory servant has group on platform and review’s with them brief but meaningful points from magazine which they will use in presenting it to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: “Perfection—What Does It Really Mean?” (“Watchtower,” August 15, 1971) Audience discussion, using questions below. (Balance it out so that all parts receive the necessary coverage. Watch timing.) (a) What question often arises with regard to Adam and Eve as being perfect, yet sinning? (b) If, say, a shirt or a suit w’ore out after a reasonable length of time, would that mean it was imperfect? (c) What is the definition of “perfect,” and who sets the standards as to what is perfect, in the case of a shirt? (d) What, then, does the word “perfection” mean? (e) Who is the final judge of w’hat is perfect, as to mankind and the earth, and why? (f) Would it have been necessary for the first human pair to be incapable of sinning in order to be perfect? Why not? (g) Someone may say, ‘If Adam and Eve had been perfect, then they should have chosen only the right way. They should not have been able to choose the bad.’ What answ’er could be given? (Jas. 1:14, 15) (h) Will humans when perfect be able to perform any skillful work without learning and practicing it? (Compare Luke 2:52) (i) Will perfection eliminate all problems and the challenge of living? (j) What will perfection remove that troubles mankind today? (Rev. 21:3-5: 1 Cor. 15:25, 26)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How Is the spirit of your conI gregatlon?

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> At our recent district assemblies we were all impressed with the need to grow spiritually, but particularly were the overseers or “older men” admonished to ‘pay attention to themselves and all the flock, . . . to shepherd the congregation.’ (Acts 20: 28) This applies to all the “older men” and is admonition that should be implemented right away, each “older man” feeling keenly the need to adjust his schedule in order to do his part In shepherding the flock. The congregation servant can give general coordination so that all will be reached with the needed help and encouragement, but the Important thing is for each “older man” to be alert to the needs of the various members and to render this with loving concern.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The overseers In calling on members of the congregation are interested, not only in what is being done In the field ministry, but primarily in how the brothers are doing in keeping their appreciation for Jehovah strong, in building up love for one another, in seeing that they have joy in the ministry and in attending the meetings. None should feel that something must be wrong just because one of the overseers visits his home.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We had the joy of seeing 10,918 new brothers and sisters baptized in the United States during July. The total thus far this year is 40,091—nearly 10 percent of our total publishers. How fine to see that so many taking up the field service appreciate the Importance of their personal relationship with Jehovah! And the end is <sup>f</sup> not yet, for 289,318 Bible studies were being conducted with others who also show a desire to enjoy Jehovah’s approval. </span><span class="font10">out of love to see and converse with them about the things you enjoy talking about most—the good things in Jehovah’s word and his love for us. There is no need to bring up any known problem, unless this is serious and needs immediate attention. If a problem exists, usually this is mentioned by the brother or sister visited otdy after confidence is built up. If the servant is one who reads the Bible and the Society’s publications regularly, he will have his mind full of Scriptural things to talk about. Just taking the time to read over a portion of the Bible together (perhaps that assigned for the week in the ministry school) or an article in the magazines, will prove to be very encouraging and upbuilding.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes the spirit of complaint is encountered or a tendency to gossip about others of our brothers. Skillful and positive counsel from the Scriptures will help to set matters straight, and yet it is hoped that the ones visited will feel refreshed rather than scolded. One visit may not bring spirituality up to the desired level, but as various overseers keep calling much good will be accomplished, and as the spiritual health of each member keeps improving, the spirit of the whole congregation will remain at a good healthy level.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> It certainly is fine to be living in this time when the same spirit is manifested among God’s people that motivated the early Christian congregation.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> If you captured the spirit of the assembly you cannot help but be happy. You will want others to share this happiness.

It involves getting the people to talk with us, rather than endeavoring to preach a sermon. We have the best message in the world, and the most attractive to honest-hearted ones. Ry just conversing with them, we are more apt to reach their heart. But there is no reason for concern when some do not show a favorable response. Just show a willingness to share the good news with all, letting each one decide whether he will accept or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- In September we are presenting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book. You will find it easy to involve others in a conversation about the good things it contains and then present tile book so that the details can be studied. One does not have to be a scientist and argue on the level of the scholars in order to tell confidently how Jehovah created man and all other living things. How loving Jehovah has been in creating the earth as man’s home, with the climate, food, and other, resources being just right for his survival and happiness! Rather than looking forward merely to death and nonexistence, which is the only future the evolution theory leaves for man, those acting with insight have the grand and trustworthy hope of living in a cleansed earth, and not just for a short time, but forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do you have some difficulty getting the conversation started? Whether in tlie actual door-to-door work, or incidental witnessing, comments on crime, pollution, problems of youth,’ family, government, war, conditions in the churches or among church members, particularly anything of local interest that touches on a person’s life, can bg used to start conversations, even the weather. Questions can be used very effectively to get the opinion of the listener, and see how he is thinking and responding. This may lead to placing literature. You may be able to get a Bible study started. If this is not possible on the first occasion, perhaps arrangements can be made to return and further the discussion. If not, there is no reason to be discouraged, but there can be satisfaction that you were able to give the witness to another in an effort to locate the Lord's “sheep.” As you keep preaching, taking advantage of every opportunity, your skill in presenting the good news simply and yet effectively will increase, and your joy in Jehovah’s service will steadily increase too. And, if you do have success in getting a Bible study started, what a thrill it will be to conduct this regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> So, in the final analysis, it is not a matter of mastering a complex sermon or having something spectacular to say at the doors, but simply and sincerely presenting the best of news involving God’s kingdom. How we love to talk about this! Of course, we want to have some definite ideas in mind in going to the people and that is -why it is good to do some preparing in advance. Practice sessions will help. Talk over what you plan to say with others in the family or congregation. Get their suggestions. Practice with one another, having in mind local conditions in the territory. Then just thoroughly enjoy talking to others about the good things in your heart.</span></p>

He might choose to reduce his field service one Sunday a month in order to make several visits. Evenings are probably the best time. Saturday morning or afternoon may be convenient, or one call might be made after each period of field service. Each one’s circumstances are different, but with genuine concern and love for the brothers, the “older men’’ will arrange the time within their busy schedules to visit all in the flock because of their love for their brothers. They will do this even though at times they may not be able to spend quite as much time in the field ministry. And do we not appreciate what they do for us as shepherds of the flock? We certainly do!</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font9">• What is the Society’s position on large, organized groups of brothers attending assemblies in distant lands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society tries to arrange district assemblies for the convenience of brothers in each country. Thus it is not necessary for publishers to travel great distances to attend an assembly. When convention facilities are arranged, they are for the convenience of those whom the Society expects to attend. If greater numbers of witnesses attend than are planned for, <sub>f </sub>then the facilities are overcrowded and this inconveniences the convention ers of that locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Occasionally the Society does arrange for international assemblies, and announces these well in advance. Then facilities are obtained to take care of any large overseas groups that might be coming. If at such time the Society thinks it advisable to encourage some brothers to travel to a different land the Society will do so. This is because of the witness that can be given and for the encouragement of the brothers they meet with in another land. In these instances the Society gives the congregations detailed information on Society stationery and the travel is handled by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a congregation or individuals receive correspondence from a travel agency encouraging them to travel with a group to some foreign country, saying it is to attend a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, this is very likely a business promotional scheme of tlie travel agency. Please do not write to the Society about travel agency arrangements because the Society is not involved and does not have any knowledge of such arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If any brothers wish to travel from one country to another, that is their personal business, not the Society's. Of course, under those circumstances they have to arrange their own transportation and they cannot expect the branch offices of the Society to take care of them as the Society does when it arranges for travel to assemblies in other countries.</span></p>

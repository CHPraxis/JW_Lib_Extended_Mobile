<p><span class="font10">More Gilead students have arrived. We wish you could have been with us on October 18 when these ninetyeight brothers and sisters of the 52nd class were introduced to the Bethel family. They are serious-minded and enthusiastic, with a variety of backgrounds, having come from Denmark, Germany, Malagasy Republic, Puerto Rico and from many sections of the United States and Canada. Along with other studies they are learning Portuguese, Spanish, French and Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is too early to give you a report on how many </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’ </span><span class="font10">books were placed during November, but the Brooklyn plant has shipped out over 1,700,000 copies. Now, during the month of December we have a wonderful follow-up offer for the people, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Don’t forget, besides English, this delightful Bible translation is printed in Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish for those reading those languages. And remember, too, for only $5 a large-print edition is available in English for those who prefer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are also pleased to announce that a new Bible study folder is being printed—20,000,000 of them! These are being shipped free of charge with your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks.</span><span class="font10"> Order more when you need them. Printing of the earlier study folders has been discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This new folder gives a very fine witness concerning Jehovah himself, and it tells the reader about the new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book. It also outlines the Bible study arrangement in such a way that you can use </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">any book you may choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be sure to leave the folder when householders do not take other literature. Also leave it where no one is at home. It is like leaving your footprints behind. But not in mailboxes, for that is against postal regulations. Let them know that Jehovah’s witnesses have called again 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of our love, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>How do you feel when you receive a new publication from the Society or a new issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span><span class="font10"> Really, we are deeply indebted to Jehovah for his provisions and very grateful for his loving direction, aren’t we? And, above all, the Word of Jehovah itself, the Bible, is our most treasured publication and principal textbook, for it is the very basis of our fa</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ith</span><span class="font10"> in Jehovah’s promises. Surely we ought’ to know'how It was produced, what it contains and how to use it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s people we realize that without the Bible we xy°<sup>ul&lt;</sup>l never have come to know the real purpose of life, but learning what it really is has been most encouraging to each and every one of us. This has helped us to press on despite worsening world conditions. The Bible .contains information that oth</span><span class="font9">erwise </span><span class="font10">would not be available to us, suvh<sup>-</sup>'as^^knowledge of things that took place before man was on the scene. (Gen. 1:1-26) The Bible also tells us about conversations that took place in the heavens and that no human ears could hear unless Jehovah provided the information. These things strengthen our faith!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> More importantly, the Bible acquaints us with Jehovah himself, his name, his outstanding- qualities, his Son and the important place that he occupies in God’s purposes. (Col. 1: 17,18; 2: 3) And as a book of prophecy, the Bible truly is outstanding. It has no equal. It alone has given true significance to events of history and shows why they turned out the way they did. (Luke_ 19: </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">41-4</span><span class="font10">4) Moreover, the Bible shows the future of all present worldly governments (Dan. 2 : 44), and explains the events of our day, showing that soon Jehovah will clear away all of the wicked. (Ps. 37 : 9, 10) What compelling reasons there are to read God’s Word daily!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you have had difficulty in keeping up with the suggested sched</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">ule for Bible reading each week, could you make it your resolve to try to keep pace during December? This would mean reading Jeremiah 38 to 52, only 15 chapters. If we allowed about five minutes a day to read half a chapter, that would keep us nicely abreast of this fascinating material. And since there is so much power in the Word of Jehovah, it will motivate us from the heart to be witnesses of Jehovah’s Messiah everywhere.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Yes, reading and studying the Bible give </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">us th</span><span class="font10">e, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">^courag</span><span class="font10">e to be witnesses of<sup>x</sup> Jehovah’s Messiah in these momentous days. December offers us a splendid opportunity to share the Bible with everyone whose heart is inclined toward righteousness, for we will be using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font10"> in all the languages in which it appears, together with the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?,</span><span class="font10"> for a $1.25 contribution. What an excellent combination ! Also, many of us in our own personal study and research have been thrilled with the value of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of Hie Greek Scriptures.</span><span class="font10"> This translation’lias opened up new vistas of understanding and depth of appreciation for Jehovah’s Word. Those of us who are acquainted with individuals who are very much interested in a study of the Bible and who enjoy it may want to introduce </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> As you receive this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> surely you are rejoicing in the series of talks currently being delivered on the new book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“The Nations Shall Know that </span><span class="font10">Y </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">AmJehovalt”—How?</span><span class="font10"> Are not these 'Talks stimulating our appreciation for Jehovah and motivating us to share these truths about his name and his will with others before it is too late?

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> is also of great value in aiding interested ones to appreciate the field ministry and the part they can have in it. You may want to explain that activity in the field ministry is reported to the local congregation and then to the branch, and finally to the Society’s headquarters. If Bible students have progressed to the point where they are qualified to participate in field service, they can be shown how they may have the joy of contributing their part no matter how insignificant it may seem to them. It takes single grains of sand to make up the seashore and single drops of water to make up the mighty oceans. Help them to appreciate that during December they, too, can have a share in the tremendous witness being given throughout the earth by Jehovah’s faithful servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Part in the Ministry School</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>x</sup>As you ifiay have noticed from the new Theocratic Ministry School schedule, a wealth of information will be covered during the 1972 calendar year. Why? To help us to become better servants of Jehovah God now. Also, to prepare us for life in the new system of things. Surely, if at all possible, you will want to be present for each session of the school to receive education that simply cannot be had anywhere else.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If you have read the instructions on the new school schedule, you doubtless noted a number of changes. These should make the school more enjoyable and beneficial for all of us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As you prepare your talks, you will find that there is an abundance of excellent material. How much of it should you try to cover? Of course, it often is not possible to covei’ every point. Do not sacrifice good teaching methods. But we ought to discuss more than an isolated sentence or two, and we should not always use only the “milk” of the word and skip over the “meat.” Come to. grips with material that will be truly informative to the congregation. There are fine points that aid us to understand certain scriptures more clearly, and we all want to benefit from these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> It is all right to use field service settings where appropriate. But sisters may at times find that a field service setting would greatly limit their coverage of the material. In that case it would be much better to have the assistant take the part of a person who has a background in the truth. The presentation could then take the form of a discussion with another member of the family or another publisher. And if you</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">A new peak in publishers, the first in our service year—this is the good news we have to share with you, brothers! Yes, 418,402 engaged in the field ministry during October. The report underscores your determination: On with the marking work of the King’s secretary! Your good work also resulted in 159,909 subscriptions being obtained. “Awake!” will now be coming regularly into many more homes. It helps people to see the religious abominations of Christendom. May many new subscribers become righteously disposed, enabling us to satisfy their spiritual need. </span><span class="font10">want to have your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font10"> book (or other textbook) in your hand as you discuss the material from it, there is nd objection to your doing so.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Even when we are not scheduled to give a talk, preparation for the school is beneficial. It helps us to impress the information more deeply upon our minds and hearts. True, not everyone is able to spend the same amount of time in advance preparation. But we can all do some.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> As an aid in learning, you may also find it helpful to have your book open to the material being discussed by each speaker. When a particularly helpful or interesting point is made, find it in the publication and underscore it. This may help to impress it on your mind, facilitate your finding it in the future and, in the case of the instruction talk, make it easier for you to participate in the oral review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School indeed has much to offer us in the months ahead. How fine it will be to listen to the informative, encouraging talks! Additionally, we can be certain of Jehovah’s blessing as we share to the extent possible in making each session of the school an hour of spiritual refreshment.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Now, for a f</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span><span class="font10">w</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">, minutes,</span><span class="font10"> think about those wfth whom you might be able to place the Bible or one of the new books this month. Why not make a list? If you write down the names of these folks and then call on them as early as possible during the month, it may be surprising to see what can be accomplished during December. And since we really want to help these people, you might want to take a few moments with other members of your family to practice how to approach various householders and interested ones in your territory. This will sharpen your ability to present the offer and your desire to share in the field ministry.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> If it is possible to get some persons started in the actual field ministry this month, especially those who have been studying the Bible for a number of months and who qualify as well as show a desire to share in presenting the good news, why not do so at this time. What a blessing this will mean for them and for those who listen to them! Indeed, our principal textbook, the Bible, is an influence for good in our lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Few Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Would you like to try some of the suggestions that various traveling representatives of the Society have used recently in getting subscriptions foi' the magazines? Listed here are five that you may find useful.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Have a positive approach, drawing attention to the specific contents of the magazines you are presenting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Try offering both subscriptions instead of one. One circuit servant reported that he obtained nine subscriptions in just one day by doing this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. You may find it useful to say that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> has been published for over 90 years. Obviously, it is quite experienced in presenting spiritual food at the right time.</span></p></li>

Also beginning in February, there is a forceful new public talk to be given at circuit assemblies, on the subject “Are You ‘Marked’ for Survival?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Can you use the world’s holiday season to increase your praise to Jehovah? If your circumstances permit, why not be a vacation pioneer or arrange to spend some full days in field service? Congregation servants can make special arrangements for witnessing for the holidays. It is a good time for field service, since so many people are at home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Within Our Sphere of Influence</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How much influence do you have? Perhaps more than you realize. Each one of us has a certain group of relatives, business acquaintances, fellow workers, schoolmates and neighbors who know us well because of our association with them over a period of time. These individuals are really within our sphere of influence and they will likely be more receptive to the Kingdom message when it is presented by someone they already know than by a stranger calling at their doors. Thus we can use our “influence” for good by tactfully taking advantage of opportunities to speak with them about the Bible and even by making opportunities to do this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Possibly you have tried witnessing to relatives or acquaintances in the past and have found it somewhat difficult, even discouraging. If this has been your experience, perhaps you can improve your methods so as to become more effective. Of course, it is good to realize that not all will be interested the first time you approach them. However, if you are tactful, in the future there will likely be many other opportunities to converse with them about Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A friendly conversation with anyone provides a fine basis for a witness, since the person is already in a favorable frame of mind. To maintain this, we need to exercise tact and discernment, being sensitive to the attitude of the individual. Sometimes a question will turn a conversation to a subject that will make it easy for us to show what the future holds for this system of things. We can then contrast this with Jehovah’s righteous new order. For example, we can ask: “Do you think the East and the West will ever get together and solve their differences?” “Do you think world conditions will continue to deteriorate?” “Why is there so much trouble in the earth today?” Or, “Why do we all feel so much pressure upon us?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> These and other questions may direct the conversation toward the Bible answer; they may also help us to determine what the other person is thinking. Thus we can tailor our presentations according to the attitude of individuals, making the necessary adjustments or perhaps even discontinuing our efforts entirely for the time being, depending upon the response we get.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another method that many have found successful is to get others to ask us questions. Even here, though, we must discern whether merely to answer the questions without further comment or to elaborate, perhaps even explaining the Bible’s teaching on related matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> On occasion, you might ask if your acquaintance had a good weekend, and when he has commented, you might mention a circuit or district assembly or some other meeting you attended that weekend and something of interest you learned that might stir his curiosity—perhaps a point from the public talk or something you learned from your Bible reading. Did you enjoy some thought-provoking observation at a recent meeting? or have an interesting experience in the field ministry? Then why not comment on it briefly? Possibly this will evoke some comment or question from your companion. If the approach does not arouse interest, another approach or renewed efforts at a later time may prove successful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> By using the influence we have with others in the right way and at the right times, we may be able to stir up in them a desire for the truth. What a joy to use our influence on others for their blessing so they may share with us the hope of everlasting life!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Few Suggestions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cowfd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">add up the exact number of Scriptural references in one issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> In many cases there are over 150. Yes, what is presented in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is solidly founded in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5. If you meet a busy person at the door, you can give him an option. He might want to take just the two latest copies for 10 cents or he might want a subscription for just $1.50 a year so that one of the magazines will conveniently come to his home on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Likely some of these thoughts will prove helpful to you as they have to others. We sincerely hope so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">• How can we help those who have been inactive for a long period of time to requalify as publishers of the good news?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each year circuit servants report that a number of publishers have fallen into inactivity. Often it is because these folks have allowed the pressures and anxieties of this system of things to encroach upon their worship of Jehovah, causing them to slow down. When individuals slow down and stop associating with us at meetings and in the field ministry, there is evidence of serious spiritual weakness. If you encounter such a person, urge him to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall again. In some cases, where there is evidence that the person wants to serve Jehovah again, he might be helped by having a home Bible study, or perhaps using appropriate “Watchtower” articles, to build him up in faith.—Jas. 2:14; Heb. 5:12-14; 10:23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because the “older men” in the congregations are especially concerned for the safety and needs of the flock, they are willing to take the necessary time for friendly visits to build up inactive ones through spiritual discussions, provided the inactive ones show a sincere desire to return to the flock of God. When the root cause of the problem is ascertained, the needed spiritual help can be given. They ought to be encouraged to study Jehovah’s Word regularly, both personally and as a family group.—Isa. 32:2; John 21:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If someone has been inactive and has not associated with the congregation for a long time, it would be reasonable to expect that the inactive one should meet the basic requirements outlined on page 108 of the “Lamp” book, which includes fairly consistent attendance at the congregational meetings and an earnest desire to be a minister of the good news, before being considered as a publisher once again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">NOVEMBER 1971</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;You will be witnesses of me ... to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1: 8. VOL. <sup>X,V NO</sup>- <sup>1</sup> ’</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Qean</span><span class="font12"> ^Pub&amp;sk/ts:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine our surprise when, as of October 15, letters had been received from 1,552 persons—some even from Alaska, Bermuda, Britain, Colombia, Hawaii, Jamaica and Peru—saying that they would like to be among the one hundred invited to share in urgent work at Bethel for a year! Thank you very much for this tremendous response! It reminds ns of Psalm 110:3, where it foretold how Jehovah’s people would offer themselves willingly in this His day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are happy to say that the hundred brothers needed are now here. No more will be invited on this basis, but, due to the press of work, we will not write personal letters of reply to the rest of you who volunteered. However, if any of you desire to come to Bethel on sie regular four-year basis, you may request an application from the Society or from your circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, there are certainly a lot of new faces around Bethel these days, some 250, due in part to the expansion of the Kingdom Ministry School and the start of the fifty-second class of Gilead. Our housing facilities here are once again filled to the hilt, even though nine buildings are now being used to house us here in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But we are happy, for we are able to accomplish a lot in the Lord's work. With 91 brothers on a night shift, production is tremendous. Why, in just the first seven weeks of this double shift 4,638,604 bound books, 2,028,943 booklets and 35,718,200 magazines were produced. This made It possible to speed up shipments to the Branches and congregations before the New York dock strike took effect October 1. In September alone 3,392,081 books and Bibles were shipped out in both English and Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is much for all of us to do, and we all desire to prove faithful to God. So whether here at Bethel or in the field, let all of us display f'hristlike obedience under test, to Jehovah’s praise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers and felloiy servants, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They Will Have to Know Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How thrilled we were this past summer to receive the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“The Nations Shall Know that I </span><span class="font10">.4»i </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah”—How? The</span><span class="font10"> urgency of the times, the importance of the sacred name, the impending change in the administration of man’s affairs—these are points that were vividly’ impressed on our minds as we read this book. One brother after reading it exclaimed: “It’s the most exciting preview of things to come that we have ever had!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> But not many persons have read this exciting “preview of things to come.” As a result, few persons have any idea of Jehovah’s violent judgments soon to befall the false religious systems of which they themselves may be a part.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> It is not because these people never had the opportunity to know. By and large, the apathy’ of the people is due to the Devil’s blinding their minds. Does that mean that it is futile to continue going from house to house? Not at all! Whether people listen or not, it is God’s will that the witness continue to be given. (Ezek. 2:5) This magnifies his love and his justice, and it is our privilege to have a share in it. Furthermore, in your community there are no doubt some persons who ‘sign and groan’ because of the detestable conditions in Christendom. These individuals must be ‘marked on the forehead’ in order to escape destruction. But how?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■* In large measure it is up to us. This new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know”</span><span class="font10"> book is particularly important to these “sighing and groaning” ones. Hence, we ought to be diligent to share its contents with everyone who will accept it. Distributing this book is a privilege that not many of earth’s population have. It is also a challenge that few are willing to accept. Let us therefore joyfully seize this privilege and challenge and feature the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know” </span><span class="font10">book in our field ministry during the month of November.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> First of all, offer this new publication at every door and give everyone to whom you speak an opportunity to know Jehovah as we know him. Do you think this is a difficult assignment? Not when compared to Ezekiel’s assignment. Leaving with people a bound book, which they can read at their leisure, is much easier than lying forty days on one side and then three hundred and ninety’ days on the other without turning, while at the same time living on a very restricted diet. Truly our assignment is much easier. —Ezek. 4:1-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> But some may feel that an explanation of Ezekiel’s prophecy is too deep and difficult for the average person, and therefore we should offer the people something simpler. Well, comparing the new book with the book of Ezekiel, which of the two is easier to read and understand? Is not the prophecy as it was first delivered more difficult than the published explanation in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know” </span><span class="font10">book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Let us remember, too, that it was Jehovah who told Ezekiel what to say to his generation. It was not Ezekiel's prerogative to complain that it was a message too difficult for the people to understand. Similarly today, it is not for us to complain about Jehovah’s 'methods and arrangements for warning the nations of impending destruction. Actually, Jehovah in his mercy has made the message very understandable and has made it much easier for people today to get to know him for their salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Tens of millions of persons already have the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book. Most of them are no longer on our back-call lists but they are friendly when we call. Try again to help them. Perhaps the powerful message in the new book is what will shake them out of their apathy. So, offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know”</span><span class="font10"> book at every door, and with real enthusiasm.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 7</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Love of God Means Obedience. (1 John 5:3) Song 115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Also, discuss the Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">23 min: “They Will Have to Know Jehovah.” Audience participation. Build up enthusiasm for the privilege of having a part in giving a powerful witness to Jehovah’s name by distribution of the new book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Demonstration: Have a publisher make two house-to-house calls with the new book. At the first door, the householder is not interested, so publisher uses brief presentation suggested on page 2 of October “Kingdom Ministry.” No placement. Ask audience what good was accomplished. Next, publisher calls at another door. Here he is able to give fuller presentation and places book. Use discussion on theme “Know Jehovah” from October “Kingdom Ministry.” At certain points you may want to stop publisher and ask audience why certain things were effective or how to handle situations that have arisen. Direct attention to specific points in. the book that can be shown to householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Conclude with reminder about special public talk based on “Know” book. Encourage publishers to bring as many interested persons as possible, also personally to read material from the book in advance, if they can work it into their schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Christian Obedience to Law. Talk based on principles in Chapter 18 of &quot;Truth” book; also see pages 1240 and 1241 of “Aid.” Work in experiences from “1971 Yearbook,” pages 111, 1J3; 224-226; 289, 1J4. Draw audience into discussion on points that show how this counsel applies in our own lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts report. Encourage all to remember those in their own congregation who may be enduring severe tests because of obedience to God; recommend personal visits and other encouragement. Song 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Teaching That Reaches the Heart. (Rom. 10:10) Song 108.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Introduction, text and comments. Arrange in advance for some to relate experiences drawing attention to fine arguments, or good teaching, used by those who helped them to learn the truth. (If needed, see “1969 Yearbook,” pages 74, 111; “1971 Yearbook,” page 92.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: How to Reach the Heart When Teaching. Talk showing how to do this in teaching one’s own children, also when making back-calls and conducting Bible studies. For source material see pages 75-78 of “Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,” also “Watchtower” of March 1, 1971.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22 min: “Be Prepared.” Audience participation. When considering paragraph 4, demonstrate: Conclusion of home Bible study conducted with family of three. Students were assigned in advance; two prepared magazine presentations (one featuring “Watchtower,” the other emphasizing “Awake!”), and one found an answer to a Bible question common in local territory by using “Watch Tower Publications Index” and Kingdom Hall library. Each one is asked to present what he has prepared; publisher commends, also asks others in family what they learned from the other’s presentation. Encourage them not to be unduly concerned about phrasing but to speak from the heart. 10 min: Concluding comments. If group witnessing planned for November 25, mention tnis. Encourage any who plan to vacation pioneer during December school holidays to turn in applications. Build up enthusiasm for special public talk. Comment on Romans 10:10. Song 103.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Help Those Related to You to Grow in Faith. Song 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Also discuss Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —to Your Relatives.” Questions and answers. Arrange in advance for publishers to relate experiences showing how their relatives endeavored to interest them in the truth or how they are trying to help their relatives now. May include experiences from “1969 Yearbook,” page 118, 113; “1967 Yearbook,” page 215, TJ2; November 8, 1967, “Awake!” page 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Are You Having a Regular Family Study in Your Home? (Material may be drawn from “Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,” pages 37, 38, also article “Family Study a Blessing,” in February 15, 1971, “Watchtower.”) This part should be handled by a brother who sets a good example in this regard. Ask audience to read key scriptures; analyze them together. Talk in advance to family heads, as well as those in divided homes, and find out what problems arise that interfere with regular family study, why some do not continue, etc. Bring up these problems and draw out suggestions from audience. Emphasize the importance and value of family study. Discuss how to make it enjoyable for all the family. Offer suggestions on when to have the study and point out the need to consider home circumstances in determining how long study sessions should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate Announcements and Theocratic News items. Song 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Everywhere Be Witnesses of Jehovah’s Messiah. (Acts 1:8) Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Talk on service theme for December. (See “Watchtower” of December 15, 1970.) Show that as witnesses of the Messiah we draw attention to Jehovah, the One who anointed Jesus. When we tell about Jesus’ teaching, we publicize God's name, as Jesus did. Point out difference between worldwide witnessing and world conversion. Emphasize value of “Know” book in giving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Those Who Stick.” Questions and answers; read paragraphs. Draw out comments to show how these points affect every publisher of the good news. Could arrange for someone to relate experiences found in “1968 Yearbook,” page 122, 114, 5; “The Watchtower” for 1970, page 763, H7, to page 764, J2; page 510, col. 1, 1i3; for 1967, page 255, col. 2, JI; for 1966, page 446, col. 2, lil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Witnessing with the “New 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">World Translation” During Decembe*** Discussion and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Explain that offer for the month is “New World Translation” and &quot;Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” for $1.25. If the householder already has the “New World Translation,” offer the book “ ’The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah’—How?” with a booklet, for 50 cents. If publishers want to keep on using the Scripture presentation that they used during November, that is fine. If some want a different presentation, the following thoughts may be helpful:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Usually we have little difficulty engaging people in conversation about economic problems, violence, immorality, family difficulties, etc. Your presentation could be designed to invite their expressions on one of these current problems. Then use their response as an opportunity to direct attention to some practical advice from the Bible. (See “Word of God” book, Chapter 11, “Is the Bible Practical for Our Day?” for talking points.) You can read from the Bible, or, if you prefer, read the scriptures out of the book along with the accompanying explanation. Having showed the value of the Bible’s counsel, offer the modern-language “New World Translation” and the “Word of God” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Include suggestions on how to plan field service during cold weather so as to accomplish the most good. Song 100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They Will Have to Know Jehovah</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(ConVd)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Likewise, do not overlook <sup>v </sup>opportunity of offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know”* ' </span><span class="font10">book to .ill the people on whom you are presently making back-calls, as well as to all those with whom you are conducting home Bible studies. Certainly all these people especially need to read this book in addition to the material we are now studying with them. If they do, it may well hasten their progress in the way that leads to everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> We have a message from Jehovah. Let us deliver it. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">They wiU have to know Jehovah!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1972 443,182 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We did very well during the first month of our new service year. We had 408,345 publishers sharing the good news. We placed an average of almost two books per publisher, or a total of 813,403! Isn’t that fine? What a blessing the &quot;Evolution” book will be to those many persons whose minds have been permeated with that godless philosophy! Many will have their thinking readjusted and minds opened to God’s truth because of your good work in September.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Prepared</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah's love for mankind is great. “He does not desire any to lie &quot;destroyed but desires all to attain repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Yes, God really cares for people, and we do too because we serve God and imitate his quality of love. We want others to know Jehovah and to love him as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font10"> do. But Satan has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so we need to overcome objections and prejudices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul counseled that Christians should lie “ready for every good work.” (Titus 3:1) They should be prepared in mind and heart, having the right outlook, so they are willing to share. And when they know what good work needs to be done—preaching the good news to others, for example—it is only reasonable that some further preparation be done. Thus they will be not only willing but also able to explain the truth clearly, and to overcome objections and prejudices in order to gain a hearing ear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In what ways can we prepare? Of course, our personal study of the Bible, the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and our student talks are definitely included. But is there some additional preparation that can be of great practical value? Yes, we can talk to other brothers and . -^sisters, asking them for suggestions ' and practicing together how to handle objections and questions that come up in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> An excellent opportunity for this sort of preparation is when Bible students progress to the point where they want to accompany you in the field service. Why not take some time after your weekly study with them to let them practice what they will be saying in the service? Keep it simple and commend them warmly. Improvement will come gradually, and practicing together will help.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font8">♦ Literature offer for November: “The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”—How?</span><span class="font8"> with a booklet, for 50 cents. For December: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> and Is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font8"> for $1.25. If householders already have the Bible, offer the “Know” book, with a booklet, for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Worldly holidays during November and December present fine opportunities for increased field service. Can you vacation pioneer during that time? If so, now is the time to apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Society has produced a new set of postcards, with a variety of views oi Bethel, the factories, Watchtower Farm, and so forth. A set of ten may be had for 25 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ New Publications Available:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another time we can do some preparing is when we are in a car group traveling to a territory. We may present objections common to that area and ask those in the group for points they have found useful in overcoming them. Then, too, a fine place to practice field points is at meetings for field service. When we get into the territory the suggestions will be fresh in our minds. Also, what about practicing within the family circle? At a suitable time, perhaps after the family study, each family member could take turns being the householder, raising objections. The others could offer suggestions as to how they can be overcome.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">« In these brief periods of practice, keep in mind that there may be several ways to deal with a situation or objection. What works for one may not lie as effective for another. We help each other when ideas are shared that each one can work into the type of presentation he finds best suited for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> No doubt about it, just as preparation will help to sharpen skills in any other human activity, preparation will help to sharpen our preaching and teaching skills. Of course, there is no substitute for the experience of actually talking to people in the field ministry. That is the best practice of all, but we can help that along by some preparation in advance.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Those Who Stick</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There are many fine privileges of service that one can have in Jehovah’s organization. Pioneering and Bethel service are examples. Many have held on to such special privileges for five, ten, twenty or more years, even as early prophets and apostles stuck to their special assignments. What enables persons to stick?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One vital factor is that they find joy in their service to God. As Nehemiah said : &quot;The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” (Neb. 8:10) Such joy gives them a feeling of security and is a source of strength. But does that mean they never became discouraged? No. Even Jehovah’s faithful prophet Jeremiah became discouraged, and once he felt like quitting. But he did not act rashly, and he got over his problem.—Jer. 20: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Unresponsiveness and opposition were what caused Jeremiah to get discouraged. The prophet Elijah also became downhearted; he felt alone in carrying on God’s service, having no one. as it were, to work with. (1 Ki. 19:9-18) At times Jehovah’s servants today get discouraged for similar reasons. But those who stick have the &quot;joy of Jehovah.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Obviously this joy does not come only from finding sheeplike persons in the field ministry. It is not dependent on doing work that in itself is necessarily pleasant. True, meeting people who accept God’s truth is a source of uplift. But in some places there is little favorable response. And there is much that must be done in operating Bethel homes and printeries, to provide Bible literature, that is just plain hard work. What enables some to stay on in such assignments? “The joy of Jehovah.” Do you have it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Such joy does not rest simply on the response of others—whether they accept literature, an offer of a home Bil(le study, and so forth. Nor does it depend upon having personal conveniences, perhaps a partner with whom to work or a car for transportation. It is not something that a person has when carrying out certain theocratic activities but loses when given other assignments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The sustaining “joy of Jehovah” is the portion of those who have learned to see things from Jehovah’s viewpoint. They are grateful to be used by Jehovah, and personal convenience does not dictate their decisions. (Ps. 110:3) They count it a privilege beyond compare to contribute in full measure to the praise of their loving God, Jehovah. Appreciation of their relationship to Jehovah is what helps them to stick.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To Your Relatives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We want our relatives to learn God’s truth and to gain everlasting life along with us, don’t we? As Andrew helped his brother Peter, we want to share the truth with our relatives. (John 1: 41, 42) Of course, it is wise not to try to tell your unbelieving relatives everything at once. A few main points, or just one, may be enough the first few times. Even if they show little interest, persist in sharing the good news as opportunity affords.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> You will find it helpful to be alert to what interests your relatives. Are they concerned about world conditions, the increase in violence and crime? Then you may have opportunity to talk to them about Bible prophecy and what was foretold for our day. This may lead to your presenting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth,</span><span class="font10"> book and starting a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Some brothers report they have found it beneficial to go over the articles in each issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and then ask themselves. Would any article in this issue be of special interest to a certain relative, young or old? You might even make a list of your relatives, and as you examine the articles, go over the list and determine who might enjoy a certain article. Articles such as “Teaching Your Daughter About Housekeeping” and “Stamp Collecting as a Hobby” are of that sort. To some relatives you might send an article that reports on recent assemblies, along with a brief letter telling them what you did this past summer. If one has a Baptist relative, then the article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">on “Baptist Concern over Church Problems” would be a good one to send them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦There are other ways to reach them too. Now that we have the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> book, why not make it a gift to your young relatives? You may want to write a message on the inside cover, making the book a personalized gift. Because of the nature of the material, it will be welcome in many households. If a child to whom you give the book asks his father or mother to read him the stories, then the parents may learn God’s truth while reading it to the child. It is a direct way to reach the child and an indirect way to reach the parents. The logic and wholesomeness of the material may appeal to tiie parent, cause him to ask questions and open the way for a home Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Many publishers report having used the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> books to help relatives who had little interest or faith in God’s Word or who were opposed. One publisher in Ohio had a grandmother very much opposed to the truth. “After she came to stay a few days with us,” reports the publisher, “my grandmother picked up the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book and began reading it. By (he time she left, she had asked for her own copy and had read quite a bit of it. The next time she came, I asked her if she would like to have the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, since she enjoyed the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book so much. She was happy to have it. A study was started and she now attends most of the meetings.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Here is another suggestion. Have you ever made a gift of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> to a relative? Some publishers have done this, and with good results. They know that their relatives might not read a book about doctrinal matters, so they give them a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> explaining that it is a book that tells about the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and the work it is doing around the world. You might say, “I thought you would like to read this report on what the Witnesses are doing and the fascinating experiences they have had in various parts of the world.” This year why not order a few extra copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font10">and give them to your relatives?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If your relatives live far away, you can witness to them by mail. If any show interest and you cannot personally visit them, feel free to write the Society, and the information will be sent to a congregation in the vicinity where your relative lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> Often it is true that time and change of circumstance or developments in the world make persons more favorably disposed than in the past. So do not give up in presenting the good news to your relatives.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font8">• Should the eighty questions in the “Lamp&quot; book be covered in personal Bible studies with interested persons ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “Lamp&quot; book is not intended for general public distribution. So it is not something that we offer to people as a basis for study when we first begin to call on them. There is no objection to your using it to answer some of their questions. But to obtain a personal copy, the student must make request of the congregation servant, and this he would do when he is making good progress toward dedication and baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is nothing secret about the answers to those eighty questions. The student is encouraged to study them carefully before the overseers review the material with him in preparation for his baptism. If the student needs some help with that review, there is no objection -to your discussing the material together. Any discussion of the Bible and of the Society’s literature explaining the Bible is wholesome and is to be encouraged. But it would not be wise to bypass a personal study of the “Truth&quot; book, thinking that the vital points can be learned simply by studying the eighty questions. Nor should we review those eighty questions in such a way that we are encouraging the person to memorize certain answers. The important thing is to promote understanding and appreciation of the truth, and private discussion can do much to accomplish this.</span></p>

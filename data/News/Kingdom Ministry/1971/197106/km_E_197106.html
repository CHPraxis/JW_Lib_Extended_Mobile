<p><span class="font10">Jehovah be praised!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I will laud you, O Jehovah, with all my heart.” (I’s. 9:1) That is just the way we feel. We know that all of you Kingdom publishers feel the same way because you have been doing that during the entire month of April. Now it has been our good pleasure to compile your report. And we are just amazed at what it shows! During April a great shout of praise went up from the lips of 416,789 publishers! That represents another big increase, and our fifth consecutive peak!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only did you have great pleasure in talking to others about God’s kingdom, but many were interested in what you said. This is evident in the fact that you obtained 286,620 subscriptions. The total for the fourmonth campaign reached 906,504— 169,416 more than last year. Here in Brooklyn we are still processing this great flood of new subscriptions. And the distribution of magazines for April came to by far the highest mark ever—10,827,701, and all of them directing people to God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though you were featuring </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> in April, you were still able to put out 438,632 books. With all the magazines and books that you have placed, is it any wonder that we find it necessary to work day and night at the Brooklyn factory to keep you supplied? We are very happy about this and grateful to Jehovah that we have the opportunity, the equipment and the strength to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An outstanding number were able to serve as pioneers during this month of special activity. There were 883 special pioneers, 15,502 regular pioneers (a new peak) and an all-time new record of 31,847 vacation pioneers. This surpassed the previous peak of vacation pioneers by 6,399. Isn’t that wonderful? So many of you—both publishers and pioneers—put in more time declaring the good news, that the total hours came to 8,197,565—over</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Since we in our field ministry encourage others to read the Bible, we should be able to answer “Yes” if questioned, “Have </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font10"> read it?” Those of us who are new publishers of the good news may not have yet completed reading the Bible in its entirety. However, all of us know that Bible reading is a “must” and should, therefore, take priority over TV or other similar pursuits. (Heb. 4:12) For this reason we do well to include Bible reading in our regular theocratic schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Society appreciates the value of Bible reading. On one of its factory buildings is a large slogan, “Read God’s Word the Holy Bible Daily.” New members of the Bethel family are required to read the entire Bible during their first eight months at Bethel. True, they are kept busy putting in a full day’s work, attending congregation meetings and sharing in the field service. However, with a good schedule they are able to complete their Bible reading, as well as study others of the Society’s publications. After being at Bethel for eight months, they are encouraged to maintain a good schedule for continued Bible reada million more than last April. During this time you made a new peak of 3,720,232 back-calls. And the Bible studies that you conducted reached the highest number ever—352,032. All of this certainly demonstrates the love that you have for Jehovah and your earnest desire to help others to join in praising his glorious name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Many are responding to your efforts to help them. At the end of March when we had the fine public talk “Restoration of All Things of Which God Spoke,” 674,S02 persons were in attendance. And for the Memorial, on April 9, there were 901,195 persons present here in the U.S.A. What a great crowd! Just 4,596 of those present professed to ing. Some schedule time before breakfast, whereas others read the Bible while traveling on public transportation or before going to bed in the evening. Of course, the objective in reading the Bible is not just to be able to say, “I have read it.” Rather, we are desirous of establishing and maintaining a good relationship with Jehovah. We know that as we read his written Word we w’ill be able to grow in accurate knowledge, as well as increase oui’ faith.—Rom. 10:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> During June we are going to have the pleasure of offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Neiv World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> with the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font10"> We know from our own experience that these can be a real stimulus to meaningful Bible reading, so we will offer them enthusiastically.

<p><span class="font10">There will be many more studies to start during May and June with those who have shown interest this past month. And, of course, we are all making plans to be at the coming assemblies. We know that all of you are very busy. May your being fully occupied in the work of our loving Father always bring the greatest joy to your heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Note to congregation servant: One meeting in July will be left open, so you can adjust the program to allow for congregation’s attendance at district assembly. The week after the district assembly, part of the time on the service meeting can be used? to review high points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JUNE 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Increasing Appreciation for the Word of Life. Song 72.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Welcome and reading of text and comments. Also, Facts We Ought to Know About the Bible. Handled by questions and answers. Could have a few planned comments from audience, but for the most part it should be spontaneous expressions. Cover the following points (See April 15, 1971, “Watchtower,” pp. 227, 228.): How many books are there in the Bible? (Some are combined in Jewish versions: in some Bibles they are in different order. What is important is what books are included.) Is punctuation part of the Bible as originally written? What about chapter and verse divisions? When did Bible writing begin? When did it end? How many authors did it have? How many writers? In how many languages is the Bible available? Does that mean the entire Bible is available in all those languages? What is meant by “inspiration”? To w<sup>r</sup>hat extent did God provide details? By what means? What good reasons could you give someone for reading the Bible? (See chapter one of the “Word of God” book.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Advocating the Bible.’* Covered by questions and answers. Include demonstration of points in paragraphs 4 and 5, covering just the first part of the presentations. Interrupt presentations to let audience analyze why certain things are said or done. One acting as householder should do things realistically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Preparing for the Convention. (Cover material concerning the convention in the May 15, 1971, &quot;Watchtower,” also the June 8, 1971, “Awake!” Stimulate anticipation for it; encourage all to be present. Cover practical points of information that will be helpful to those attending a convention for the first time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">3 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Include Branch Letter and pertinent Announcements. Encourage regular Bible reading program. Consider Psalm 119:97. Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JUNE 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Loving Encouragement from Theocratic Counselors. Song 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Welcome, text and comments. Include encouragement to share in evening witnessing. If persons are not at home on weekends during summer, we cannot change their schedule, but can change ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: What Are We Going to Do This Summer? Handle this as a discussion among members of a family group. Include Presenting the Good News. Also, the article, “Can You Make Leisure Time Rewarding?” in the May 15, 1971, “W<sup>T</sup>atchtower.” There should be brief comments about attending an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Shepherd the Flock.” Audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Question Box. Handle as discussion between two book study servants. Do not merely state the points; enlarge on them and emphasize them so that they will be remembered and applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15. min: Facts W*e Ought to Know About the Bible. (Congregation servant; audience participation.) When was the first volume of the “New World Translation” released? On what Hebrew text is the Hebrew Scripture portion of that Bible based? What is the basis for the “New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures”? (“All Scripture Is Inspired . . . and Beneficial,” pp. 308, 309, 323-325) How was it originally determined which books belonged in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures? How was this determined for the Christian Greek Scriptures? What information does the Bible contain that otherwise would not be available to man? What is there about Bible history that wins one’s confidence? (Helpful information can be found in “Aid to Bible Understanding” under “Canon”; also under “Bible.” Also, see April 15, 1971, “Watchtower,” pp. 229, 230, and the “Word of God” book.) Appreciation of God’s Word stimulates us to zealous service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation is no doubt well acquainted with details of arrangements for meetings and field service. Therefore, meeting can be concluded by simply singing song 20, and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JUNE 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: While Acquiring Wisdom, Acquire Understanding. (Prov. 4:7) Song 113./4</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Weiconie', texf and comments. Include talk on the theme, for month, showing what it means in our lives as individuals. (See Feb. 15, 1970, “Watchtower.”) Discuss what wisdom is and what understanding is. What is the difference between acquiring these and simply finding answers to offer in meetings? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">fr/o //„ y</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Youfhs with Unbelieving Parents Praise Jehovah by Their Faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Chairman observes some unbelieving parents are indifferent to truth, others oppose it. Faithfulness vital for Christian youths in such homes. In divided home if father is indifferent, a fine way for younger children to stir up his interest is to ask him to read special articles for parents to read with children. Other methods suggested by experiences. (yb68, p. 150, par. 2; yb69, p. 148, par. 1, to p. 149, par. 2) Faithfulness may stir up interest. (yb68, p. 192, par. 1; p. 185, par. 2) What if there is opposition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) Demonstration. After meeting, servant speaks to two young publishers who seem dejected; parents oppose their serving Jehovah. Servant encourages them, stresses need for faithfulness, endurance. Jehovah will help them to endure. (yb71, p. 169, par. 1) If parents curtail youths’ theocratic activities, prayer, study and incidental witnessing available. (w70, p. 317, par. 10, 11) Youths express appreciation for encouragement and suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman reviews what can be done to aid unbelieving parents to see the truth, such as for youths to tell parents what they are learning. Main thing: Be faithful to Jehovah whether parents opposed or indifferent. (w70, p. 148, par. 6; yb70, p. 202, par. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on confidential matters, based on Questions from Readers in April 1, 1971, “Watchtower.” 15 min: Offer for July. Two families visiting together discuss the offer, how to handle objections, etc.; practice on each other. Interrupt presentation at appropriate points to get suggestions from audience as to what might be said or done, why it might be good to do things in a particular way, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include reminder to bring along June 8 “Awake!” and April 1 “Watchtower” next week. Encourage publishers to use older magazines where persons are not at home. Discuss with and draw comments from audience on (1) how’ we can sound down information from Bible into our own heart and (2) how the heart of children and interested persons can be reached. Consider Proverbs 4:4, 21. Song 87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JULY 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Showing Understanding by Wise Use of Time. Song 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Welcome, text and comments. Include any announcements that are needed regarding congregation’s activity here instead of at the end of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Family discussion of the article in June 8 “Awake!” on “Second Thoughts About a College Education.” 10 min: Theocratic News. Cover as discourse and with audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">27 min: Study with the congregation material in the April 1, 1971, “Watchtower” on “Blessings from Taking the Ministry Seriously.” Include experience from “1971 Yearbook” (p. 219, par. 1) as to not-at-home calls; apply this to local needs. Song 115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When the Circuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Servant Visits</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregations are growing, and in some places the increase has been such that three or four groups meet in the same hall. So, when the circuit servant visits, it may be necessary to make adjustments in the schedule for the week. For example, if another unit has its service meeting in the hall on Tuesday evening, there is no objection to the circuit servant’s having his first meeting with the entire congregation later in the week, probably on their regular service meeting night. This will avoid disrupting the other group’s program. He should still go through the congregation records on Tuesday afternoon. And, if possible, the congregation servant or his assistant should spend some time with him on that day, to work out details that need attention in connection with the week’s visit. The day and time at which meetings are held are not vital; what is important is that all the scheduled meetings be held during the week.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Shepherd</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> One thing Jehovah’s witnesses can give to their brothers that will often help more than anything else is encouragement. Even the brother who is doing excellently in every aspect of his Christian life needs it. Everyone likes to be assured that what he is doing is accomplishing something, also that it is appreciated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah in his wisdom has provided for that needed encouragement through shepherds appointed to care for his flock. The apostle Paul commanded the shepherd Timothy to ‘apply himself to exhortation.’ (1 Tim. 4:13) The Greek word that Paul used for “exhortation” is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">pa-ra'kle-sis,</span><span class="font10"> related to the word “paraclete” or “helper.” It can also be translated “encouragement.” Accordingly, servants have in mind giving whatever spiritual assistance may be needed, instead of a “pep” talk or “buildup” just to raise a brother’s field service averages. Attention is focused on building up spirituality by means of encouraging and assisting persons to read the Bible regularly along with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines and others of the Society’s publications. With appropriate spiritual assistance being given to fit the needs of an individual, there will not be any problem in getting support at the meetings or in the field ministry in view of what is stated at 2 Peter 1:8, will there?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Why is encouragement so much needed by all? Because everyone has his problems and his tests. When a servant meets a brother at the Kingdom Hall and asks him how he is doing, the brother will usually reply, “Fine.” And he may be doing well. But he may have problems and need some encouragement. He may be facing problems, big or small, every day in his secular work. Or he may be getting discouragement from relatives and associates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Again, it may be that he lacks joy because of not getting results from his service in the field. Yet this brother may never complain or say a word about it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Others may feel they are doing quite well, but, without suspecting the dangers involved, are becoming engulfed in a materialistic way of life. Or one may begin to be a complainer. Another may be walking on the borderline of loose conduct. Perhaps those knowing him well can see the danger or the snare imperiling him, although the brother himself does not clearly see it. —Gal. 6:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> These reasons make it vitally essential that the congregation ser-</span><span class="font3">Advocating the Bible &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">(Cottt’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">be obtained by just asking the person to get his Bible. Many persons will be pleased to show us a Bible for which they paid a large sum, or to talk to us about what they themselves have read, if they are Bible readers. We can still give our Scriptural presentation, using their Bible, can we not? And our real objective is to help them to read and understand the Bible, regardless of the translation, isn’t it? Why not try to start a home Bible study using their Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> To successfully advocate Bible reading, we need to understand why people have certain viewpoints or opinions. This requires that we get the householder to express himself early in our presentation. Let the person tell you whether he has a Bible, whether he feels it truly is the Word of God, etc. To encourage an expression from him, you may find it effective to say what he himself may be thinking, but is hesitant to tell you. You could say, “Many people have sincere questions about the Bible. They know that the Bible has been called God’s Word, but they</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It will be a great help to the Society if all publishers and pioneers place their orders for literature and renew personal subscriptions through the congregation rather than ordering direct from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregation servants: Have you ordered assembly lapel cards and badge holders yet? So that you will have your supply in sufficient time, be sure to order no later than four weeks before your district assembly begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ “Is the Truth Transforming Your Life?” is the title of the public talk that will be given by the circuit servants beginning September 5. At circuit assemblies the district servants will give the public talk “Can You Live Forever?—Will You?” </span><span class="font10">vant and book study servants, particularly, visit all the brothers, the strongest as well as the newest, in their homes. True, much encouragement can be given when we see our brothers at the Kingdom Hall or share in field service with them. But there is often much that cannot be accomplished in the limited time available on these occasions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> These servants must keep in mind their God-given responsibility to shepherd the flock. This they must do even if it costs them personal field service time. But then they are carrying out their duty and can expect Jehovah’s blessing. Actually, the brothers thus encour-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If., col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">wonder if there really is proof that it is from God.” Such an approach might encourage him to tell you how he feels. This will afford a good opportunity to direct attention to the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font10"> Offer it with the Bible. Of course, if he does not want both books, you may offer just the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font10"> book for 25 cents.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Generally it is necessary to get by common initial objections, such as “I am busy,” before making our Scriptural presentation. Some publishers do this effectively by, first, sympathizing with the householder and, second, inviting him to express himself. Try this for yourself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> When we are able to give our Scriptural presentation, we want to help persons to get the sense of the scriptures being considered. (Matt. 13:19) How can this best be done? After reading a scripture, instead of “telling” the person “the Bible says this or that,” why not ask questions to help him reason on what he has just read? Encourage him to express himself as to what he himself sees there in the Bible. If his heart is right, more than likely he will come to the same conclusions we have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> What everyone really needs is the truth that is found in the Bible. That is what we advocate, isn’t it? We do it by our example, by the literature we offer and by encouraging others to listen to the good things contained in God’s Word.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Vacation Pioneer This Summer</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>The summer season is here! For many this affords a fine opportunity to join the ever-increasing ranks of vacation pioneers. Will you be one of them?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For at least two months during summer, schools are on their vacation period. Parents, can you arrange family affairs so that one or more of your young ones can vacation pioneer? Perhaps some can do it for two weeks, others for a month or two. It may be that one parent, or both, can join in doing the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Vacation pioneering means spending less than half a day in the field service for two weeks, a month or more. And that leaves much time for other things, including wholesome recreation. (Eccl. 3:1, 4) Many young publishers vacation pioneer each summer, having in mind their goal of regular pioneer, missionary or Bethel service upon completing their schooling. Would not such a balanced schedule bring great satisfaction? Those who have already vacation pioneered answer “Yes!” And, does not being a vacation pioneer bring a feeling of accomplishment, as well as help us to improve our ability to present the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For example, a publisher in Tennessee writes: “I cannot begin to express the benefits and joys that have come to me from vacation pioneering. But I appreciate at least four: first, thoughts and scriptures come to mind easier through increased use; second, spending much more time giving out the pure waters of truth brings greater happiness; third is the joy in finding and feeding more people and increasing the number of Bible studies I conduct ; and last, vacation pioneering acts as a spiritual ‘shot in the arm’ to build me up for the months following.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Others note that their teaching ability has improved and that they are better able to overcome objections and get Bible studies started since having vacation pioneered. It also has drawn them closer to other publishers in the congregation .since they can spend more time working with them in the ministry. As one said: “This builds up a relationship that doesn’t terminate at the end of the month.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you are newly baptized, can you share in this fine feature of service? Yes, you can right after baptism if you have published regularly for six months and have a reputation for good Christian conduct. And if you are not yet baptized? Well, why not go along with others who vacation pioneer this summer to get more experience, building toward the day when you do qualify.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> So, can you vacation pioneer this summer? Why not talk things over in the congregation and in your family? Most important of all, speak to Jehovah in prayer on this important matter. Many who vacation pioneer find that, as a result, they learn to rely more completely on Jehovah. They realize to a fuller extent the truthfulness of the words: “O Jehovah of armies, happy is the man that is trusting in you.” —Ps. 84:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">aged will be impelled by God’s spirit to spend many more hours in proclaiming the good news, and these will be joyful, effective hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Such visits are not made merely to increase a brother’s field service. They should be truly friendly calls, with genuine interest in the brother’s overall welfare. The object is to get better acquainted, to better appreciate our brothers, as to what they do and the problems they face. Then, when help and encouragement are needed, the servant can give what is needed with real understanding. If the brothers are built up spiritually, they will be better representatives of true worship in every feature of their lives—their homelife, their conduct, their love and their share in encouraging others with the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> Furthermore, the servants themselves will be spared many problems that may otherwise come up. The spiritual tone and health of the congregation will be much better. Moreover, the servants themselves will benefit greatly from the interchange of encouragement.—Rom. 1:12.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">y^uestion &amp;5ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">® What can be done in field service so the rest of those in a car group do not spend their time waiting for the one making a call?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First, it would be good to adjust the size of the car group to fit the type of territory to be worked. If houses are widely scattered, having just a few publishers in the car will make it easier to keep everyone busy working. If a large number of publishers are going in service, small car groups can be organized, with each group having its own territory. This will cut down on travel in working the territory initially, and later on when back-calls and not-at-home calls are made, will it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When homes are far apart, the car driver can leave publishers off at the houses, and then after calling on a home himself, return to pick them up. When homes are closer together, publishers might walk to the next houses. This is making better use of service time than would waiting in the car. And besides, the walking may do us good physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Similar suggestions can be applied to car-group back-call work in cities. Two or three smaller car groups are usually preferable to one large group. When possible, areas can be. visited where others in the group have back-calls within walking distance. Or, if no one else has back-calls in the vicinity, someone in the group may have not-at-homes nearby that can be worked. Perhaps the person who has the back-call to make can provide not-at-homes for others to do, since that one may have recently been working the territory. Yet gnother possibility is for others to get out of the car while the back-call is being made and talk to persons passing by. Thus each one can be helped to have a full share in talking to others about God’s kingdom.</span></p>

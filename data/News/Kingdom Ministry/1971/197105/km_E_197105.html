<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 1971 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;••You will be witnesses of me ... to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1: 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>x,v NO</sup>- <sup>5</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font10">All of you hard workers in the field throughout the United States keep those of us at Bethel very excited. Our excitement is one of joy and we wonder what to expect next. You have produced five new publisher peaks so far this service year, with March hitting 409,413! Our mail is flooded with requests for a share in the vacation pioneer work. We have sent out over 35,000 appointments for April. And the Initial printing of April’s special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines is over ten million copies in English alone. It certainly should prove to be a marvelous month for witnessing. Of course, we are always anxious to see what that report will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are a few other interesting figures that we saw when cheeking \ over things in the office. So far this I service year 110 more congregations have been inaugurated in the United States. There are now 69 congregations in Chicago, 96 in Los Angeles, 30 in Miami, and here in New York city we have 209. Everywhere you turn, things are growing fast. Right now we have at least 5,605 congregations in the United States. It is no wonder that we are working day and night at the factory keeping all of you supplied with literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now in just a little while the “Divine Name” Assembly will begin, and this will be a five-day assembly. The Society must have something very important for us, because they have arranged for us to gather together for five days. Be sure to bring all of your family and those with whom you are studying. By all means try to make arrangements for them to get to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Watchtower Farm things are moving ahead well. They have just about finished the new printing plant. The people from whom we are buying printing presses failed to send us the presses on time because of strikes and a lack of raw materials. However, we are using the plant right now for a carpenter, electric and plumbing shop and sleeping quarters for those working</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE TRUTH BOOK </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Can Help to Build a Healthy Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Of which bound book have you placed the most in recent years? Is it the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book? For many of us it is. When the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book was released at the “Good News for All Nations” District Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1968, its first printing amounted to 1,500,000 copies. Today, in 1971, this outstanding Bible study aid is being printed and distributed in 67 languages and the latest figures indicate that 35,000,000 copies have been printed. That is about one copy for every 100 persons in the world. And the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">book is a publication you enjoy offering in the ministry, isn’t it? —because it is easy to understand, it considers practical subjects and on the new Bethel home that we have started to construct. So the building is in full use while we are waiting for our presses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">If you are passing by Watchtower Farm, which is near Pine Bush, New York, you will see a lot of activity. You may find it convenient to drive by when going to the Yankee Stadium assembly or homeward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, as we said, there is a lot of excitement. It keeps us very happy here. The Bethel Family is delighted with their privileges of service, and we are glad to be doing so much to help our brothers in the United States and throughout the world. Like you, we are looking forward to the assemblies this summer, and some of us will see some of you at the “Divine Name” Assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with you as all of us press on with the work of preaching during these delightful days, using all means to keep “healthy in faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">P.S.: Just received New York city’s Memorial report for 209 congregations. 50,361 attended. Isn’t that something—a 13.5-percent increase! 258 partook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">it is such a fine publication to use in the Bible study work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During May it will be our pleasure to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book to the people in our territory, our friends, relatives and acquaintances as we seek to help them to grow healthy in the faith needed in these critical days. Offer it to persons who subscribed for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> Encourage them to obtain, read and study a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">book. They will be greatly benefited if they do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> You may continue using the same Scriptural presentation we used during the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign if you wish. (See the December 1970 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> page 2.) Or, you may present the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book in some other way if you wish. If you are having good success with the theme “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems,” you will find that this ties in nicely with Chapter 12 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, “Righteous Rule Makes Earth a Paradise.” Notice how the first few sentences in the chapter tie in with your theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If some individuals already have a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, feel free to offer other publications of the Society, such as the Word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of God </span><span class="font10">or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book, or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> But especially try to start a study. Sometimes all it takes is an expression of pleasure over the fact that the householder has a copy and then a kindly inquiry : ‘May I show you something in the book that was very interesting to me?’ Then you can read them a paragraph or two on a subject that particularly appeals to you. You can look up the scriptures cited, to show how these provide further enlightenment on the subject. One sister, when observing that the householder has learned a new point, will often say: ‘Isn’t It interesting! Would you like to read </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) Demonstration: Father and mother review situations that might arise to test integrity of children in school. (Consider also temptations from schoolmates to do bad.) Turning to “1971 Yearbook,” father snows how standing firm for godly principles serves as a witness. (Page 214, 113) Mother mentions that standing firm helps other Witness children. (Page 93, 1J4; page 94, ffl) Father draws attention to fact that good conduct is part of matter and leads to witness. (Page 175, 1J2) Children encouraged, determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Chairman shows that enduring trials makes one stronger and more determined to obey God. (Page 228, 113; page 306, 113) Consider local experiences and holidays coming up (Memorial Day) that require standing firm for godly principles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Work with Counselors of the New Order Society. Song 102.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">12 min: How Are Our Brothers Working in Africa? See reports in “The Watchtower,” February 15 and March 1, 1971, and “Awake!”, March 22, 1971.

<p><span class="font9">13 min: Working with Magazines to Spread the Good News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: Report on how the congregation is doing and commend brothers for activity with magazines. Ask congregation to suggest occasions for presenting magazines: When offer is not taken, incidental witnessing, etc. Some carry them in pocket or purse and offer them when shopping, at gas station, on train or bus, to fellow employees, at school, to salesmen who call at the home, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage publishers always to carry magazines in the ministry and use them well. There is no objection to leaving an older magazine (just one, either “Watchtower” or “Awake!”) and a handbill where people are not home, especially if the magazine can be put under the door or through some open slot for receiving packages. Do not use mail receptacles. Extra magazines that are not current may be used in this way or given free to people who cannot afford to give a contribution. Good experiences have resulted from this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As you help new publishers to be regular in the ministry, each week if possible, invite them to come with^ you and share in magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Prepare according to local needs.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> With increasing pressures on everyone during the last days of his old system of things, there is 'Un ever-continuing need for all of Jehovah’s people to stay strong spiritually—strong In their love for Jehovah, his service, his organization and their brothers. Another person cannot do this for us. We individually must put forth the effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How often is it that the brothers have encouraged us in talks at the Kingdom Hall to be regular in personal study and family study? Perhaps one has visited your home to give practical help along this line. We appreciate this encouragement and assistance from our brothers. It is apparent that they desire to see us keep alive spiritually. While we know that the servants will continue to assist others in this way, could YOU help someone else to be more regular in personal or family, study ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Some very helpful suggestions were given recently in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> to assist us in personal study. Have you read the articles “How Can You Find Joy in Personal Study?” and “Effective Use of Study Time Brings Joy,” which appeared in the January 15 and February 1, 1971, issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower? </span><span class="font10">Are you applying the suggestions</span></p></li></ul>

Two or more should be prepared to work together. In all cases a serviceable car will be required. The Society will provide some financial assistance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ It is suggested that, as much as possible, the congregations in New England should plan to attend the convention in New York city rather than Canada so as not to overcrowd the facilities there.</span></p>

Perhaps you could read them with another publisher and help him to apply them and benefit from them too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Many parents are now regularly conducting family studies and their families are growing stronger spiritually as a result. Is this true of your family? Have you read the article &quot;Family Study a Blessing&quot; in the February 15, 1971, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower?</span><span class="font10"> If so, no doubt you found the suggestions given to be most helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If your family still needs to get into this good routine, could you decide together as a family this week what time would be best? If some need to make adjustments in their schedule to make room for the family study, then this would be a wise thing to do. Sometimes parents have decided it would be well to have a short session, just twenty or thirty minutes. Then, as the family gets used to the schedule and interest grows, the study sessions can be lengthened when this is advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> Then there is the question: ‘What shall we study?’ Some families are reading the Bible together. Each takes his turn to read a paragraph. After each paragraph is read, the family is free to make comments or ask questions. Thus each member of the family has a part and is benefited greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Some are studying a few paragraphs (or all of them) for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The report for March is excellent! It was another month marked with new peaks. Outstanding was the report of 409,413 publishers! That represents a 10.2-percent increase over last year’s average, and an increase of 34,535 publishers since last March. Isn't that thrilling!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is apparent that you were busy during the month gathering together the newly interested ones for the special public talk and the Memorial, because back-calls went up to a new peak of 3,333,634. That is 490,843 more than the preceding month, and it is a fine indication of the loving interest that you have in these sheeplike persons.</span></p>

Some find that variety in the study is good and so spend twenty minutes preparing a few paragraphs for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study, twenty minutes or so studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book or other appropriate publication and twenty minutes or so discussing or practicing presentations for the field service.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> To encourage research and increase interest in personal study, some parents are encouraging their children to select a subject they are interested in from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index,</span><span class="font10"> read the article referred to in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font10"> and then give a brief report on it to the family.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> There have been occasions where publishers have completed a study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book with interested people in less than six months. You may have experienced this too. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1911 yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> on page 207, mentions a lady from Mexico who came in contact with the truth through a gift subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> Learning of the circuit assembly, she traveled some distance to attend. The district servant and his wife noted her sincere interest and her desire to help the people in her small village to learn the truth. Because this interested person would be in the city only a short time and then would be flying back to her village in the mountains, an intensive study program was arranged for her. During the week they studied for thirty hours. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book was completed, and when the interested woman returned to her isolated village she was better prepared to help others. In fact, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> reported that she was conducting eight studies and that fifteen of these were attending the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study being conducted in that isolated area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Isn’t an experience like that encouraging? And doesn’t it motivate you to urge interested ones to study the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book and then to begin to act on what they learn from God’s Word? As we all have a full share in the field ministry during May we are confident that Jehovah will bless us in our efforts to use the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book to help others build a healthy faith.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It is a pleasure to report that Bible study activity is on the upswing. During the months of January through March you brothers succeeded in starting and conducting 35,040 more studies than you reported in December. At the end of March you were conducting 25,766 more studies than you were during March a year ago. Many congregations now are averaging one or more studies per publisher. We all rejoice to see these evidences of Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is true, of course, that many who obtain literature do not respond favorably to our offer of the study arrangement. We often find that the hearts of these people are on other things and, as we learned from our study of the March 1 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> It Is the heart that motivates them as well as us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> There are many things that cause people to change their thinking and their desires, however. It may be the death of a close friend or relative, or a change in one’s financial situation or personal circumstances. It may be your regular visits in the ministry. Many are becoming disgusted with this old system of things. .Yes, many people are changing their thinking and changing their desires, and we want to be on hand at the appropriate time to help them and to direct their minds and hearts to Jehovah’s Word and his new system of things, don’t we? This is one reason for us to continue to have as full and regular a share in the house-to-house work as possible. In the house-to-house work we are keeping God's Word before the people and we are watching for those upon whom God’s Word makes a favorable impression so as to motivate them to righteousness. We plant and water the seeds of truth and look to Jehovah to make it grow.—1 Cor. 3: 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* One circuit servant observed that, in many cases, it was the publishers who showed ‘continued effort and sheer determination’ who, with Jehovah’s blessing, succeeded in getting Bible studies started. Many are finding that rehearsing and practicing how they will handle things has increased their effectiveness in getting new studies started. Have you been following the good suggestions presented on Saturday evening at your circuit assembly and on page 8 of the February </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry?</span><span class="font10"> It may be that your preparing in advance in this way will help you to get a study started too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> During the week of the circuit servant’s visit the circuit servant and his pioneer wife, if he is married, have as a goal starting two or more home Bible studies and turning these over to publishers and pioneers in the congregation. Would you be willing to follow through and regularly conduct one of these studies? Tell the circuit servant of your willingness. With the efforts of the pioneer wife of a circuit servant to start studies, and the conscientious follow-through of the zealous publishers who regularly conducted the studies turned over to them, thirty persons in one circuit are now publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>a</sup> When interest is located and studies are started, keep in mind the fine suggestions given on page 2 of the January </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">to aid us to protect these interested ones, strengthen their hearts and ‘keep Bible studies going.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> As you put forth an effort to start new Bible studies, pray that Jehovah will bless you In your efforts. Work with others who are having success in the work. Endeavor to make progress. Continue to exert yourselves vigorously. Yes, “let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out”—Gal. 6:9.</span></p>

But you can be sure that the reading and research will be beneficial and equip them for research on more vital subjects in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Will it Ite with you and your family as Jehovah said of Abraham? He taught ‘his sons and his household so that they should keep Jehovah’s way.’ (Gen. 18:19) Keep yourselves strong spiritually now. If you do, then, with Jehovah’s blessing, you and your family have the happy prospect of being alive together and strong spiritually in Jehovah’s new system of things too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• When assigned rooms by the convention rooming department, what should you do if you cannot accept the assignment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When rooming assignments are made for the convention the householder is advised of the name, address and date of arrival of the ones assigned and you are likewise advised of the name and address of the householder. Many householders purchase linens, fix up the rooms, rearrange their own families for sleeping, etc., for those coming, and they have a right to expect them to be there. If for some good reason you have to change your plans and cannot accept the assignment, then you must advise the householder as well as the convention rooming department of this. Otherwise, since Christians are true to their word, you would actually owe the householder the money for the room if you had not informed him of the change in plans in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Does the same principle hold true in regard to accepting volunteer service assignments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yes. Christians are honest in all things, and it is only proper to advise the volunteer service department if plans have to be changed and you are unable to fulfill your assignment.</span></p>

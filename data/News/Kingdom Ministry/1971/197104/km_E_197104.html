<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)ea/i ^Kingcfoin ^JWislieftS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Since we wrote you last month. Brother Knorr has returned to Bethel from his service tour through Africa and Europe. He told us some of the heartwarming experiences that occurred along the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Flying between points in Africa, lie had an experience that, as lie put it, made him think of the angelic help we have. Obliged to lay over for a while at the airport in Cameroon, where our brothers have been, severely persecuted, he was approached by a man asking, “Are you Nathan II. Knorr?” When he replied that lie was, the man extended his hand, saying, “I am your brother.” Another brother, a congregation servant, was witli him. Tlie two brothers just happened to be there at the airport, having no idea ithat Brother Knorr would be passing through. They were delighted to ‘'receive news from the “outside,” inasmuch as no literature had arrived for some months. A thrilling experience indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brother Knorr also reported that our brothers in Malawi now enjoy relative peace. Though there is still a ban on our work, if anyone physically molests the Witnesses, the molester is the one who is severely punished by the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As you know, the Kingdom activity in Spain can at last be done in a public manner. During his visit there Brother Knorr was able to speak to 14,569 in meetings in Madrid and Barcelona. The brothers in Barcelona were so happy that, after singing a song together, they burst into spontaneous applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On March 7 we here at Bethel saw the fiftieth class of Gilead graduate. Now over 5,000 students have completed that schooling, and the ones from this last class are on their way to nineteen lands for missionary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We live in grand times. May we all share fully in the work to be done, always preaching God’s kingdom with the right viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">What Will the Memorial Move You to Do?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a heartwarming occasion the Memorial is! It does us so much good to spend that time concentrating our thoughts on the one whom God has made our Lord and Savior, reviewing what God has done for us through him. As we sit there we may think of this great earthly globe turning on its axis and how congregations to the east of us have already met together, while those to the west of us will soon be doing the same, so that God’s people spread over the face of the earth are all doing the same thing as we are doing, all on the same night. It draws us together in a special way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> And what is it that stays with us after the Memorial celebration ends? True, we feel very elated when the number present is large, as it so often is. Just think, last year more than 3,226,000 persons attended world wide. This is so encouraging, for it indicates God’s blessing on us. But, stimulating though such a big attendance may be, tlie main thing in our memory should be, and undoubtedly is: what our Lord Jesus Christ did in fulfillment of his Father’s purpose. We met together ‘in remembrance of him.’—1 Cor. 11:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> So we sincerely want our tongues to be among those that “openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:10, 11) During April how can we be sure of doing this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Daily we want to live good, clean, wholesome lives, demonstrating that we do, indeed, know God’s Son and imitate him. We want to show love for our mates and families in all ways, but, above all, in spiritual things. And, “as long as we have time favorable for it,” we want to work “what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) We want to use our tongues to upbuild our brothers and sisters, encourage them in right works, so that their tongues continue acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord. Visit them, converse with them, invite them to share with you in meeting together and in declaring the good news of God’s kingdom together. Show the same warm love for them that God’s Son showed for his disciples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Certainly we also want to remember God’s Son by showing compassion like his for those on the outside, those not “related to us in the faith.” Today as never before they are truly “sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9: 36) How good to have the fine special issues of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines to bring to them right in their homes or anywhere else where we have opportunity to talk with them. And how much easier it is for us to interest them because of having such timely material as the article on the “Restoration of All Things of Which God Spoke” in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> material on “Earth’s Future—Garbage Dump or Garden Home?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Some of these persons now study with us In home Bible studies. They indicate they want to become part of God’s great family, to be under the headship of our Lord. Since tlie start of the service year last September, thousands of such persons throughout the land have spent as much as six months in Bible study. Are they now ready to use their tongues in acknowledging Christ Jesus as Lord to still others? Doubtless many will welcome your invitation to join with you in sharing the word of life with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> What of those who are not yet ready? We who study with these may be reminded by the Memorial to discuss the meaning of Christian discipleship so that they appreciate</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Telling Schoolmates God’s Good News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: Outside of classroom sessions there are many opportunities for school-age witnesses to tell schoolmates God’s good news. Lunch time and walking to and from school offer fine opportunities. Often simply a matter of seizing these opportunities. Seek Jehovah’s help in prayer if shy about telling good news to schoolmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(7 mln.) Demonstration. Young brother and sister approach book study servant. Both are shy, little fearful about being chided or ridiculed if they tell schoolmates good news. Servant turns to “1971 Yearbook” and considers experience of one who felt as they do. (p. 150, par. 1) Servant asks if they have taken literature to school. By doing so, you can show classmates what you enjoy reading; schoolmates may want copies, (p. 165, par. 3) Also If students wonder about or ask questions on certain matters, show them what God says in the Bible about such. (p. 245, par. 3) Servant mentions that timeliness of special &quot;Awake!” will interest many students. Two youths now determined to tel! schoolmates God’s good news.</span></p>

(1 Sam. 15:22; Deut. 10:12, 13; Acts 5:29) What does our obedience to God’s Word demonstrate? Is the Christian obligation to keep the commands of God a restrictive burden, or how should it be viewed? (1 John 5:2, 3; Ps. 112:1; Rom. 16:26) What results come from obedience and from disobedience?

<p><span class="font10">Generally the Society estimates the number in attendance at each assembly bn the basis that normally brothers attend an assembly nearest to their homes.

If the suggestions noted below are followed, it Will greatly aid in making the facilities more comfortable for all in attendance, both by having ample seating and less congestion in every way. So, for the following circuits, we suggest that, as much as possible, they attend the conventions noted below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">That People May Be Free</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a wonderful feeling to be free, free from Satan’s religious bondage! That’s the way all of Jehovah’s people feel, and we believe that you’ll agree that the magazines have had much to do with our gaining our freedom. Our hearts thrilled at the account of the Buddhist woman who read </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and as a result broke free from that demon-istic religion. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> Feb. 22, 1971, pp. 23-26) And do you recall reading of the Catholic man in Canada who found a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">in the wastebasket and, after reading It, said, “My whole outlook on life now changed”? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(1911 Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">p. 100) These are now our fellow workers. You can be sure they appreciate the value of magazine activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What have you found that helps you most to place magazines? It is true, is it not, that having a good knowledge of what is in the magazines is the key? That means reading them over as soon as they come and talking about the articles with others at home or those we work with in the service. When we get enthusiastic about what we read, it is reflected as we talk to people we meet in the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When it comes to the actual presentation, it is good to have specific articles in mind for the different types of people we meet so that we can point to information that is particularly appealing to them. For example, a mother with young children could be directed to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article for children and shown how these articles can be used to implant principles in their minds to defend them against the corrupting Influences in school. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">pp. 181, 214) Likely on magazine day you work from house to house, but have you tried offering the magazines to people you meet as you walk down the street on the way to the territory? Many do this, with excellent success. What about regular street work? We know of many pioneers and publishers who find that they can easily place magazines on busy street corners near shopping areas or at bus stops or, in fact, wherever there are people. The effect of magazine street work can be seen in what happened in New Britain, where fourteen persons started to study after one of them had obtained some magazines and then shared with the others what he had learned. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">p. 237) In New York several brothers have started studies with people they have met in street work. They have found it best to walk up to people, draw them into conversation, then offer the magazines and, when appropriate, the folder advising interested ones of the free arrangement to study the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Do you have a magazine route? If not, and you would like to start one, you may wish to follow the example of a pioneer in California. His route helps him to average placement of 395 magazines a month. When householders take magazines, he says, “Would yon like to have these magazines regularly? They are only 20c a month, and I will be glad to deliver them.” A magazine route also offers a wonderful potential for starting studies or getting subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If, despite all your fine efforts, some magazines do accumulate, these older issues can be used. One copy can be left free when no one Is at home and then a special effort can be made to return to get the householder’s response. ■ A pioneer in England is having good results from calling back on such placements and you may too.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">p. 95.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> There are millions more in religious bondage who need to be free. We have the instruments to free them and we know that they can produce dramatic results in a person’s life. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> p. 200) So, let’s place magazines at every opportunity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Through &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">now. Whether they renew or not, try to upbuild them spiritually and, if possible, encourage'them to have a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In following through, help people to see the advantage of having something faith strengthening from Jehovah’s Word coming into their homes on a regular basis. Let’s take advantage of every opportunity to obtain subscriptions in this final month of the campaign.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font9">• What are the qualifications for Bethel service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First of all, it is necessary that the individual have a deep love for Jehovah, his Word and his organization, as well as a strong desire to serve his Christian brothers around the world. Applicants agree to serve at Bethel for at least four years and work hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most of the work at Bethel is best cared for by brothers, so the primary need at Bethel is for single brothers between 17 and 35 years of age. Those who apply must be dedicated and baptized for at least a year. Brothers invited to Bethel are usually chosen from applicants who are regular or special pioneers arid who have received a minister’s (IV-D) draft classification, or one exempting them from call. Brothers who apply for Bethel service should be in good health and able to work hard, as there is much to be done at the Society’s headquarters and farms with the rapid expansion of Jehovah’s organization world wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Single sisters and married couples with no children may also apply. Individuals who do not qualify for Bethel service for one reason or another should not feel discouraged, as there is also plenty to be done in the full-time field work. Any persons between 17 and 35 years of age in good health and who like to work hard may see the circuit servant when he next visits the congregation or they may write to Office of the President, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.—See also &quot;Lamp&quot; book, pages 205-208.</span></p>

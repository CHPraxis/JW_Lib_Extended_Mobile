</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">^Dea* ^PuWiskts:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The United States branch report for tiie past service year has just been compiled, and what a glorious year it lias been in making known Jehovah's name and fame! We are happy to have this opportunity to share with you some of the highlights. It is a most excellent report. Of course, you'll want to read all the details when they are published in the forthcoming </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We all have a certain feeling of satisfaction when new peaks are reached, do we not? Well, this year’s report shows peaks in publishers, back-calls, Bible studies, hours, magazines and subscriptions. Just think of it, on the average there were 402,893 publishers! This is 31,332 more than last year. April’s peak was 416,789.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To us who have been serving Jehovah for many years this average of 402,893 publishers, just for the United States, is very impressive. We can recall that only twenty years ago there were not even that many publishers of the good news in the whole world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of us worked hard, too, getting 1.587,819 new subscriptions, making 35,659,580 back-calls, and averaging 310,449 home Bible studies. Results? Well, if we consider the number baptized as tangible results, then all previous records were shattered with 40,336 being immersed in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This growth in publishers means that more are attending at our Kingdom Halls. So it was necessary to form 242 new congregations. Now there are 5,676 congregations in the 48 states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is something else these figures show tiiat gives us reasons to rejoice. They reflect our growth in spirituality and appreciation. They show that we really count it a privilege to serve Jehovah, and to show loving concern for our fellowman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were also some new peaks in both regular and vacation pio-\peers. 89,660 vacation pioneer appointments were made during the t year, a figure that is up from last</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">OUR CONCERN</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In the little time that remains, our concern is to take advantage of all opportunities to declare Jehovah’s name and to help others to become disciples. What can we do during October to show our concern in this regard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This month we have special issues of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> magazines to use in our ministry. Something “special” is “distinguished by some unusual quality”; it is “unique,” &quot;extra” and year's 78,857 by 10,803. This, too, we can say reflects spiritual growth on the part of many in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other figures in the annual report that make us happy include the coverage of unassigned or isolated territory. Whereas in 1950 there were 1,535 such territories, many of which were seldom worked, these have now been reduced to 359. Most gratifying too is the fact that all of these territories were assigned to be worked this past summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, the country as a whole received a mighty witness. Can you imagine what a mountain of literature was distributed? Besides tens of millions of handbills and tracts, we placed 101,544,327 books, booklets, Bibles and magazines. Why, that is one or more Bible study helps for every household in the whole country!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All in all, it was a tremendous service year and we are looking forward to many new peaks in the months ahead. The potential is there, for although there was a peak of 416,789 publishers, the total attendance during a six-month period at circuit assembly public meetings was 619,904—a difference of more than 200,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the short remaining time let us, with Jehovah’s help and blessing, continue aiding these persons also to know the God who deserves their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“designed for a particular purpose or occasion.” Our special magazines this month are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all of these things and more,</span><span class="font10"> for they will be instrumental in aiding many world wide to become disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “Relief from Today’s Pressures —How?” is the appealing title of the October 8 issue, and this special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> contains information that will bring refreshment and comfort to all w’ho read it. It will be easy to arouse interest in the subject. People today are tense and feel the pressures of this wicked system of things. This is true whether people are young or old, rich or poor, regardless of race or nationality. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> shows them the real solution and how to benefit from it. Offer it to everyone you meet— whether from house to house or elsewhere—along with the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> which contains the inspiring district assembly public talk, “When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God.” From fulfillment of Bible prophecy we know that this time draws near and that people do not have much time left to learn of Jehovah’s loving provisions for salvation. Our concern is to make known that only Jehovah deserves our worship and to help those persons who want to lie helped in the time that remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What is happening in the world today is a source of deep concern to sincere persons. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> can help them because it analyzes the problems, of life and gives a sound basis for hope for the future, a hope based on God’s own Word. During October, at every opportunity let’s offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> on a contribution of $1.50. Three free booklets will be given to new subscribers. If you desire, you may offer a year’s subscription for both magazines, with six booklets, for $3. Remember, these magazines are two of the most widely circulated magazines in the world, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Showing Concern for Others. Song </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Introduction, text comments and appropriate Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Branch Letter and Theocratic News items,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Use Booklets or Magazine Articles to Start Studies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) In addition to obtaining subscriptions, which will mean that the magazines go regularly to a home, our desire is to aid interested ones, where possible, through a Bible study. Articles in the magazines may be used to start studies. Also booklets are excellent for starting studies. In fact, thousands in the truth today first studied in the &quot;Look!&quot; or &quot;Good News” booklet. Both booklets are well designed for starting studies. It would be well to include one or both of these booklets among the three booklets given to new subscribers. On the initial call or return visit, here is how the &quot;Look!” booklet has been effectively used to start a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) Publisher draws attention to the cover of the booklet, how it pictures mankind free from pressures. While householder looks at cover of booklet, from his own copy publisher reads pertinent parts of pars. 1-4. making appropriate comments, asking questions to draw householder into discussion. Thereafter householder is invited to get his copy of Bible to look up together various scriptures on bottom of page 4. After discussing some scriptures, arrangements are made to return and continue discussion of Bible with use of booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Discuss how articles in magazines can be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publishers may be reminded of the suggestion to start studies using &quot;Good News&quot; booklet, as found in February 1971 &quot;Kingdom Ministry&quot; under &quot;Presenting the Good News.&quot; (Study can be transferred to &quot;Truth&quot; book whenever appropriate.) Practice sessions at home or with other publishers have helped many to prepare and to have confidence to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If time permits, have some encouraging local experiences dealing with starting studies or sharing in Bible study work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: &quot;Our Concern.” Question-and-answer discussion of main article. Demonstrate subscription offer, also magazine presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding remarks, including Psalm 119:97. Cover slogan at bottom of page 8. Song 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Making Advancement Manifest. (1 Tim. 4:15) Song 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 mm: Question Box. Publisher applying for vacation pioneer service discusses material with the literature servant,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">18 min: Presenting the Good News. One or two book study conductors and magazine-territory servant discuss material. Demonstrate points, making suggestions practical to local congregation’s territory. Tie in subscription offer and use of special issues of magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding remarks. Discuss thoughts from article &quot;God Wisely Selects Earth's Rulers,” as found in September 15, 1971, &quot;Watchtower.” Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Love Identifies True Christians. (John 13:35) Song 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: &quot;Make Them Feel Welcome.” Question-and-answer coverage, with points demonstrated, such as how person newly attending meeting can be approached and made to feel welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Local experiences on the joys resulting from placing the special issues, obtaining subscriptions starting studies and/or other points or interest. 20 min: Settling Difficulties in Love. Audience participation. Proportion and watch timing so all points are covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why do difficulties between Christians sometimes arise? (Ps. 51:5; 2 Tim. 3:1; w65, pp. 296, 297) If one is sinned against or offended, should one think of getting even or should one quit talking to the offender? (ms 446; Matt. 5:23, 24; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5) If one is sinned against, offended or otherwise experiences difficulties, what would be a loving thing to consider? (Allow for several comments here, including comments on scriptures in references. Summarize main points, ms 446; w65, p. 298, par. 7; w67, pp. 461-463; w69, p. 560, par. 7) If one feels unable to overlook and forgive an offense, or a difficulty has not been settled, what could one do? (ms 446; Matt. 18:15; w65, p. 299, par. 8; w’66, p. 492, par. 3; w68, p. 530, par. 13; w69, p. 561, par. 8) If one does find it necessary to take the step suggested at Matt. 18:15, what should be the motive of the offended one, and with what results at times? (ms 447; Luke 17:3, 4; 1 Pet. 4:8; w65, pp. 299, 300, pars. 9, 10; w70, p. 390) If serious difficulty is not settled &quot;between you and him alone,&quot; what next may be done, and what should be the motive of all concerned? (Matt. 18:16; w65, pp. 300, 301, pars. 11-13) Why are love and God’s spirit important in settling difficulties? To what does this lead? (1 Cor. 13:8, 13; Gal. 5:22, 23; w65, p. 301, par. 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding remarks. Song 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Display Christlike Obedience Under Test. (Heb. 5:8) Song 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Introduction, text and comments, also talk on month’s service theme. (See &quot;Watchtower” of September 15, 1970.) Discuss how Christ &quot;learned obedience” under test and why this was beneficial for him; also, wherein all earth's inhabitants are being tested, how we can prove our obedience under this test, and how day-to-day obedience aids us when faced with a severe test,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: For Us! Two or three teenagers discuss article in September 1, 1971, &quot;Watchtower&quot; on &quot;Building for the Future During Youth,” especially designed for them, about them and their problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Let Them Know in November.” Audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Helping Others to Know Jehovah. Discuss and demonstrate how to present the new book &quot;&nbsp;‘The</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nations Shall Know that I Am Jeho- <sub>k </sub>vah’—Bow?” A presentation such as the following might be used: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Know Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I am glad to find you at home. I am calling to talk briefly with persons who are concerned about the conditions in the world. Conditions are not good, are they? [Briefly cite an example.] What do you believe the difficulty is? [Let householder comment.] One of the basic problems is that there is so much hatred. People lack love; they so often think only of themselves, isn't that so? The Bible explains why this situation exists. [Read 1 John 4:8.] Do people really know God? When getting acquainted with someone, one of the first things you learn is his name. But do people know who God is? Even most church members never use his name. But notice what it says here in Psalm 83:18. [Read it.] So, what is God’s name? [Allow for comment.] Notice that it is important to know, not only his name, but also that he is the Most High. That means that his purpose cannot fail. He has promised to destroy the wicked and to make this earth a Paradise for those who love him and their fellowman. Would you like to live then? [Allow for comment.] If so, now is the time to get to know Jehovah and how his purpose affects you. That is why we are offering this new book <sup>4</sup> &quot;The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”— How?’ It discusses the entire Bible book of Ezekiel -and what it means to us. The book is yours, with this booklet, for 50' cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the householder interrupts after your introduction and says that he is too busy or is not interested, you « might say: &quot;Well, at least I would like you to know that I am offering to everyone this fascinating new book ’ &quot;The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah&quot;—How?’ I would like to leave you a copy for just 50 cents.” 10 min: Concluding remarks. Comment on new series of talks to be given covering the new book, as outlined in the insert with this &quot;Kingdom Ministry.&quot; Song 59.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">they definitely are the most beneficial ones that are published anywhere, So we have good reason to be positive and enthusiastic about offering the subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Many who accepted special issues and subscribed for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> last October are our brothers this October, fellow servants of Jehovah. And they, along with us, will be showing their concern this month—a con- , \ cern that moves them to talk about r Jehovah and to help others to come to know and serve him.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let Them Know in November</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> November is the month we have all been waiting for! A month-long campaign in which to offer to the public the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“The Nations Vfihall Know that I Am Jehovah’’ —How?</span><span class="font10"> And as an added blessing, during November we will begin studying this textbook at our congregation book studies. What a delightful double treat!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This new book is certainly a powerful, forthright denunciation of Christendom, and also a mighty shout of praise to our God Jehovah. But some may wonder. Is this the type of book the public will understand? Would it not be better to offer them something not so deep, something simpler like the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> There is no question that the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book is simple to understand, and excellent for home Bible studies. However, we should be just as realistic in our appraisal of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know” </span><span class="font10">book. No one who reads this new book can fail to realize that it exposes Christendom as being condemned by God and that it urges them to get out of Christendom quickly and to serve Jehovah, the only true God. These are things that need to be made known. Rather than being over the heads of people, it is down to earth, touching on , many points of common knowledge. L For example, what person in this • country does not know about the “Apollo” moon landings? So when the new book (pp. 157, 158) refers</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ We wish to take this opportunity to thank the more than 825 brothers who wrote the Society by September 15 volunteering to serve at Bethel for one year. One hundred brothers have now been invited to come in during the month of October. If some who were not invited to come on a temporary basis wish to apply for Bethel in the regular way for four or more years of service, they may request an application from the President’s Office or obtain one from their circuit servant. ♦ Literature offer for October: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50. (Publishers will remit to accounts servant $1.40; pioneers, 75 cents.) November: “The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”—How?</span><span class="font9"> with a booklet, for 50 cents. If supplies of the new book are not yet available, offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book for 25 cents. December: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font9"> book for $1.25. If the householder already has the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font9"> then offer the new book “The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”—How?,</span><span class="font9"> with a booklet, for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Many planning a visit to the world headquarters of Jehovah’s witnesses in ^Brooklyn inquire as to how long it akes to tour the facilities. It takes ap-&gt; proximately 1 hour and 45 minutes to tour the printing plant at 117 Adams Street, 45 minutes for the home and office at 124 Columbia Heights, and 20 </span><span class="font10">to these and explains that Apollo was the sun-god of the Greeks, the reader has no difficulty in seeing how Christendom is involved in the sun worship referred to in Ezekiel’s vision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Of course, we are free to offer whatever publication we think will best help the householder. However, the Society really believes that in view of the time in which we are living everyone should be given the opportunity to obtain this new book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As far as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Know&quot;</span><span class="font10"> book is concerned, all our territory is new, untouched. Why not, then, for at least one coverage of the territory, enthusiastically offer this book at every door. If we only hold it up and read the title, why, this alone is a powerful witness. Who knows how many times, after we leave, these words will ring in the householder’s ears, “The nations shall </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font10"> that I am Jehovah”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Others, in addition to those we meet in the house-to-house work, specially need this new book, and in many cases they will be very glad to obtain it. Who are these? Why, those we occasionally call back on, those to whom we regularly deliver the Society’s magazines, and those with whom we are now conducting Bible studies. Let’s give all of these an opportunity in November to benefit from the powerful message in this book.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Make Them Feel Welcome</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How happy all of us are to have so many interested persons attending meetings with us at the Kingdom Hall! </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study attendance averages about 110 percent when compared with the number of publishers, with even greater numbers attending the public talks. Many congregation servants in various parts of the country have informed the Society that hardly a week goes by without someone calling to ask the time of meetings or if someone would please come and study the Bible with them. How thrilling to see so many interested persons studying and attending meetings with us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We want all attending our meetings to feel welcome, for, indeed, they are welcome. What can we individually do to let them know how we feel about their being with us? First, on noting a person or persons alone, we can approach them, warmly introduce ourselves and tell them we are happy to have them with us. Even if we have other duties to care for, we can greet them and then introduce them to others so they will get acquainted and have their questions answered. Most important of all, make them feel welcome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many who have started attending our meetings have no one studying with them. A goodly number of experiences are coming to the Society such as the following one sent in by a congregation servant in Texas: “I observed a new person step into the Kingdom Hail. I approached her, introduced myself and welcomed her. I asked if she was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. She said, no, but needed to and that her husband would like to study also.” The name and address were noted and the next day the congregation servant and his wife visited the couple, got acquainted, discussed some basic truths and made arrangements to return and study the Bible systematically using the’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In addition to the joy of making these persons feel welcome, it is also our pleasure to make one another feel welcome at our meetings. How happy we are for the privilege of meeting together, to learn more of Jehovah, to encourage and incite one another to love and fine works. (Heb. 10 : 24, 25) As we take the initiative to approach ones who are just beginning to attend our meetings, and continue showing our brotherly love for one another, all will feel welcome and will be glad that they were able to attend. —John 13:34, 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Those Not Easily Contacted</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What can be done to contact personally those who are not found at home even after several calls have been made? It is good to try calling at different times during the week, evenings and on the weekend. But if they are still not at home, what can be done to make personal contact with these persons?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some publishers take the householder’s name when it is shown on the doorbell or mailbox and, having this information, look up the householder's phone number and try to make personal contact by calling at reasonable times. One can tactfully explain over the telephone that a number of attempts have been made to find them at home, but without success, and due to the importance of what the Bible tells us regarding these critical times, it seemed appropriate to contact them in this way. Good judgment and brevity are important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If a magazine was left or a study folder, this can be brought into the discussion. A brief but thoughtful presentation over the phone may produce excellent results and allow </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> specific appointment to be made for when they will Ite home. This suggestion has been used with some fine results, not only on not-at-home calls, but also where apartment dwellers’ names are obtainable, though the doorman would not allow one in to witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> How many of us have made numerous back-calls, only to find no one at home? Again, the telephone can be used to good advantage in making appointments for back-calls. A sister writes: ’One afternoon I got all my back-call records together. I made a list of the names and telephone numbers of all those I once studied with and also those I obtained subscriptions from. I called on the phone and made arrangements to call on them.’ Most individuals kept their appointment. This enabled her to accomplish much in the time she had available to spend in field service. Among other things, a number of subscriptions were obtained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If a householder does not have a telephone, or if a publisher prefers, a neatly written letter can be sent to ones who cannot be contacted personally. Some publishers whose infirmities do not permit them to share in the house-to-house ministry commendably write letters to not-at-homes listed by other publishers. Also, some publishers write such letters when circumstances temporarily confine them to their home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Another avenue effectively used to reach persons not easily contacted at home is street witnessing. Writes a pioneer congregation servant: “During the past few months I have had some wonderful experiences while engaged in magazine street work. Witnessing to people I have met on the street has resulted in placing many magazines, obtaining subscriptions and the starting of three Bible studies.’’ He also made this fine suggestion : &quot;In doing street witnessing I find it is better to stand at a corner or location that is not too busy. When you stand alone the people see you and you can approach them with a smile and cheery ‘Hello.’ They are more friendly and many will stop and talk to you.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Utilizing these suggestions to the extent possible will enable us to give a witness to many persons not easily contacted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">L»t Them Know In November </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> And here is something special to keep in mind: Why not give everyone who receives a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Know&quot; </span><span class="font10">book a special invitation to attend the congregation book study? Here is a wonderful opportunity for them to join the group study right from the beginning of its consideration of Ezekiel’s prophecy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The Society suggests that all congregations in the United States start studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Know&quot;</span><span class="font10"> book the first week in November, regardless of what publication is now being used. Seven or eight pages should be covered each week, thus completing the book in about a year. As time permits, look up and read the scriptures cited but not quoted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> What a fine program for using this new book during November! Let’s all enthusiastically share, to our blessing, to the blessing of others and to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Qiieition</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">• What should those sharing in the vacation pioneer service have in mind in requesting pioneer rates on literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The arrangement the Society has made to have a special low literature rate for pioneers is for the purpose of helping them to defray their expenses so that they can continue in the pioneer service. Vacation pioneers may also obtain literature at pioneer rates for literature they place with the public only during the dates shown on their appointment letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not proper for a vacation pioneer to obtain literature at pioneer rates for other members of the family who are not pioneering, to stock up literature to be used later on as a congregation publisher, or to obtain expensive items such as the &quot;Aid” book, deluxe Bibles, etc., for personal use or for one's theocratic library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ours is not a paid ministry nor one in which we seek advantage for ourselves, so a vacation pioneer desiring to obtain items for personal use would pay the congregation publisher price for it, having in mind that by so doing he is further sharing in the advancement of the Kingdom work.</span></p>

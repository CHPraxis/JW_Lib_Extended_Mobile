<p><span class="font10">The news from here is that Brothers Knorr, Franz and Henschel have left for Africa. They are serving the brothers at a series of assemblies there. Brother Knorr, for example, is attending assemblies in Senegal, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Kenya, as well as other lands. The Kingdom work is expanding wonderfully in Africa, and, with Jehovah’s blessing, these assemblies should be a stimulus to even greater growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other expansion is taking place right here in the United States. On January 3, four Kingdom Ministry Schools are scheduled to be in operation : One each at Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, Chicago and Norco, California. Though 11,950 students have already attended the Kingdom Ministry School, there are still about ^,000 more congregation servants, assistant congregation servants and *$ible study servants who would like &lt;o have the opportunity. The increased number of schools, each caring for twenty-five students at a time, will make it possible for more to benefit from the training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the brothers in Pittsburgh have shared in housing the servants while they were attending school, and how much they have appreciated that arrangement! “We almost feel like a part of this school,” one family said, “as we listen to the many happy and upbuilding expressions of the students.” Now, families living near the new school locations will be able to share that experience. As for the students, a brother who went through the school and who has been a high school teacher for nine years said: “The two weeks as a student were more beneficial than all the years I spent receiving a degree in worldly knowledge.” How fine it Is that Jehovah provides such training for his people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With January something else begins too—the thirty-third annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign. Are you <sub>r</sub>eady for a full share in it? Last year 1,459,786 new subscriptions</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Implanting the Word in the Hearts of Men</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> If the people to whom we present the Kingdom message are to act on what they hear, we must reach their hearts. We need to implant the soulsaving Word of God. (Jas. 1: 21) Of course, some will deliberately close their ear? and shut their eyes, failing to have a responsive heart. No amount of skill on our part will change these conditions. But even soil that might appear to be packed, rocky or weed infested can often be made productive. Can we in some way get the seed of God’s Word into the soil of the heart?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During January we again have the privilege of using one of the best instruments for reaching the heart, and that is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font10">There will be especially prepared articles during the four-month campaign to fit in with the theme that we will be discussing with householders, namely, “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.” How appropriate to make the Kingdom government the theme of our discussions! In illustrating the power of the Kingdom good news, Jesus said: “As for that [seed] on the fine soil, these are the ones that, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”—Luke 8:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do some hear the Word? Then at least they are listening. Can we help them to go farther and get the sense of it, so that the Devil by his agents does not come along and take were obtained in the United States. Just think what a fine opportunity was given to those subscribers to learn the truth. Let’s make full use of the campaign this year to extend that blessing to many more. In this way we can help them to accept the implanting of the soul-saving Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of our very warm love for all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">the seed away? Can we remove any stones that might hamper the growth of the young plant? This needs to be done right from the beginning so that tribulation or persecution will not cause them to stumble. Two demonstrations under “Your Service Meetings” will offer suggestions to help you.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Now, to be good cultivators, there are some things we need to do in advance. Practical suggestions to help you with your presentations will be found in the December </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> and in “Presenting the Good News” in this issue. If you have definite points in mind in offering subscriptions for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> this will help you to avoid just superficially sowing Kingdom seeds and will aid you to get the seeds down deep into the hearts of receptive ones so that they get the sense of the Word. Be sure to keep a good record so that you can get back to cultivate the Interest</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In fact, in many instances, studies can be started on the first call by using the Bible study folder. Be alert to your opportunities. If you do find someone who wishes to have a Bible study, will you be prepared to take care of it? Do you know in advance which evening, or other time, you can make free for it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> After teaching his disciples with many illustrations regarding the Kingdom, Jesus said: “Did you get the sense of all these things?” They said to him: “Yes.” Then he said to them: “That being the case, every public Instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.” (Matt 13:51, 52) Out of the good treasure of our heart, let us speak freely. Thus we show by our good fruits that we love Jehovah with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves.</span></p></li></ul>

Love for God and our loyalty to true worship should motivate us to respect disfellowshiping decree. If some continue association that is not absolutely necessary with disfellowshiped family member living outside the home, committee should lovingly help them to understand principles involved and to comply with Bible’s counsel. If a disfellowshiped person is not living in the home, 2 John 9-11 shows we should 'never receive him into our homes or say a greeting to him.’ Persistent disregard of the Bible’s direction to &quot;quit mixing in company” with such a person could lead to disfellowshiping, but that should not be our reason for obedience, should it?

(Part I)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman: It is reported that number of studies are being discontinued after one, two or three weeks. Two main causes: (1) Lack of real concern on part of student and (2) opposition from family and friends. First will be dealt with this week, and second next week. Preparation by publisher essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Publisher at home overheard speaking to himself regarding study started one week ago. Recalls moderate interest shown by husband and wife when studied first three paragraphs of &quot;Truth” book. What can be done to stimulate growth of interest and to help Word of God take root in heart? Brief review will help to solidify progress made on previous call and will lead into study easily. Might call attention again to picture on page 4. Also might ask if they would personally like to live where violence, crime, sickness, hunger will not exist. Such questions enable publisher to see how they are thinking. Observes that material in book often has questions directed to individual personally. (In chapter one. note questions on paragraphs 6, 7, 10(a), 11 and 12.) Will use these in such a way as to get couple to express selves from heart, remembering one is more readily convinced it helped to conclusion rather than merely telling him. Chapter ends with appropriate thoughts to stimulate desire for continued study. Publisher plans to combine that point with enthusiasm on his own part. Feels he is ready now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: Important to impart knowledge with special effort to reach heart so as to motivate interested ones. Direct attention to publisher who is just getting into study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Publisher carries through with plans made during preparation, considering paragraphs 4 through 7. Chairman interrupts, inviting audience to observe now how study is concluded with paragraphs 11 and 12 on page 10. In concluding, publisher makes appeal to take in knowledge of God’s Word, which will lead to getting “a firm hold on the real life.” Raises questions to be answered next week, to whet appetite. Couple glad to continue study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman: Emphasizes importance of endeavoring to hold student’s interest by being well prepared and using good teaching methods. Points from March 1, 1969, &quot;Watchtower,” pages 142-149, may be used. Next week will consider how to overcome second cause for studies being canceled: opposition from family and friends. Bring “Truth” book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">10 min: Question Box. School servant handles by talk or demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Also, encourage those not yet enrolled' in school to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: What Can Be Done to Keep Bible Studies Going? (Part II)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman: Last week we discussed first of two main causes for studies being discontinued: Lack of real concern on part of student. Now second main cause, opposition from family and friends, will be taken up. Discuss Matthew 13:20, 21. How can we cope with this obstacle?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Chairman discusses with publisher how this obstacle can be anticipated from first call. Fear is powerful force, but power of God's Word when deep in heart offsets effects of fear. (2 Cor. 10:4, 5) Even if no indication relatives or friends will oppose, it is good to forearm student as to what may happen. At appropriate time even on first study, you might say, “You know, some do not look with favor upon a study of the Bible, and you may find that some of your family and friends will not approve of your studying with Jehovah’s witnesses.” Later such scriptures as John 15:17-23 and 1 Peter 4:4 can be used in fortifying them for such expected opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(16 min.) Chairman invites all to observe now as publisher conducts third study with same couple. We see study in progress already, attention being directed to title of Chapter 2. On concluding paragraphs 1 and 2, after discussing broad and narrow roads, publisher asks, &quot;How do you think majority walking on broad road view those few walking on narrow road?” Couple answer, “Those walking on narrow road often ridiculed.&quot; &quot;But should that stop us from making . progress toward everlasting life?’<sup>1 </sup>Couple say they do not want to let what others do influence them; want to please God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman interrupts to explain that this will lay basis for further comments designed to help them face opposition. For instance, paragraphs 4 and 5 place emphasis on examining one’s religion as to harmony with God's Word. Assuming questions have been answered through paragraph 5, chairman invites audience to observe how applications are made. Interested couple are asked, “How can we tell when a religious organization is telling the truth?&quot; Couple answer, “By examining what they teach in the light of the Bible.&quot; “But suppose someone said to you in ridicule, ’Jehovah’s witnesses are not teaching the truth of the Bible!’ Would this stop you from examining for yourselves?” Couple answer that they would like to see for themselves what Jehovah's witnesses teach and how this lines up with Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman interrupts, saying, “We assume study goes on, but we have come to paragraph 12. Information there bears directly on opposition from friends and relatives. Observe as publisher resumes study with paragraph 12.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman concludes, summarizing important points demonstrated and emphasizing importance of preparing student in advance for opposition and educating heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem in 455 B.C.E. the walls of the city needed to be rebuilt. In just -ffty-two days they accomplished wJs remarkable feat. (Neh. 6:15) One of the major contributing factors in the work’s being done so quickly was that Governor Nehemiah did not merely stand oft at a distance and watch the reconstruction, but he “took a hand’’ in rebuilding it himself. Yes, he set the example.—Neh. 5:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Servants today who are able to share in the vacation pioneer service and who take the initiative to do so are much like Nehemiah in the effect their example has on others. The results have been outstanding. For example, one congregation in Colorado enjoyed having 60 percent of all their regular, baptized publishers in the vacation pioneer service during this past April. Another congregation, in Illinois, was thrilled to submit fifty-nine vacation pioneer ap-. plications for the same month. We wondered how it was that so many could be encouraged to join in the vacation pioneer service in one month, so we asked these and other congregations what they did, and we know that you will be interested in reading some of their replies. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font10"> <sup>3</sup> From Colorado came the answer: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font10"> “The congregation servant, commit.; ee, and most of the servant body ” are setting the lead. . . . It’s like a snowball gaining size and speed once the servants take the lead.” “It was the congregation committee that initiated applying as vacation pioneers. This was followed by the rest of the servants, then the publishers,” said the brothers in Illinois.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A congregation servant from Maryland wrote: “Six servants and their wives vacation pioneered together. . . . I’m ceaselessly thankful to Jehovah and his organization for</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">the encouragement not only to vacation pioneer, but also, as congregation servant, to take the lead.” Help is needed to carry out the work as a vacation pioneer once one starts, so we were not surprised to hear the following from a congregation in Indiana : “The congregation servant and all the other servants in the congregation signed up to vacation pioneer In April; therefore, each book study group had someone to take the lead and encourage them to join In the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> How fine it is to see that when the servants who were able “took a hand” in vacation pioneering, many others in the congregation followed their example. (Heb. 13:7) Many have found that, with good planning, they are able to vacation pioneer in March and April. Now is the time to begin making preparations. If not for one or two months, perhaps you can be a vacation pioneer for two weeks. We will be pleased to have your application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How fine it has been to study in detail the book of Revelation with the assistance of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot; </span><span class="font10">book!

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In speaking the good news to people our objective is to reach their hearts. Because of the natural resistance toward callers at the door, some may reply, “I’m not interested,” or, “I’m busy.” This may be, not their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hearts</span><span class="font10"> speaking, but merely an automatic response. For this reason it is important to say something right at the beginning of your discussion that will get the person to think, to touch his heart, if possible, so as to get a response from the heart. The following approaches might be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Since a subject of great concern is the pollution situation, we might say: “Pollution today is affecting everybody. Because of the concern we have for ourselves and our families, we can no longer ignore this problem, thinking that things will get better. Scientists tell us that pollution, if not stopped, will wipe out the human race in this generation. So we don’t have to wait for a global war to kill us all off, do we? [Allow for response.] In the cities, children cannot run and play without fear of damaging their lungs and hearts. The air, the water, our whole environment is getting to be filled with contamination, bringing sickness and death. Do you think God will do anything about this? [Allow for response.] How comforting it is to read in the Bible that God will bring to ruin those who are ruining the earth. The time is near at hand</span></p></li></ul>

It takes a little more effort to chew and digest this faith-building food for the mind and heart, but how strengthening it is when we assimilate the good things that Jehovah knows we need.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Circuit servants have been helping the book study servants to be better teachers at the book studies by having a special meeting with them during their visits. The book study servants have appreciated this training to help them make the studies even more interesting, instructive and lively. when, by his Kingdom government, he will solve this problem of pollution as well as other problems that man has been battling for centuries.” (Proceed to Rev. 21: 3, 4; Dan. 2: 44 or Ps. 37:10,11.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Other hearts might be awakened by calling attention to the danger that householders personally face because of increased crime. If something has occurred locally so that there is fear on the street or fear for security in the home, mention this first. Get the householder’s comment on the situation. Then you might continue: “Is the answer the increasing of the number of policemen? Even if we have one on every street corner, we have to face the fact that often police officers cannot protect themselves when violence breaks out, much less one of us. Some persons have been so frightened that they have been taking lessons in using a gun. But it is a mistake to become violently inclined. Jesus said that when these things happen, lift up your heads, for your deliverance is near. The Bible tells us what God will do about this and how we can be good people in his eyes, rather than to become involved in destructiveness and death.” (Turn to scripture or thought expressed in magazine.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If we can get the other person’s heart aroused by causing him to realize the hopelessness of the situation from man's viewpoint, and by creating a spark of desire to see what God’s Word has to say, we have accomplished much.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">• How should the school servant counsel those having reading assign ments when the next points f</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font9">consideration on the Speech Counsel slip do not specifically apply to reading?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whenever a student has a reading assignment from the Bible, it is suggested that the school servant select the next point or two that apply particularly in a reading assignment, skipping over those points that do not apply. The student should consult with the school servant well in advance as to what he should work on, so that both know the point(s) on which counsel will be given. If the school servant wants to notify the student of these points of counsel at the time that he gives him the assignment for the talk, he may do that. The student can then have these in mind in preparing his talk and can check “Qualified to Be Ministers” under Progressive Speech Training for suggestions as to improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While there are a few points dealing with the composition of a talk that do not apply to a reading assignment, most of the points having to do with delivery will apply to a reading assignment. Since there will be a brief introduction and conclusion, counsel can be given on these when called for on the counsel slip. The points skipped over can be considered at a later time when the student receives an assignment for one of the other talks. This will still maintain a program in which, to a reasonable extent, the points on the counsel slip will be covered in the order In which they are listed.</span></p>

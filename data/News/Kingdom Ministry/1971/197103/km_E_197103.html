<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^DeaA ^Kingdom ^PubCislie/tS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">One of our blessings while serving at Bethel is to hear encouraging news during our mealtimes. Brother Henschel recently returned from serving the brothers in Madagascar, Reunion, Mauritius, Ethiopia and Lebanon, as well as being at the assemblies in Africa. He told us that the brothers in Madagascar continue to meet and study the truth, but they must limit their gatherings to small groups in their homes. Their spirits are good in spite of the problems now existing. In Reunion and Mauritius the brothers are able to assemble in Kingdom Halls, and the work goes ahead freely there. More than 900 were able to meet in various homes in Ethiopia during his visit, and the good news continues to be preached ‘in that land. In Lebanon there are .? many problems common to the Middle East, but the brothers were able to reach a new peak of 1,312 publishers in December. It was possible for some brothers from Syria and Jordan to attend meetings in Lebanon. The brothers in Syria were just released from prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other interesting news reported to us at Bethel came from Spain. The branch servant reported holding their first circuit assembly authorized by the Spanish government. The entire program was handled by the Spanish brothers. The peak attendance was 1,079 at Barcelona. There were 17 immersed. News reporters heard that permission was granted for the assembly so they came and gave very good reports in the national press. The government news agency broadcast the news by radio throughout Spain. Our Spanish brothers are rejoicing and look forward to holding more circuit assemblies in Spain soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here in the United States our work is also producing fruitage. From September through January, U)1~jiew congregations were formed ;^scompared with 63 during the &lt;f»i esponding period in the previous year. What a pleasure it is to see</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A fine new peak in publishers! Just think of it: During January, though the weather was bitter cold in many places, we pushed up over the 400,000 mark in publishers for the first time. This surpassed December’s peak by 4,230. How fine It is to see that so many new ones are having a part in Jehovah’s service, imitating the example set by Jesus!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> And good results were had by those sharing in the work. You will be pleased to know that, during January, 202,470 new subscriptions were' obtained—11,228 more than last January. And 7,065,949 magazines were placed—768,800 more than a year ago. There was good follow-up activity too. More are sharing in the Bible study work, and more who obtain the literature are showing a willingness to study. Bible studies went up from 298,599 in December to 309,996 in January. This is cause for rejoicing!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> There is such a variety of talent in Jehovah’s organization today, and we can all use our talents to advance true worship. Some of us do excellently in placing magazines, others are adept at starting studies, still others love to work business territory, and all of us want to be successful in getting subscriptions for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">Each one of us can share what he has, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Have you thought that you would like to spend one Sunday during March putting forth a greater effort than before to make return visits on those persons who promised to take subscriptions? This extra effort may be just what is Jehovah giving his blessing upon the work!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">We are glad to share such good news with you as we all run the race that is set before us.</span></p>

Or, perhaps, during March you could make a list of all the persons you know that you would like to see at the Kingdom TTall for the special public talk on March 28 and also for the Memorial on April 9. As you make calls on these persons to invite them to these special meetings you can further acquaint them with the truth, perhaps Inviting them to subscribe for the magazines. How wonderful it would be to have outstanding attendances at both the special talk and the Memorial this year! Inviting others to these meetings is something in which all of us can share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Have you cultivated the ability to do incidental witnessing? It is quite profitable to carry one of the small books with you in your purse or coat pocket so you have something to offer at every opportunity. Copies of the magazines likewise lend themselves nicely to this use, and you may be successful in getting a number of subscriptions in this manner. Witnessing at every opportunity has much to recommend IL For example, in Brazil a brother went to a barbershop operated by another Witness and,- on entering, greeted the barber as “Brother.” A lady present exclaimed that it was strange that two brothers should look so unalike. This gave opportunity for a witness that resulted in placing the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> book and making arrangements for a study. The woman is already attending meetings and witnessing. In East Germany, while a brother was in a city to do some business, a young blind man approached him, asking him to lead him to the other side of the street. The brother felt pity for this young man and started to tell him about the wonderful time when all the ailments of mankind that physicians</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">8 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Question Box. Highlight role played by publisher preparing student for the ministry, possibly demonstrating appropriate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">22 min: Would You Like to Start More Bible Studies? Demonstration and audience discussion of direct approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Chairman: Would you like to start a Bible study during this “Watchtower” campaign? Experience has proved that it is quite effective to offer subscriptions whenever Bible study offer refused. In three-month period a circuit servant and his wife started ninety Bible studies using the following presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(17 min.) Capable publisher gives presentation to audience, using own words. Chairman interrupts at appropriate places to discuss briefly the whys and wherefores so all will clearly understand why this approach is so successful in getting and holding the attention of householders from the introduction all the way through to the conclusion. Highlight advantages. (Afterward have capable publisher demonstrate presentation with householder so brothers can see it from beginning to end.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Hello. I am calling on those who have a common concern for the future. Things are happening so fast in the world that a person hardly knows what to think isn’t that true? [Pause for householder's answer after this and each of the following questions. Chairman can answer for audience.] Many changes are taking place, isn't that right? You would like to see better conditions, wouldn’t you? Do you think they will ever come? If a wish could come true, what would you like to see take place more than anything else? [Usually householders say they would like to see peace or good health.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“An artist drew a picture of what he believed the earth would be like some day. [While saying this take out “Truth” book and draw attention to picture on page 4.] Notice the title of the first chapter, ‘Grand Blessings from God Near at Hand!’ Does this sound a little presumptuous or possibly unrealistic, especially when we see conditions in the world worsening?” (Read first paragraph right through, up to question, “What does it all mean?” Then, without mentioning study, ask question on first paragraph, giving the householder your copy ofi the book with the answers neatly' underlined so he can answer easily.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continue through paragraphs two and three, reading them or having them read. (Some are poor readers and it is best not to embarrass them by insisting they read.) Read scriptures and ask questions to help householder to get the sense of them and to see how they apply. Then ask: “Do you have time for just one more paragraph?” With permission you may consider paragraph four. (If you detect at the start that householder is very busy you may want to handle paragraph three only, as this has been found most practical in such cases.) In conclusion ask: “Well, how did you like it?” Very briefly review what has been learned and ask: “Are you usually home at this time? I would like to call next week at [state day and time] and cover a few more paragraphs with you, possibly even completing the chapter ^Grand Blessings from God Near at Hand!’ ” If the Bible study is refused, you still have a fine basis for making the current offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 mln.) Chairman: Emphasize following point: When making presentation in field, be sure to allow householder time to answer questions asked throughout presentation so as to draw him into discussion. Encourage brothers to practice this presentation with one another. The one acting as householder can realistically simulate situations and objections that come up in the territory. When practicing, try to make each “householder” different. Remind brothers that preparation is the key to a more enjoyable and successful ministry. If some have problems in keeping studies going, encourage them to review points in January “Kingdom Ministry,” page 2, column 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Inviting Those in School to Our Meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Chairman briefly comments on the many opportunities open to youths in school to give a witness. They have a wonderful territory that others find difficult to reach. A fine way to give a witness is to invite interested schoolmates to our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Demonstration. In school cafeteria young sister remarks to two young brothers that a classmate’s mother is studying the Bible with the Witnesses. A brother asks If sister has witnessed to girl. *A little,’ she replies, 'but does not seem very interested.* Brother suggests inviting her to meeting. Refers to experience. (yb69, p. 134, par. 1) Second brother stresses need to invite all who show some interest, schoolmates or teachers. (yb63, p. 220. par. 1) Sister says she will invite classmate as soon as she sees her</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Chairman encourages youths to follow this good example. Discuss local experiences. Our young brothers in Africa and India are thinking of their schoolmates. (yb71, p. 113, par. 1; yb64, p. 177, pars. 1, 2) inviting those in school to meetings will do much good and you will enjoy many blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Congregation servant encourages all to work hard for outstanding attendance at Memorial. Cites benefits and blessings. Song 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">13 min: Presenting the Good News. Discussion and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “Do You Remember?&quot; Lively and informative discussion of points from January 1, 1971, &quot;Watchtower,&quot; pages 30 and 31.</span></p>

By taking advantage of opportunities for incidental witnessing we share with others the good news that we all have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Indeed, as we reflect on Paul’s words at Romans 12:4-8, we are thrilled with all the various talents and gifts that we are able to blend together in the Christian congregation. During the month of March, if we do what we can and share what we have, we will be enabled to run the race with endurance and to impart a blessing to those who listen to us.—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>’ What Will This Mem</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Last year in the United States we had a marvelous blessing from Jehovah, with 836,058 present for fljie Memorial, 548,240 at the special talk and 374,878 publishers reporting during that month. Other countries had excellent attendances also. What will the Memorial season bring this year?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> When we put forth a special effort to invite people to our meetings and to get new ones started in the ministry, we are doing what Jehovah delights in. Surely we can rejoice in such activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Take, for example, the public talk scheduled for Sunday, March 28. The subject of this special talk, “Restoration of All Things of Which God Spoke,” is indeed something delightful to contemplate and surely we will want to give special publicity to this discourse. Everyone should be invited to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> We should never underestimate the value of meetings and the impact they have on interested ones. In fact, attending just one meeting is sufficient to change a person’s entire outlook. On the isle of Madeira an Interested man studied in spite of constant opposition from his wife. When invited to his first meeting he was determined to go and said that his wife would have to stay home alone if she did not want to accompany him. Living in an isolated area and being rather nervous, she was afraid to stay home alone, so she decided to accompany her husband. She could not resist the appealing message of truth, and this first meeting aroused her desire to study the Bible. After several months of study both husband and wife were baptized on the same day. Surely there are compelling reasons for inviting as many as possible to the special talk this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> And what about the distribution of magazines during March? From Liberia comes an experience showing what one copy of a magazine can do. Indeed, it can produce dramatic changes in a person’s life. A man living in unassigned territory received a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> and he was so impressed with the presentation “Finding an Answer to the Problem of Race” that he set out at once in search of a woman living in Monrovia, the capital, whom he knew to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Finding that she had died, he continued his search for the Kingdom Hall and finally found one. A study was arranged with him, and after a few weeks he came to engage in the field service, but it was then discovered that he had four wives!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Season Bring?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Literature offer: March and April: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscription, with three booklets, for $1. May: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font7"> book on 25c contribution. June: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of</span><span class="font7"> God? for a contribution of $1.25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Society recommends that accounts servants type or write on slips of paper the names of all subscribers shown on the subscription record sheets since January 1970. Then these slips can be given to the book study servants for distribution to the publishers. If all of these calls are made and these persons are invited to the special talk and Memorial, surely it will add much to the witness being given at this season of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Bethel home and factory will be closed on Saturday, April 17, 1971, for spring cleaning. It will not be possible to take tours or to pick up or to place literature and magazine orders on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Regular pioneers serving since February 1, 1971, will be sent a cafeteria ticket with the March 15 pioneer letter,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font8">Unhesitatingly he started arrangements to send away three of his wives. With determination he put on the new personality, resigned his commission with the militia, legalized his marriage to his one remaining wife, and now that wife has joined her husband in the ministry. All this started with just one issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> Will you have a full share in distributing the magazines during March?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Will you be able perhaps to vacation pioneer during March or April? Be sure to read the heartwarming experience of one of our young brothers from the Solomon Islands paralyzed from the hips down from polio during his youth. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(1971 Yearbook,</span><span class="font8"> p. 241) After he learned the truth he was determined to serve Jehovah as a full-time pioneer, if possible. You will find this experience moving and faithstrengthening. Truly Jehovah sustains those who cast their burdens on him in full faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Since the Memorial is the most important meeting of the entire year, certainly we want to Invite everyone to attend. Surely we would all like to see a peak attendance at our Kingdom Halls on April 9. In one congregation in Ghana last year the brothers went all out to advertise the Memorial. This congregation of about 100 publishers was delighted to see 9G6 persons at the Memorial that evening!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>s</sup> If each one of us—servant, pioneer and publisher alike—makes this a matter of prayer and works diligently toward generating a spirit of enthusiasm and excitement for the Memorial season this year, surely untold blessings will flow to us and to those whom we encourage to associate with us.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Field for You?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Would you like to work In territory that may not have been covered in years? Would you have an increased desire to work it if you knew that quite likely it was several times more productive than the area you are now working, and the people you would meet would generally be far more responsive and friendly? Suppose you knew that the presentations that would be used in this territory could be very brief and easy to deliver? Would that appeal to you also? In all probability you have such a field for cultivation within your own congregation’s assignment. What is it? The business and shopping areas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Is this field really productive? One circuit servant who regularly works business areas wrote: “The comment of one brother after working business territory for the first time well sums up the reaction of many that have come with us. He stated: ‘I have found it to be like working unassigned territory.’ ” Another stated: “I was able to get well over 100 subscriptions during the last </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> campaign by working only one morning a week for about two hours.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> What is your initial reaction to working business territory? It may' well be similar to that of a publisher who said : “My initial feeling was uneasy, nervous; I felt inadequate to talk to business people. Then I realized, after talking to merchants, that I was missing out on blessings in this field.” Generally, business people are very friendly when you call, since you may be a potential customer. Also, they are well informed about world conditions, community problems, etc,, as their businesses are directly affected by these things, and, being knowledgeable, they are often very Interesting to talk to.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> It is best to call at times when the stores and offices are not so crowded, such as midweek or the earlier hours of the morning on Saturday. A brief, simple approach is often best when contacting business people since a customer may enter the place of business and interrupt your conversation at any time. As you approach the business place determine whether it is a good time to go inside. If there are too many customers, then make a note to call back in a few minutes or later that morning. Once inside, you</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Starting the first weekend in May, circuit servants will be giving the public talk &quot;Proclaiming Good News In All the Earth.” which Includes the use of eighty colored slides.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">After Preparing with Practice Sessions</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A great aid in these days to motivating the entire family to right works are home practice sessions. One circuit servant reports that he has been recommending to families discussion and practice sessions having to do with the field ministry, and with good results. One week, for ten or fifteen minutes following the family study, the family head could lead the family in discussing and practicing magazine presentations. Next week, they could discuss how to keep a neat house-to-house record. Next, what to have in one’s witnessing ease. (Many of the younger publishers do not have one, but he has noticed that it helps some to have more of a personal interest In the work when they have a case of their own.) Next, how to dress presentably for the service. (In some instances the children are not dressed in a way that befits the Christian ministry. Sometimes the attire and grooming of teen-age publishers leave something to be desired.) Then, demonstrate and help one another to become effective in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Field for You? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">may ask for the manager. Having contacted the one in charge, it is good to have the following thoughts in mind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> In working the territory one time you might initially offer a handbill (the next time you might use the Bible-study folder), mentioning that you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses. If you receive an unfavorable reaction it may be best to terminate the visit at that point. If the handbill is accepted reluctantly but you do not observe any opposition or annoyance, then you may choose to offer only the magazines. In the majority of instances, however, the acceptance of the handbill will be warm, with no annoyance, and the current offer can be made briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Your presentation might be something like this: “We’re making visits today on the business and professional people in the community to alert them to . . . [offer handbill]. The reason we’ve come to your dealing with various objections, making back-calls, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> The Society recommends that when practice sessions are held they should simulate actual conditions that exist in the field. In this way greater discernment Is gained, since we learn how to deal with common objections that actually do come up in the field. For example, in one practice session the following points were developed in connection with the objection: “I have my own church. I am not interested.” &quot;Oh, I see,” the publisher replied. “Which church is it that you attend?&quot; “How many attend at your church?” “Have they said much lately at your church about what this world is coming to?” Usually their response to such questions is vague. But asking questions about their church often makes them forget their objection and shows that we are interested in their opinions, and these, of course, enable us to see how best to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> During home practice sessions we develop our ability to present the good news more effectively in the field. If you are not doing this yet as a family, why not plan on doing so shortly?</span></p>

However, we do have a very important message, one that affects you personally, or we wouldn’t attempt to contact you like-this. In view of this, we would like to ask you at least to look into our message. So that you may do this, we are offering ... on a contribution of only »»</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Before sharing in this work you may want to practice the foregoing or a similar presentation with someone who acts the part of the various types of businessmen and who portrays the situations you will meet in the field. Such practice sessions will build confidence and increase effectiveness. When persons show interest it may be possible to get their home address and an appointment for a return visit. If the businessman lives in the territory of another congregation, the name and address can be forwarded to the appropriate congregation servant.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font7">• What procedure should be followed in determining if one should be counted as a new publisher?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To determine whether one is qualified to share in the ministry as an associate of Jehovah’s witnesses, ten basic questions are presented on page 108 of the &quot;Lamp” book as a guide. Before inviting anyone to go along with you in the field service, it would be wise to discuss these righteous requirements together. This can be done when these subjects come up in the Bible study or at other appropriate times. This is not done to pry into one’s personal life, but to have reasonable assurance that one qualifies and will not be misrepresenting Jehovah's name or His people when serving in the public ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon receiving a field service report for a new publisher, the assistant congregation servant will present it to the congregation servant, who then has a personal talk with the individual. (See page 129, par. 2, of the &quot;Lamp” book.) This provides occasion to commend him warmly for the progress made and to encourage him to utilize fully the provisions Jehovah has made. Some of these are personal study, meeting attendance and training for the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Circumstances vary, but on this occasion the overseer can discuss, to the extent thought necessary, the righteous requirements one must meet before being counted *as a publisher. The objective is to help the new one understand that God has certain requirements for anyone representing him as a bearer of the good news, without implying that he is doing something wrong. If properly handled, what might be considered a delicate situation will result in little or no embarrassment. This will do much to ensure that Jehovah's Christian congregation will grow in both quality and quantity to His praise.</span></p>

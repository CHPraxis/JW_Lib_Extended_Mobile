<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">At our Bethel breakfast table the other morning Brother Franz delighted us with a very special report. He had just returned from a three-week trip through some of the central countries of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">His first stop was at Dakar, Senegal, where there was a peak attendance of 325, and although there are only 178 publishers in the country, 25 were baptized. The Ivory Coast has 453 publishers, yet for the public talk there were 1,003 present. Seventy-eight were baptized here. In Togo it seemed providential that the “Esther” drama was scheduled for the opening day of that assembly, for immediately afterward the health officials moved in and closed the assembly down, using the danger of cholera as a pretext for their action. With only 1,638 publishers in the country, it was gratifying that 4,089 were present for the drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was thrilling to hear Brother Franz tell of the growth in these countries. But for sheer numbers nothing compared with the figures he gave on the Nigerian assembly in Lagos. Whereas there are about 85,000 publishers in that country, at the public talk 121,128 heard Brother Knorr ! And 3,778 were baptized ! There in Lagos the English talks were translated simultaneously into 16 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special feature of the Nigerian assembly was the arrival by chartered jet plane of 112 of our brothers from London, England. And nearly 240 brothers from the North American continent were present, making it truly an international assembly! The American brothers were also privileged to attend some of the other assemblies in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Franz said the work is growing so fast in Nigeria the brothers there no longer speak of an expansion, but an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">explosion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The family here is now looking forward to hearing further reports of the work in Africa when Brothers Knorr and Henschel return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Thrilling Times</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Thrilling, absolutely thrilling!” Is this not a comment frequently heard about the grand increases in Jehovah’s work? The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1971 Yearbook </span><span class="font11">report is thrilling, as are Theocratic News items in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font11">concerning additional increases. As Jehovah’s Christian witnesses we keenly feel the spirit of urgency that is surging throughout the ranks of his people in this most momentous, thrilling time of man’s history.—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In most congregation territories more and more people express concern over the critical and terrifying problems plaguing this generation and man’s failure to solve them. As a result, thousands of persons who would not take time to listen to us in the past, nor to read the Bible literature we offered, are now both listening and reading, and large numbers of them are also attending our meetings. It is thrilling, isn’t it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During February all of us want to continue to have a share in the thrilling work of helping others to learn of Jehovah and his provisions for salvation, in the Kingdom way. Just as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font11"> has spiritually enlightened and strengthened us, we know its information will help others, and hence we are delighted to utilize every opportunity to offer a subscription for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> with three booklets, for $1, or subscriptions for both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> with six booklets, for $2. Often double subscriptions are as readily obtained as single subscriptions. Writes a brother : “Recently I tried offering the two subscriptions. I reasoned that I could do it just about as briefly as one.” What resulted? That morning he obtained two double subscriptions, a total of four subscriptions for the morning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A vacation pioneer sister working in Michigan was thrilled to obtain nine subscriptions in one month from not-at-homes. What did she do? She left a Bible study folder where no one was at home in the morning and called back in the afternoon or evening. A good idea!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If you cannot be out in regular field service because of inclement weather, sickness, etc., or possibly have only a few minutes on occasion for witnessing, you might like to try the following suggestion: A sister selected names of householders from the phone directory, called and gave a brief witness, and then made the subscription offer. She was thrilled with the results. Eight subscriptions in one day! The next day she obtained two more subscriptions, as well as listing several prospects, by doing the same thing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> “I had never before been contacted by one of Jehovah’s witnesses and had never seen a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine,” was part of the experience related by a newly baptized brother at a circuit assembly in New Jersey. How was he initially contacted? “A sister entered my place of business, . . . offered me the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines.” He accepted the magazines; at the sister’s request a brother made a back-call, a study was started and six months later the businessman was baptized. Now he is thrilled to share the truth with others. In fact, he writes, “I am now selling my home and plan to move . . . ” to where the need is greater. Yes, this helps us to appreciate the importance of store-to-store work and of following up all placements to start Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> When sending in subscriptions for the congregation, an overseer in Michigan was thrilled to write: “A brother decided to make calls upon all persons who had promised to obtain the subscription or who had shown any interest. To his good pleasure he was able to obtain twelve new subscriptions.” Are you keeping record of all “subscription promises” and calling back?</span></p></li>

(“Lamp,” p. 72, par. 1; p. 189, par. 2) How urgent is it to spend as much time as possible in preaching? (Matt. 24:14; “Lamp,” p. 210, par. 1) While we should never neglect Scriptural obligations, why must preaching take priority over personal interests? (Matt. 6:33; 1 Cor. 7:29-31; “Lamp,” p. 187, par. 1 to p. 189, par. 1) What part does pioneer service have in getting the preaching work done before the “great tribulation,” and how is it possible for many to share in it now? (“Lamp,” pp. 194, 195) Many are infirm, have health problems, family or other obligations. Still others are not yet able to attain the regular pioneer goals. How should these view such circumstances?

If unable to become a regular pioneer, what other privilege is available? (“Lamp,” p. 199; w67, p. 83, par. 12) If unable to vacation or regular pioneer now, should this prevent one from joyfully preaching and worshiping God whole-souled? (w68, p. 525, pars. 17, 18; w70, p. 434, par. 8; “Lamp,” p. 207, par. 3, first two sentences) What principles are enunciated in the following scriptures as to our service and worship of God regardless of our “status” in the organization?

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dear Brothers and Sisters Everywhere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the ever-increasing size of our loving theocratic family it is impossible for all of us pioneers individually to meet the hundreds of thousands of you other publishers throughout the United States. But by means of this letter we hope that you will at least get to know us a little better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the outset we want you to know how much we appreciate what you congregation publishers have been doing over the years —in the house-to-house work, making back-calls, conducting Bible studies and bringing many, many new ones on to maturity, hi fact, you congregation publishers, all together, total up many more hours of service in the ministry than we pioneers do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You certainly are also to be commended for the individual efforts some of you are putting forth. Many of you have families and we know that with your little ones, and the struggle you are having to provide for them, it sometimes takes a much greater effort on your part to get in a few hours of service during a month than for those of us pioneers who are strong and unencumbered to reach our pioneer goals. But remember, if you are wholehearted in your service, Jehovah, who was pleased with the widow’s ‘two small coins of little value,’ is also well pleased with your offering of praise, as little as it might sometimes seem in the eyes of men.—Mark 12:41-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At one time we also were congregation publishers, but we were able to arrange our affairs to spend more time giving praise to Jehovah’s name, advertising his King and Kingdom and making people happy with a knowledge of the truth. This very full life in Jehovah’s service has in turn brought us a greater measure of joy and contentment. Perhaps some of you also can arrange to share in the full-time preaching.</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_197102_files/km_E_197102-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:136pt;height:182pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Many of us have been pioneering for a long, long time now, some for nearly half a century. But if you look at the accompanying chart (No. 1) you will see that by far the majority of us have been pioneering less than ten years. So our motive for inviting you to join our ranks is not simply to recruit replacements for some of us old-timers. Rather, we are primarily motivated by the urgency of the times and the tremendous amount of work yet to be accomplished in the final part of this “time of the end.” It is not as if we were just getting started with the ingathering of the “great crowd . . . out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” No, but rather it is because we are nearing the final windup of this grand work.—Rev. 7:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Entering the pioneer work involves a big decision. We know this; it did for us too. So, before making your decision you ought to have a good idea of what is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font0"> book (pp. 194-200), of course, outlines the basic requirements that must be met by regular and vacation pioneers. But for the benefit of some of you new ones who have only recently started associating with us, let’s review briefly some of these points. First of all, before you can enroll as a regular pioneer you must have been baptized for at least six months, and during the past six months you must have been a regular publisher reporting at least ten hours and six back-calls on the average each month. You must currently be conducting at least one home Bible study. It is obvious, too, that your conduct must recommend you as a fine Christian in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Once you are enrolled as a regular pioneer you will be expected to average 100 hours each month (a total of 1,200 hours a year) in the ministry. This is not a great deal of time, for when you break it down it amounts to an average of something like three hours and twenty minutes a day. This makes it possible for you to work at some part-time secular activity, if you find it necessary, to support yourself in the work, as the apostle Paul and others in the first century did.—Acts 18:2-4; 20:33, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If circumstances prevent you from being a regular pioneer, a special arrangement is made so that you can “vacation” pioneer for one, two or more months. If you can vacation pioneer for only a couple of consecutive weeks, then the requirement is seventy-five hours during that month. Vacation pioneering is a special privilege too for the newly baptized Witness, for such one does not have to wait for six months; he can go vacation pioneering the next day after baptism if he has regularly published for six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Can You Vacation Pioneer?</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_197102_files/km_E_197102-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:134pt;height:181pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">This special arrangement made by the Society whereby you congregation publishers can pioneer foi' a limited period is certainly a loving provision. It allows teen-agers who have not completed school, as well as fathers and mothers with families, and who are unable to pioneer on a full-time basis, to have a taste of some of the joys we pioneers feast on all the time. It is also an excellent way for those of you who for health, financial or other reasons find it impossible to make a go of it all year round. And for you newly baptized publishers who are not eligible to be regular pioneers, why, here’s your opportunity to begin now doing what you like best!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We might also liken vacation pioneering to a training course in flying for fledglings who need confidence in their wings and in themselves. The feeling of satisfaction that comes with successful accomplishment makes ever so many keep coming back again and again for short-term vacation pioneering, until the time when they are able to make it the regular thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And do you know, vacation pioneering was the initial step that led many of us to become regular or special pioneers, circuit or district servants, missionaries or members of the Bethel family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You remember what Ecclesiastes 3:1 says: “For everything there is an appointed time, even a time for every affair under the heavens.” This is true in all our lives, whether we are congregation publishers or pioneers, is it not? During the year we all set aside a certain amount of time for essential matters in life—eating, sleeping, etc. We also enjoy a certain amount of relaxation and vacation. But our greatest joys come from devoting time to the worship and service of our God Jehovah, is it not so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the normal worship required by the Law, the Israelites could voluntarily make “a special vow to live as a Nazirite to Jehovah.” During that time they would abstain from some of the normal activities of life, in order to be especially “separated to Jehovah.” (Num. 6:2-8) Now today it is impossible for you to take a Nazirite vow, but as congregation publishers you can do something similar when you vacation pioneer. That’s why it’s considered as one of the “special privileges of service” in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font0"> book, pages 186 and 199.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This special privilege of service is open all year round to all who qualify. Many sign up so they can devote more time to Jehovah during the visit of the circuit servant. Others set aside the month of March or April for pioneering. Still others take advantage of the summer or winter vacation periods when they have time off from school or secular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Particularly during the last two years there has been a great increase in the number of those who have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at least once a year </span><span class="font0">been “separated to Jehovah” as vacation pioneers. This as graphically shown in chart No. 2. The figure of 78,857 represents the number of vacation pioneer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">appointments. </span><span class="font0">Please note too the ever-increasing number of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">extensions</span><span class="font0"> of vacation pioneer appointments. Some publishers have served as vacation pioneers for a number of consecutive months, or more than once during the year. Thus a total of 104,008 vacation pioneer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reports</span><span class="font0"> were received from the 78,857 during the 1970 service year as mentioned on page 73 of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1971 Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is written: “There is nothing better than that the man should rejoice in his works.” (Eccl. 3:22) As pioneers we know of no better way to reap this joy from one’s own works than to be in Jehovah’s service full time. As a congregation publisher you can experience it by setting aside time to vacation pioneer, such as during March and/or April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why not make it a matter of conversation in your family and in your congregation, encouraging others to join you or to cooperate with you to make it possible? More important, why not make it a matter of prayer to your all-powerful heavenly Father?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will find increased satisfaction in your own individual “works” as a vacation pioneer, serving Jehovah in this special way. And who knows, your vacation pioneering this March or April may provide just the needed stimulus in your* devotion to Jehovah to put you eventually in the expanding ranks of the regular pioneers. That too would be something extra-special over which to rejoice. Just think of the millions upon millions more hours devoted to Jehovah’s praise, if the figures on these charts were doubled!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Pioneers Themselves Say</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Would you like to hear actual experiences telling what encouraged some of us to become regular pioneers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Love of Jehovah was certainly motive enough for this Connecticut sister: “I love Jehovah and want to serve him to the very best of my ability. And what better way is there to do this than to go from door to door telling people of the wonderful hope which Jehovah offers this sick world? I am young, single, in good health and dedicated. Really, I have no excuse for not being a pioneer.” A Nebraska pioneer says: “The full-time ministry even deepens one’s appreciation of Jehovah’s love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pioneering versus going to college—which is the better course? “Before leaving high school,” this young man in California says, “one of my problems was whether to go to college or not. I remember the day quite well; my father sat down and gave me a long talk. He pointed out the shortness of time, and the critical days we are living in. About the time I would get out of college this system of things may be ended. I would have accomplished nothing; probably even lose my life. So I decided to pioneer.” Perhaps some of you fathers should have a heart-to-heart talk with your teen-agers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you really believe that time for this generation is running out? This sister in California says: “Three other sisters and I were talking about pioneering, and we concluded that if we really believed that this is Jehovah’s organization and that Armageddon is really coming, then we’d better be doing all that we can to help those who are desiring to gain eternal life. As a result the four of us applied for the regular pioneer service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did you ever consider pioneering as a lifetime career? Looking back, this Texas pioneer was happy that he did. “Thirty years ago my entire family (wife and two children) and I gladly disposed of our home and other possessions and went pioneering. In doing so it was with the full intention of remaining such for the rest of my life. I will soon be seventy-eight years of age. My wife and I want to say that it’s been a great privilege over the years to help many to become witnesses of Jehovah!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the many things pioneering teaches us is to develop a practical schedule. For example, a sister in Illinois says: “After my vacation pioneering time was up, the schedule I had made was so workable I continued to put in vacation pioneer hours without any trouble at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Scheduling her time helped this Texas pioneer to overcome obstacles in her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As she tells it: “My main worries that held me back from pioneering for a long time concerned my health, my unbelieving husband and my household duties. But now that I am pioneering my health has improved, I get about as much done around the house and my husband is happy to help out too. My joys are also much greater now that I’m pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here’s how good scheduling allowed this Kentucky family to pioneer: “After we all enjoyed vacation pioneering in April, our family then sat down and made a schedule so that my mother and I could be regular pioneers and my three sisters could vacation pioneer during school vacation. My father plans to work only part time after my sisters finish school so that he too can be a regular pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As pioneers, we all run into problems; they can’t be avoided. But this Oklahoma pioneer has some good advice in this regard. “During my years of pioneering I have experienced times of discouragement. But I have learned that no problem can be solved by running away from it. A good schedule and firm determination, along with Jehovah’s help, have solved the problems I have had.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, perhaps some problems of congregation publishers can be solved by entering the pioneer service. This Maryland pioneer thinks so. “After twenty-five years as a congregation publisher I decided last October to vacation pioneer. I enjoyed it so much I signed up again in November and then continued all winter. I had always believed the winters were too severe for me to ever be a regular pioneer. But I survived better than during other winters; I had less flu and cold, and enjoyed the snow as when I was a child.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consider how this sister in California solved her dilemma—too many back-calls, on the one hand, and a two-year-old, on the other. “After vacation pioneering I found I couldn’t possibly take care of my back-calls just getting out a few times during the week. Regular pioneering was the only answer. But then I had a two-year-old son. However, with the help of Jehovah, my family and other sisters, I have been able to pioneer regularly. Never have I been happier or had such peace of mind. Thanks to Jehovah for this privilege!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speaking of sheer joy in the full-time service, a pioneer in Kentucky declares: “I used to listen to pioneers speak of their joy. I thought they were exaggerating. Now as a pioneer myself I can say, like the Queen of Sheba, ‘They didn’t tell me the half of it!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you high-school publishers know that in some parts of the country you can go to school and still pioneer? This Florida pioneer tells how: “Last fall when I went back to school I learned that they had a new program called DCT (Diversified Cooperative Training). In this arrangement a student goes to school a half day and works at a secular job the other half, for which three credits are given toward graduation. When I explained that I was a minister of Jehovah and I would like to pioneer that half day the permission was granted. So I would highly recommend that other students also take advantage of the DCT program.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Decisions! Decisions! So often decisions are never made, because they are continually pushed into the future. This Oklahoma pioneer expresses how many of us came to grips with the problem of whether to pioneer or not. He says: “After so long a time I realized I had no Scriptural obligations holding me back. It was just a matter of setting a definite date to start pioneering and then sticking to it. Now I have so many back-calls and studies I could never care for them if I were not pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps there are many of you congregation publishers who can also do what we did and become pioneers. Have you thought about it? Whether you are in your fifties or sixties, your thirties or forties, or whether you are only in your teens or twenties, perhaps you too can share in this blessed privilege of pioneering. If you have never pioneered before, why not start out as a vacation pioneer this March or April? If you are free to do so, we urge you to give it serious and prayerful consideration. And if you can accept this invitation, you too will be very happy in your expanded ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Be assured of our love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your fellow slaves of Jehovah, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pioneers Everywhere</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> This year on Sunday, March 28, we will enjoy the special public talk “Restoration of All Things of Which God Spoke.” And on Friday, April 9, we will observe the Memorial of Christ’s death. In addition to being in attendance ourselves, and having with us Bible students and other interested ones, would it not be thrilling to have in attendance thousands of straying ones, that is, ones who used to be active in Jehovah’s service but who are not now associating?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Thousands? Have thousands become inactive? Yes; during the 1967 to 1970 service years a total of 56,532 in the U.S.A, ceased to be active in Jehovah’s service. If they are once again going to have Jehovah’s blessing and favor they need help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> But someone may think: ‘They know where the Kingdom Hall is and the time of meetings. Isn’t that enough?’ No, often that is not enough, for, while knowing the location of the hall, from a spiritual standpoint they do not know the way back or they do not have the spiritual strength to come back, as was discussed in the July 1, 1969, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> article, “Return to Jehovah While There Is Yet Time.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Many now inactive may well be of the kind described by Jesus at Matthew’ 18:12 as “one that is straying.” If we can help the straying ones to return to Jehovah, it W’ill mean salvation for them, and it will bring joy to our hearts. Jesus said at verse 14, “It is not a desirable thing with my Father . . . for one of these little ones to perish.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> What can we do to help? First of all, endeavor to start a Bible study with, receptive ones, as Bible studies have assisted many who once</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font11"> (A-E) is out of stock, so the Society is unable to fill orders for it. However, there are several thousand copies on hand in congregations in the United States. We suggest that overseers check with nearby congregations either to obtain copies, if they need them, or to share w’hat supply they do have. Any left over, even as few as one or two copies, should be taken to your next circuit assembly. (But please do not return any to the Society.) Sometime during the assembly your circuit servant will announce the number of copies available. Thus, publishers who have not been able to obtain a copy from their congregation should be able to obtain one at their next circuit assembly for use in the Theocratic Ministry School during the months ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">were straying, to regain spirituality. The material to study would depend upon the circumstances of the individual. For example, if one has been inactive for several years, it may be well to review or study the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book with him. Straying ones who have the right heart condition will respond to the spiritual feeding and, before long, resume meeting attendance. Of course, if they do not respond after a period of time, discontinue the study and use the time to help someone truly desirous of learning and serving Jehovah. Incidentally, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font11"> book, page 104, points out that time spent in conducting a Bible study with an inactive publisher may be reported, also the study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It is suggested that the congregation committee make a list of inactive ones in the territory and arrange for capable publishers, pioneers or servants to call on them. Individuals who know of inactive ones can inform the overseer, and if they do not live in the area, send their name and address to the Society. We will be happy to send the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Have many strayed ones been assisted to regain spirituality? We are happy to say that during the 1967 to 1970 period 54,332 were reactivated. Wonderful, isn’t it? You will enjoy the following experience, one of many that could be related: “We arranged for a Bible study with an inactive sister (of six years) and her husband, who had never studied with Jehovah’s witnesses. Almost immediately they began to attend the meetings. Shortly afterward she became active in the ministry again and is now conducting a Bible study with her sister-in-law. During our study we learned that the inactive sister’s daughter was once associated, so a study was arranged with the daughter, and her husband, who had never studied or attended meetings, agreed to sit in. So, as a result of spiritually assisting the strayed sister, not only is she active in Jehovah’s service, but four others are studying the Bible regularly and perhaps one day will join with us in offering sacrifices of praise to Jehovah.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Yes, it may well be that by now giving attention to straying ones many of them will be spiritually assisted to attend meetings with us in March or at least by Memorial time in April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Are Von Having </span><span class="font5">■ffDoem All?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What? Public talks. Are you having them all in your congregation? The Society has made available very interesting material in the form of outlines, and the talks will cover a period of two years or more if one is used every week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When the outlines were provided, servants made arrangements so that there would be speakers prepared and available in every circuit who could give every one of the public talks in a series. However, it has developed in some areas that some of the speakers have moved away and we hear that there are some talks not now assigned in certain circuits. So the question that servants should ask themselves in sponsoring this educational program is whether there is someone in the circuit who is in a position to give each one of the talks. Also, what is being done to present each one of the talks in your congregation for the benefit of the “sheep” in your territory? It will definitely be to the advantage of the entire congregation, and especially those many new ones now associating with the organization if, after two years or so, the same talks </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Bible Studies with Subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We are thrilled to see that so many are subscribers for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> because we know what helpful spiritual information subscribers will regularly receive. If at all possible, we want to help subscribers even more, and this we can do by starting Bible studies whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription offer provides a fine opening for starting a Bible study on the initial call. By including as one of the three free booklets </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom,”</span><span class="font11"> the following easy-to-use presentation has been used to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> On the initial call, after presenting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine and making appropriate comments, one might say, ‘You’ll note here on the cover it says, “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” Some have asked us, Who is Jehovah? Are you acquainted with the name Jehovah? [Let them answer or comment. Whether they say yes or no, you can tactfully go on. ] At Psalm S3:18 note what the Bible tells us about Jehovah. [Let them read the scripture, and thereafter you make appropriate comments.] In this booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom,”</span><span class="font11"> page 5, there is additional information about “The True God,” Jehovah, that will be of interest to you. If you have about ten minutes we can look up these interesting scriptures [point to them in the booklet], which deal with the true God, Jehovah.’</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Having Them All? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">are repeated. It will be possible for the speakers, in the period of two years, to modify their talks and bring them up to date as far as current events and developments are concerned. Thus, if anyone has heard </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> talk in the past, there will be new features about it so it will always be interesting to the listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The speakers have a great responsibility. They should be careful in preparation and make every effort to practice so there will be truly good delivery. Consider<sup>1</sup> who will be present in a meeting. It is important to use language all can grasp and to apply portions of the talk to certain sections of the audience as the outline suggests. The speaker should keep the theme clearly defined in his mind and thoroughly understand the main points in their relation to the theme. Aids such as maps, pictures, slides or other means can add weight to the material and they</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Arrange for a return visit to discuss other interesting points in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet, whetting the householder’s spiritual appetite. Use subjects such as “Jesus Christ,” “Sin, Death, and the Devil,” etc. At an appropriate time the study can be transferred to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The approach outlined in paragraph 3 can be used when making a return call on subscribers, when calling to obtain subscription renewals and on many other occasions. To be effective in using this suggestion, it is necessary to have the points well in mind. Practice sessions for starting Bible studies are very helpful. When waiting for others at rendezvous for field service, as a family, with a pioneer partner and on other informal occasions, one publisher could take the position of a typical householder in the territory and the other could use this or other approaches for starting a Bible study. It is thrilling to share in the Bible study work, as this is the foremost means of helping ones of honest heart to learn the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">may be used, but these must fit what is required, driving home the point clearly and not overshadowing the talk itself or being used simply for entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Make plans now for the 1971 program of activities. You may schedule talks on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font11"> books too if you wish, and handbills may be ordered for these as well as the other talks.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We have observed that in quite a few instances handbill orders are received late. Every effort is being made in the printing department to put the handbill orders through within a day or two after they are received. However, mail service is deteriorating, making shipments slow, so we would like you to allow six weeks for filling handbill orders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Make a special effort in the new year to invite all those who are having home Bible studies and interested persons met on back-calls to attend the public meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">o If one has a question or needs counsel, is there any advantage in writing to the Society, rather than telephoning or visiting the office?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are several advantages, both to you and to the Society. By putting your inquiry in writing, not only do you have an exact record of what you wrote, if you keep a copy, but so does the Society. Experience has shown that, if matters are of importance, it is always best to put them in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When you receive the Society’s letter you will have the advantage of being able to study the answer and the benefit of having something in writing for future reference. Also, the reply in writing gives you the advantage of research and consultation by the brothers in the office, which may be limited when you phone or visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before phoning, visiting or writing to the Society, consider these points: Could you find the answer or counsel in the Society’s publications, thus receiving the obvious benefits of your own research? Have you sought the assistance of your congregation servant or other servants w<sup>r</sup>ho know you and are thus able to give more personal help? (October 1965 “Kingdom Ministry,” “Question Box”; December 15, 1968, “Watchtower,” pages 760-764) Rather frequently, too, some matters may be resolved locally by applying Jesus’ fine counsel at Matthew 18:15-17. We are sure that you can see the decided advantages to you and to the Society if matters can be handled locally in these ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, if an emergency exists or for some reason you need information or counsel immediately, please feel free to contact the Society. We are here to serve you and will gladly do what we can to help you in any time of need.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 1971 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You will be witnesses of me ... to the most distant part of the earth.“—Acts 1: 8. VOL. XIV NO. 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">tyca/t</span><span class="font12"> W)He/iS:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">For years people all over the world have been saying. When will it stop? The price of everything is going up and up—food, clothing, carfare, and now postage. Of course, if you do not write letters, the rise in postage does not affect you. But if you are mailing out millions of magazines every month, in addition to thousands of letters, then it does affect you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On July 1, 1971, throughout the whole world there will be a change in the postage rates. Already in the United States we have felt the effect of the change of first-class postage, and some changes have been made in the postage required for the mailing of magazines. In England the cost of mailing one individual copy of a magazine to a subscriber now is 4.8 cents per copy, which means that it will cost the Society $1.15 to mail </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font11"> the 24 magazines in a year’s subscription. In Germany it will cost the Society 5.5 cents to mail any magazine out of Germany, or $1.32 simply for postage for a year’s subscription. Mailing a magazine to a subscriber in Germany itself would cost about half that much. Word was just received from South Africa that mailing individual copies of any of their South African editions of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> to Europe, South America or Asia will now cost 9.8 cents per copy. From our main mailing centers such as the United States, Canada and Britain, sending an English copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> to a foreign subscriber will cost anywhere from 3 to 4.8 cents per copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In view of this, the Society has decided that it would be wise to make a change in tlie subscription rate in order to cover the cost of postage. Any subscriptions obtained by you during July will still be at the rate of $1 for a year. But beginning August 1, 1971, all new subscriptions and renewals for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines for one year will be $1.50. This</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Work for Those Who Understand</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Understanding originates with Jehovah, lie created man, not like unreasoning beasts, but in ids own image, able to take in knowledge, understand and use it wisely. We are especially interested in understanding his will and purpose, including the book of Revelation. Just recall the joy we had in studying together the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font11"> book at our congregation book studies and how spiritually strengthened we were in feasting on the strong “meat” of the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But Daniel 11: 33 indicates something additional for those who now understand. It says, “And as regards those having insight among the people, they will impart understanding to the many.” Having these precious truths in our heads is not applies to all semimonthly editions in all parts of the world. Monthly editions will be 75 cents a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When bulk supplies are shipped out to congregations, postage will not be as expensive per copy as when mailing to individual subscribers, but the bulk-rate postage has gone up too. So beginning with August 1, 1971, the charge made to congregations for distributors’ copies will be four cents a copy, world wide, in all languages. Still, publishers will continue to offer the magazines to the public at five cents a copy, because we want to keep the price of the magazines within the reach of everyone world wide. No change will be made in the rate for pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If brothers prefer to get their copies through the congregation, they can obtain one copy over the magazine counter at four cents a copy. Getting your copies locally at four cents a copy will cost you only 9G cents a year. However, If you want your magazine mailed directly to your home and you renew your subscription after August 1, then the subscription rate will be $1.50. enough. Heart appreciation that motivates us to show loving concern for others Is included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> “But that is not the easiest bdok to place,” one might think. Possibly, but consider what a special pioneer writes concerning one woman : ‘Back-calls were made, additional literature was placed at each call, but for some reason we could not start a study. She read and enjoyed the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot;</span><span class="font11"> book, but we realized she needed a basic knowledge of the truth. On one call we studied several paragraphs in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book and she agreed we could return and continue. But it was the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot; </span><span class="font11">book that really moved her to see the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and the churches. She</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 2, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font11"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines are doing a wonderful work. As you will observe in the July 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> the printing of each issue will be 7,350,000. The July 8 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> will reach 7,050,000. We firmly believe that circulation of these magazines will continue to rise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While the parcel-post rates on literature have gone up and so have freight rates, the Society does not intend to change the price of its bound books or Bibles. These will remain as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We sincerely hope and pray that the grand witness that is to be given in these “last days” will continue to be given with zeal and earnestness to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We hope to see you at the assembly and that you will enjoy yourself immensely. We know that the program from the very first day will stimulate every one of us to press on in this marvelous work of declaring Jehovah’s name and preaching the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">having home Bible studies may not have heard about these books and they may want copies of some to ‘ ** complete their personal libraries. Remember, too, that thousands of new studies have been started with interested persons who have made progress since we offered the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot;</span><span class="font11"> book last July and these should have the opportunity to obtain it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The April </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry of </span><span class="font11">last year on page two contained two suggestions for presenting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot;</span><span class="font11"> book. This might be reviewed for ideas that you could use. Simplicity was stressed. Read again the suggestions on page eight of the February </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry of</span><span class="font11"> this year for ideas on starting studies with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News&quot;</span><span class="font11"> booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> To understand means to see a thing as a united whole, or to see a matter in its related parts. Thus each publisher should see himself as a part of an organization of hundreds of thousands of wise and understanding ones contributing to a great shout of praise to the One who gave us the book of Revelation and who has now opened its meaning to appreciative ones. Our zeal for and devotion to this work will surely be instrumental in putting ' others on the road to becoming wise and understanding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Advancement in Your Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Working for Jehovah is a joy. And that joy grows if we continue to make advancement. The apostle Paul urged Timothy: “Ponder over tllese things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:15) We, too, can make advancement. And we will do so if we do as Paul advised Timothy, that is, if we ponder over the things in God’s Word and become absorbed in applying what it says.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In every congregation there is much work to be done, and there is a need for willing workers. Do you make yourself available? It would be a fine thing to do. This does not mean trying to maneuver tilings so that you become more prominent in the congregation. It means going out of your way to do things for your brothers and sisters, encouraging them, working with them in the field service, building them up spiritually. It means offering help, if possible, when there is extra work to be done at the Kingdom Hall. It includes fulfilling the assignments given you in connection with the meetings, and doing so, not to amuse or entertain the audience, but to upbuild the congregation in a spiritual way. The desire to do these things, and the ability \to do them well, result from diligent</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That They Should Turn to God'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Explaining his ministry, the apostle Paul said to King Agrippa: “To the nations I went bringing the message that they should repent and turn to God.” (Acts 2G: 20) Paul showed intense concern for people of all kinds, urging them to turn to God. We all should have that same concern, shouldn’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> People cannot call on Jehovah if they have not heard about him. They need someone to preach to them, and that is why we engage in the field ministry—in all Its various forms. (Rom. 10:13, 14) When we call on them from house to house, we direct their attention to what God says in his Word. We do the same thing in Incidental witnessing. And by placing Bible literature we also endeavor to turn them to God. But, In most cases, these earlier contacts with the truth need to be followed up by a home Bible study If they really are going to become praisers of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In. some territories it is not at . all difficult to start Bible studies, J while In other areas people do not respond as favorably. Regardless of whether your offer of a home Bible study is accepted or not, it is good study of the Bible and applying it in one’s own life. Are you making that kind of advancement?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The pioneer work is another marvelous privilege that is open to many. Are you a pioneer? Is pioneering a goal toward which you are working? It is not something to do only if you have nothing else that fills your time. It is a work for those who value their time and discipline themselves to use it well. Being a good pioneer is not merely a matter of reporting a certain amount of work in the field service. The qualifications for a good pioneer are the same as those for a fine congregation publisher; only, the one who pioneers is in position to devote more time to the actual field ministry. Both should cultivate a genuine love for the ministry and a deep concern for the people in the territory. Both should feel motivated to use every opportunity to help sincere ones to know Jehovah and his wonderful purposes. Both should be constantly alert to ways to improve their field ministry. Both should be keenly aware of the importance of leading morally clean lives and manifesting the fruitage of the spirit in everything that they do. Are you making advancement in these ways?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> One’s responding to the call to serve where the need is greater can to make sure that people know about it. Who knows? It may start them thinking, and perhaps they will agree to study when another Witness calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Recognizing the value of home Bible studies in the work of making disciples, we all do well to seek to improve our effectiveness in starting studies. Many suggestions have been offered in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> Some may suit you better than others. One approach may be better for a certain situation than another. But they all require practice. If we have learned various methods, we can be versatile. Perhaps we can l&gt;enefi-cially work on involving the householder in conversation, asking timely questions and then learning to listen to what he says. This may stimulate his interest, opening the way for a study. To improve your effectiveness in starting home Bible studies, do you ever practice your presentation on another member of your family or another publisher and discuss it together?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Perhaps you have never conducted a Bible study. You may often have thought that you would like to, but you wondered whether you could also be evidence of advancement. Not everyone can make such a move, but many have done so. They were able to shake loose from some of the restraints that material interests imposed on what they could do in Jehovah’s service. They moved to the territory of a congregation that needed help on the servant body, or that was looking for aid in covering its territory with the good news. Some have been able to use their abilities to help to build Kingdom Halls in these areas. The resulting blessings have brought much joy to their hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Of course, serving where the need is greater may not require making a move. There may be areas right within your congregation’s territory that have not been worked for a long time. Why not check with the magazine-territory servant and find out what the situation is.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Truly, all of us can move ahead. Some are able to move out into new fields of service—as pioneers, missionaries or Bethel family members. And, if they qualify, they should be encouraged to do so. But, whether we can take up such work or not, we can learn to make better use of our time. We can take fuller advantage of the opportunities that are open to us in the field ministry and within the congregation. We can study God’s Word more diligently and seek to apply It more fully in our own lives. If we ponder over these things and become absorbed in them, advancement will not be a rare event, but a regular part of our lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">really do it. Here is a suggestion: Go to someone in the congregation who does conduct Bible studies and has had success in aiding others to become praisers of Jehovah. Ask that publisher if you can go along with him a few times to observe how he handles his studies. This will enable you to benefit from his experience. Then, with faith that Jehovah will help you, offer your own services to the people on whom you call. Let them know that you would be glad to conduct a regular Bible study with them free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> Even if you do not yet feel qualified to conduct a study, you can still let people know about the free home Bible study arrangement. Then, if you find someone who shows interest in a study, take along another publisher who has had experience in conducting studies. The Bible study servant or your book study servant will be happy to arrange fof someone to go with you on the return call. In this way we can effectively work together in both finding and feeding these sheeplike I ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Value of Preparation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember a recent public talk that you listened to during which the hour just flew by? How about a student talk in the Theocratic Ministry School that gripped your attention? We all have enjoyed such presentations. But, to be that effective, do you know what they all had to have in common? That’s right— preparation!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To be effective in any feature of the ministry, preparation is vital. Even those favored with unusual natural ability need to prepare in order to avoid rambling or failing to get quickly to the point. In many instances the amount of time granted us by the householder is very limited. How satisfying it is to present the truth with telling effect,' using choice words to convey the precious truth with conviction. Often this leads to an extended testimony then and there, but, if not, possibly you will put across a point that will not be forgotten by the householder and might cause him to listen much more attentively the next time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Preparation shows respect. On the platform it shows respect for the audience, and on the doorstep it shows respect for the householder who agrees to listen. At all times it shows respect for Jehovah, whom we represent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We enjoy very much the freedom of choice we have in what we will present and how we will present it at the doors. But because of the uncertainty of what might develop, does this mean less preparation? No, it really requires more preparation in order to be ready for various situations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> How and when can we prepare? Some preparation can be done in the quiet of your home in personal study. The Scriptural presentation can be gone over privately. Determine where questions can be asked to involve the householder. Then discussion and practice sessions can be held within the family circle. One of the best ways for a servant or mature publisher to aid a new one is to ask, “May I stop by your home and show you how I prepare?” If the mature one accepts the responsibility for teaching the new one and just lovingly shows how he goes about preparing, there need be no embarrassment in a discussion and practice session.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> Preparing to serve Jehovah in the field is a joy. We are all busy and may find it difficult to set aside the time we would like, but even a few minutes here and there will make for marvelous improvement. On a day when one cannot be in the field, it is a pleasure to pick up the Bible and review a Scriptural presentation, silently or aloud. It keeps us service-minded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Some brothers keep a little looseleaf notebook with brief outlines of their favorite sermons, common objections found in their territories and ways of overcoming them, also </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> suggestions for starting home Bible studies. It can be kept in your witnessing case. Do you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The apostle Paul asked the brothers to pray for him, “that ability to speak may be given me with the opening of my mouth, with all freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news.” (Eph. 6:19) We, too, have need for that same ability to speak. Preparation Is valuable to that end.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Another excellent report! It is marvelous to see, after reaching the outstanding peak of 416,789 publishers in April, the fine total of 414,210 publishers reporting in May, just 2,579 less. Truly consistent and loving service!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">And that you were interested in helping those with whom literature was placed is shown in that 339,912 studies were conducted, which is 30,899 more than we conducted last May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, the work continues its steady, forward movement that we so much enjoy observing. Truly a grand witness was given in May as you brothers kept on showing yourselves willing to be used by Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question d3ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• What can each one of us do to keep the Kingdom Hall clean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Kingdom Hall is the center for pure worship in the community. When it is kept clean and attractive inside and out, it can serve to represent </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a </span><span class="font10">Jehovah and his organization in </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">p // </span><span class="font10">fine way. All associated with the co* gregation can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ \</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Usually the congregation servant '* works out a schedule for the various congregation book study groups to take turns in cleaning the hall. It is helpful if there is a list of things that need to be done each week. When your study group’s turn comes, be sure to do your part. But what about at other times?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There may be some things you can do to help each week. In some congregations younger publishers working together after each meeting pick up things on the floor and straighten the chairs. In some congregations a family group has taken on this responsibility. The result is, of course, that the appearance of the hall is always very fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Parents do well to teach their children to pick up things that fall on the floor, and they ought to see that their children are not responsible for writing on chairs or walls, or defacing the property in any way. Kingdom Hall cleaning can be a very enjoyable time. It offers a good opportunity for parents to train children to accept responsibility and to show appreciation for Jehovah’s place of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Does the outside of your Kingdom Hall need attention? Is the shrubbery kept well and the grass cut? Be alert at all times to things needing attention. Our faithfulness in looking after the Kingdom Hall gives evidence of our love for Jehovah and our desire that his place of worship be a good witness in the community.</span></p>

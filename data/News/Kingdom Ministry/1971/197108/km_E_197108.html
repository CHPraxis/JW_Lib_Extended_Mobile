<p><span class="font8">AUGUST 1971 “You will be witnesses of me ... to the most distant part of the earth.*’—Acts 1: 8. VOL. XIV NO. 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">By now most of us are back home after attending one of the many “Divine Name” District Assemblies. They were certainly royal banquets of spiritual food—so faithstrengthening and so timely in these “last days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Surprises! Surprises! There seemed to be no end to the surprises. As each day’s program unfolded there was a constant flow of new things learned and old principles emphasized. It was most refreshing to see how much of the program was devoted to helping us to improve our relationship to Jehovah personally. Many favorable comments also were heard about the fine help given to strengthen the bond of love between brothers and their ties to the organi-zatlon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">' All indications point to a recordbreaking attendance at these district assemblies this year. For the first twelve assemblies held in the United States and Canada there was a total attendance of 212,217. Those baptized at these assemblies, 3,734.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And now that the assemblies are practically over with, do you think the Bethel Family will have little to do? All indications around here definitely say </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">No!</span><span class="font9"> For example, in late June and early July we received three new rotary presses from Germany. And in the middle of July two more of these presses started to be hauled up from the docks. Then In September we are scheduled to receive five more of these big high-speed rotary magazine presses. Each press will print between 12,000 and 13.000 magazines per hour. So in the months ahead these ten new presses will be able to add upwards of 1,000,000 more magazines </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">per day </span><span class="font9">to the production!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We know that you too rejoice with us here at Bethel at seeing how marvelously Jehovah is blessing our efforts to publicize the Divine Name and the Kingdom of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again be assured of our warm love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Declaring Jehovah's Name</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> By Jehovah’s manner of dealing with Pharaoh we are able to understand why Jehovah has tolerated Satan down through the centuries until now. As recorded at Exodus 9:15, 16, Jehovah told Pharaoh how he could easily have destroyed him, but “for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.” In Pharaoh’s day, Jehovah used his visible representatives, Moses and Aaron, to speak his message and declare his name as Jehovah carried out his purpose in Egypt. What a privilege it was for them to declare Jehovah’s name!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Now in our day too Jehovah has his visible representatives on the earth, and what a privilege it is for ns to be witnesses of Jehovah, declaring his name in all the earth. How we have rejoiced to see Jehovah adding increase upon increase and swelling the declaration to his praise in all lands! The name of Jehovah has become well known because his witnesses are present among the people. Jehovah has provided his Word, which we as his servants declare, and through his organization he has made it convenient for us to reach many millions by use of the printed page.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In August we are happily distributing bound books that bring praise to Jehovah’s name. Soon the time will be here for the greatest demonstration of Jehovah’s power, so it is appropriate that we draw the world’s attention to the meaning of the book of Revelation and this we can do through the publication </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.&quot;</span><span class="font9"> We continue to feature that book in August. However, since other publications also consider God’s purpose to vindicate his name and destroy the wicked, August will be a good month to place any or all of the books that are offered for the same contribution as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot;</span><span class="font9"> book, such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie,’ Life Everlasting, “'Your 'Will lie Done,&quot;</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Sanctified.&quot;</span><span class="font9"> If congregations have an excess stock of tliose publications, we urge them to take the books from the shelves and put them into the hands of the people. Any of the books may be offered during August.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> While we may use any sermon or presentation of our choice, and we should try to find one most effective in our particular territory, our theme for the month may remind us of a sermon on God’s name, which we have used so profitably in times past. It can fit in with the presentation of any one of the books and will magnify the name Jehovah. Often we meet people who are friendly and tell us we ‘are doing a good work.’ Can we help those people to see that there is an issue involved and they have to keep taking in knowledge of him and to call upon the name of Jehovah to be saved?—John 17:3; Rom. 10:13; Prov. 18:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In so many ways today men deny the existence of God. Others openly reproach him. What should be our reaction? Should it not be like that of David who visited the encampment of the armies of Israel and heard Goliath’s taunts? Although not one man in all the armies of Israel then showed concern and faith enough to stand up for the honor of Jehovah, David’s heart moved him to accept the challenge and declare the name of Jehovah before two entire armies. In the name of Jehovah David went out to battle and was given the victory; the reproach was taken away, Jehovah’s name was honored. Today we want to be like David. We are concerned as we hear so many reproaches against Jehovah God. Deep down in our hearts we are aroused to accept the challenge every time and take Jehovah’s side of the issue as his witnesses, declaring Jehovah’s name in all the earth.—1 Sam. 17: 26, 45-47; Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p></li></ul>

Biology teachers may be better acquainted with the book this semester because the editor of the national magazine &quot;The American Biology Teacher” (January 1971 issue) recommended: “Teachers who wish to become more familiar with creationists’ arguments should read ’Did Man Get Here by Evolution or Creation?’ published in 1967 by the Watcli Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and available locally from Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Students can offer it to any teacher who did not receive it previously and to new classmates also.

This shows that adults and youths alike can have their thinking ability aroused by this subject and are quick to take a publication that presents factually the case against the theory of evolution. “Kingdom Ministry,” of August and September 1970 under “Your Service Meetings,” has some good suggestions on arousing the thinking ability of people so we can place the &quot;Evolution” book.

<p><span class="font8">While many of us w<sup>T</sup>ere preparing, traveling or attending one of the district assemblies, which started June 30, we commendably arranged our affairs to have a good share in the ministry. Our combined effort throughout the month resulted in 738,974 Bibles and books being placed. Excellent indeed! It is interesting to note that, on the average, each special pioneer placed 21.4, regular pioneers 11.2, vacation pioneers 10.5 and publishers 1/2. Yes, people were responsive to our taking the initiative to discuss with them Bible truths and, as we make return visits, undoubtedly many will eagerly respond to our invitation to have a Bible study.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The booklet by this name was released following the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1950. It outlines the procedure when an arrest occurs and a trial ensues. It also contains a Memorandum of Law showing that the courts have held the placing of literature, either from door to door or upon the streets by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the acceptance of contributions therefor to be legal, and that authorities cannot require the paying of a tax for that privilege on the theory that the work comes under commercial laws regulating hawking, selling, peddling, soliciting, etc. The Supreme Court of the United States, according to one decision, said, rather, that our work is ‘missionary evangelism,’ protected by the state and federal constitutions guaranteeing freedom of speech, press and worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> But what if some overly zealous police officer, either on his own initiative or on complaint of a householder, states that you cannot continue your work? He may be unfamiliar with the fact that our work has been legally approved by the courts, so it would not be proper to take a belligerent attitude and retort that you are going [ 3 continue your work whether he Likes it or not. Rather, tell him you are a minister of Jehovah’s &quot;witnesses, showing him your identification card provided by the congregation servant, and inform him that your work of preaching the gospel and accepting free-will contributions for the religious literature has been approved by state and federal courts. You can agree to go with him to police headquarters to discuss the matter with his superior officer. Usually the policeman will be satisfied and tell you to go ahead with your work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If he insists that you desist or he will arrest you, and places you under arrest, you can explain at police headquarters that you were not selling anything but preaching the gospel as a minister and merely accepting a nominal contribution toward the work to cover the bare cost of the literature. By reference to the above-mentioned legal booklet (a copy of which should be in each theocratic ministry library) you should be familiar with court opinions that have been rendered on various subjects, especially in your state, so as to be able to speak ^jwith some knowledge on the matter. If you are told that there is an ordinance prohibiting your work, ask for a copy of it and send it to the Society along with complete details, including the names of the chief of police and the city attorney, so counsel can be given and appropriate letters written.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Should you ignore “No Solicitors” signs? It should be remembered that our work is not commercial. Accordingly we conclude that the sign just does not have any application to our gospel preaching. We do not solicit funds. We leave with people life-giving information for which they may make free-will contributions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> You may be refused entrance into an apartment building or trailer court. This is not at all unusual. Often there may be a doorman or an elevator operator blocking your entrance. If there is no way at all to make personal calls, you may be able to make a list of the tenants and apartment numbers and write to the occupants. If there is no one on duty, then go ahead with the work in the usual way. If, while you are in a place, the superintendent or manager asks you to leave, identify yourself</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Are We Friends as</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Bad associations spoil useful habits”! How often we have heard this basic truth declared I Yet, the thought of the opposite reaction, ‘Good associations cultivate good habits,’ has sound Scriptural backing.—1 Cor. 15:33; Prov. 13:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> This principle can be applied to our own Bible students. How can we replace their present friends, some of whom may be honest, sincere people, but who are not good associates as far as the truth is concerned? We must be more than teachers of these students. We must help the students to make friends among true Christians. We must be friends of these students ourselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Right in the congregation is one place where we can begin to help them to find good friends. In this regard one couple said: “We show hospitality by Inviting them to our home where they find theocratic companionship and fellowship. We try’to have other brothers and sisters and families around their own age-group so that they can make fine new friends. . . . We try to get the newly interested ones to meetings Immediately. . . . We take them to conventions with us.” Another couple who over the years have brought hundreds of people to a knowledge of the truth explained how they gained success: &quot;Making close and intimate friends..., not having just a mechanical teacher-student rela-and explain tactfully and kindly that you are in the ministry and doing good for the tenants. If he insists that you leave, comply with his request without making a ‘scene’ and try to return from time to time until the place Is covered completely. There are some apartment building owners who have incorporated in their leases stipulation that allows them to determine who shall or shall not call on the tenants. If the tenants are willing to let their landlords make such important decisions for them, they place themselves under the “community responsibility” rule and we shall not insist on making calls on them; in fact, we are legally barred from doing so. Some may be contacted when we engage in street magazine activity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> The courts have held that laws allowing door-to-door and street preaching by Jehovah’s witnesses, only upon permit from some official, are unconstitutional. There are still many communities, however, that insist that we comply with registra-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Well as Teachers?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">tionship. . . . Inviting them over to our house. In general, being generous, kind and hospitable seems to be contagious and a fine, close, loving family-type relationship usually develops. Soon they reciprocate by having the friends over to their house; before long they have nothing but theocratic association, causing them to mature quickly.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Numerous other possibilities exist that will help us to build a closer bond of frieiidship with our Bible students. For example: We can make friendly telephone calls. We can visit museums to see artifacts that help to prove the Bible record. A trip to the country or a visit to a park will help them to appreciate the wonders of creation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> On such excursions there is one key to having success in winning them over as Christian friends: In each situation have points in mind that will show them the value of the Bible truths and the Christian way of life. Our Christian conduct will continually attract these people who have the right heart condition. We can have a pleasant time with them enjoying an evening of conversation, sharing experiences and talking about the truth. However, we must be alert to avoid involving ourselves in social activities they may want to organize if such are detrimental to Christian welfare.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Seek the Most Effective Way</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Have you considered your habits in presenting the good news? Is there something more that you can do to impress those whom you meet? For example, have you thought of how well you maintain eye contact with a person? If you are preaching and look the other person in the eye (when you do not have to read something) your presentation takes on a more positive impact. You can be more convincing. If you stare off into space while you talk, as though fishing for the next idea, someone may question whether you believe what you say or whether you know your subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Furthermore, looking another in the eye can be very revealing. People’s eyes tell many things; you sense their reaction. If the person is angry it will show. If he really is not interested, you will be able to see it. You can tell when he doesn’t understand you or follow your reasoning. If he is getting impatient you can usually tell it. You have everything to gain by such good eye contact, for you can make appropriate moves, adjust your pace or try to arouse more interest by bringing in another thought.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Establishing eye contact can be very effective in street magazine service. A publisher in Puerto Rico reports that by making a conscientious effort to do this as people approached on the street and then speaking to them, it has been possible to place many magazines each day.

In each instance we could insist on our right and force the matter into the courts.

So we will agree to comply when town authorities request that we comply with such ordinances </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">but only if there is no fee involved. </span><span class="font9">However, this does not mean that we will voluntarily offer to comply with permit ordinances, because most officials agree it is not required that we do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The message we have is a happy, pleasant one. Therefore our facial expression ought to reflect similar sentiments. Do you smile when you approach someone? Are you friendly? A winning smile attracts. It lias often been noted by news reporters and visitors at conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses that there are so many happy faces. It makes a definite impression for good.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We have the truth, and we know it. Therefore it is appropriate that we present it in a very positive way. When we speak, our manner should be witli conviction, not simple recitation as if memorized, and our sincerity or earnestness will add force to what we have to say. If one is an ambassador representing a government, he looks out for the interests of his government and speaks out for it in a very positive way. Christian ministers serve as ambassadors or envoys for God’s kingdom, representing an actual government, the kingdom of heaven. They imitate Christ in every possible way. (Matt. 7:28, 29; Acts 4:13; 2 Cor. 5:20) By keeping a clear vision of our commission to speak God’s message we can do so in a bold and positive manner, though at the same time we are tactful and kind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> First impressions are often lasting ones. So we ought to be aware of our appearance as we approach people to present the good news of the Kingdom, not only in cleanness and neatness, but in our manner and our speech.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Question /-^ox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">• What should be the goal of the concluding comments presented at the service meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Certainly the goal should be to stimulate our desire to share in the ministry in various ways and to attend meetings during the coming week. While the “Lamp&quot; book on page 54 mentions that field service arrangements are outlined for the days ahead, it is not necessary to go into great detail, giving many at' dresses or times of meetings. Ther5.<sup>r </sup>might be something special on certain holidays. Furthermore, lengthy announcements often may be included in the first part of a meeting. Then the congregation servant can use the final part of the meeting for a discussion of upbuilding Scriptural thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should not be necessary to give all the details about the forthcoming meetings. The one concluding a meeting might ask himself. What would be important or stimulating for me to hear? It is important to remind all if on the next service meeting a particular magazine will be considered and everyone should bring It. It would be stimulating to give the title for the coming public meeting rather than simply saying there will be a public meeting. The one presenting the closing remarks should try to give crisp, interesting statements that do not drag. It is good to avoid reading personal postcards or letters from individuals in the congregation who may be away on vacation. If a member of the congregation is ill, visiting may be mentioned. It is beneficial for all who attend the meeting to go home with spiritual thoughts so reference can be made to the theme of the service meeting and how it applies in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If others assigned to parts in the service meeting exceed their allowed time, the brother handling concluding comments will have to cut short his part in order to observe the one-hour meeting limit.</span></p>

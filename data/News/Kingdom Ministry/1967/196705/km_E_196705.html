<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> If anyone were to ask us here at Bethel whether the Kingdom work is progressing, our answer certainly would have to be yes. It makes us very happy, for the reason why our work increases is that the congregations and brothers throughout the field are increasing their activity. Since March 1 it has been necessary for us to call in 110 for Bethel service, and the Bethel family now has 782 working at Brooklyn and 80 at the three farms, making a total of 862. We have had to open up a third dining room to accommodate the Bethel family plus the 50 brothers attending the Kingdom Ministry School and the 104 students at the Gilead School. But it is still possible for the family to get acquainted because closed-circuit television has been installed In the dining rooms and those who comment on the morning text or give experiences are seen. Additionally, closed-circuit television is installed in the Kingdom Hall and some of the rooms in the Gilead School, thus the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">study and Theocratic Ministry School sessions held in the Kingdom Hall can be observed by all in attendance, even though they cannot fit into the Bethel Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Orders have come in heavily for the special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> making this the highest printing we have ever had of any special magazine. For the first three campaign months 487,806 new subscriptions were received, compared to last year’s 364,653, an Increase this year of 123,153 new subscriptions or about 33 percent. There has been good response to making gifts of subscriptions and it is estimated that over 100 a day on the average are being received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Additionally, we have many orders for books and It is quite a problem to make enough books for all the different countries in many languages. The factory buildings are cramped for space now; so we all look forward to the completion of the new building. Currently the builders are working on</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">SUCCESS!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A11 of us want to be successful in our field ministry—we want It to be an honor to Jehovah—don’t we? Well, what about your efforts in service? Are they successful?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When you say you have had a ‘good day in service’ or a ’poor day,' what do you have ip mind? Take the house-to-house 'work, for instance. Is it a “good day” only when you get a hearing ear or when you place literature? The goodness in service is determined by more than by merely placing literature or making contacts. The first question is, Did you succeed in accomplishing your ministry as commissioned? We realize that there Is a main reason for going in the house-to-house work. Our sharing in the ministry is also an act of worship on our part. Before Jehovah, the angels, the demons and humans, we declare by our activity that we are on Jehovah's side of the issue of universal sovereignty. Our sharing in the field ministry successfully accomplishes this whether we get hearing ears, place literature or not. So we need to keep a balanced view of things, don’t we?—Isa. 43: 10, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Further, if we succeed In talking to even one person and In conversation discuss only one point from the Scriptures, we have succeeded in sowing seeds of truth. A foreign-speaking brother told of his experience after being encouraged to use questions in the ministry to get people to think. A lady indicated that she was too busy to talk. The the eighth floor and we hope to have occupancy by October.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The Bethel family rejoice In the privilege of serving with you and seeing the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon the Kingdom work. We hope you are having many happy experiences in the ministry and much joy in looking after your theocratic responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bbooklyn Bbanch Office </span><span class="font11">brother said: “Well, before I go I would like to ask you one question : ‘What do you think It will be like down here on earth when God’s will Is done on earth, as we pray In the Prayer?”’ “I’m really in too much of a hurry to discuss it now,” she said and shut the door. Success? Or not?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Fifteen minutes later this lady and her neighbor were walking down the street and, unknown to them, they passed a car in which a publisher was sitting. Their conversation was about the brother who had called at their doors that morning. One said: “You know, he asked me what I thought it would be like when God’s will is done on earth. Well, no one has ever asked me that question before.” “I wonder what it will be like?” the neighbor asked as they went beyond the hearing of the publisher. Yes, the seed was sown. And who knows how many hearts it fell on as these two ladies kept repeating the question that had been asked them by the brother who had indeed been successful in his service that morning.—Luke 8:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It may be the handbill you slipped under the door that first acquainted someone with the truth. It may be your calling at their door that caused the family inside to discuss Jehovah and his witnesses, even though they did not answer your call and talk to you. Or it may be the conversation you had with someone in the territory that resulted In Jehovah’s name and purposes being spread abroad in the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It will be an added success if we place literature with householders and if they read it Most of us can make progress in effectively presenting the good news in our territory. So, ask yourself: ‘How can I make my presentations more appealing and effective to those who live in my territory?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Jehovah Makes One Rich Spiritually. Song 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 mln: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “Success!’’ Briefly consider article, with questions and answers. Read paragraphs 2, 5 and 7. Then call on two sisters to report from their seats on the results of their recent field service activity. Perhaps one placed two books and several magazines while in the service for several hours. The other may have been in the service for the same period of time and succeeded In presenting her sermon to one person and made no placements. Thereafter entertain comments from the congregation: In what ways were both sisters successful In their service to Jehovah, and why do you say so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: Call on congregation to suggest talking points In “Life Everlasting” and &quot;Impossible to Lie&quot; books that can be used in effectively presenting them in the local territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: &quot;If We Live, We Live to Jehovah.&quot; Encourage publishers to prepare ahead of time just as they would for &quot;Watchtower” study. Cover material thoroughly with questions and answers. Time should not be consumed with lengthy introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: Concluding comments. Consider high points of branch letter and local congregation report. Accounts report. Song 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Do Good to Others. Song 23. 5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 mln: Do Good to Those Related to You In the Faith. (Gal. 6:10) Publisher calls on brother or sister who has missed meetings. Asks if any way he can help. Deliver &quot;Kingdom Ministry.” Share appropriate 'news and announcements’ from &quot;Kingdom Ministry&quot; and from local congregation; also something of spiritual value from meetings. Make visit upbuilding, refreshing, encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: Good Results from Aiding Others. Consider &quot;Yearbook” experiences in interesting, colorful way. Use what you have time for. See 1967 &quot;Yearbook,” pages 82, 85, 93, 97, 98, 233, 234. Encourage publishers to do good for one another In harmony with what is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: &quot;Don’t Miss Any Part of the Assembly Program!” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">. Co</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ncluding comments. Read article “What a Pleasure!” Comment that overseer has a list of unassigned territories if someone wishes to examine it. (Use 1964 Unassigned Territory booklet and supplement sheet for 1966.) Also, there are many congregations in the United States that have large territories, some of which is seldom worked. So if someone is planning a trip and would like to do some work in unassigned territory, or in congregation territory that is seldom worked, this can be arranged. Those who wish may write the Society, telling of their plans for the summer, where they hope to travel or witness, and asking for further Information regarding territory. Song 97.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Keep Busy in the Work of the Lord. Song 116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: &quot;Presenting the Good News— with ‘Awake!’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;&nbsp;Briefly cover</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> material with questions and answers. Then call for suggestions from congregation. Chairman could read titles from several current and past issues of &quot;Awake!&quot; and ask publishers to suggest to whom these issues might particularly appeal and why. Encourage congregation to follow these suggestions when future issues of “Awake!” contain appropriate articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: Start Studies in House-to-House Work. Demonstrate two or three possible introductions. Some publishers have been saying: ’The purpose of my call is to encourage more Bible reading at home. To do this we have been taking a few minutes to give a free demonstration from your own Bible on how you can get information that is of a practical nature. For example: We have been discussing four texts on the subject “The True God.” Do you have your Bjble handy? . . .’ If the householder accepts your offer, you could use the scriptures and the material presented on page five of &quot;This Good News of the Kingdom.” Some publishers have been using the same introduction but asking the householder to look up the scriptures in the current sermon and read them from his own Bible. For other ideas see November 1965 &quot;Kingdom Ministry,” page four, and July 1966 &quot;Kingdom Ministry,” page four. Ask congregation for additional comments as to how they would start the study if householder agreed to study. Encourage publishers to do this in house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: “Preparing Now for Future Progress.” Questions and answers. Encourage publishers to prepare ahead of time for lively consideration. Chairman should spend time covering printed material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 min: Concluding comments. Question Box: Comment on arrangements already made or to be made for someone to handle funerals locally. Song 93.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Paying Fully What We Owe God. Song 79.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: Introduction, text, comments and talk on theme for the month, based on “Watchtower” of June 1, 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: Continue to Serve Jehovah with Your Whole Heart. Discussion with congregation: (1) Ask publishers WHY they arrange their affairs to have a regular part In Jehovah’s service, while some are slowing down and quitting. Encourage giving of Scriptural reasons as well as personal reasons. (2) Ask WHY they keep calling at homes where householders say they were not interested, or when little literature may be placed. (3) Ask HOW publishers can help one another to keep busy and happy In Jehovah’s service. Encourage as many publishers as possible to express their thoughts. (For additional points and scriptures, see article entitled &quot;Why?” on page 7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: Discuss with congregation the offer for June and talking points that could be used in presenting it. Briefly demonstrate sermon and offer. The sermon &quot;Time to Rejoice” used in May may be used. Chairman should assure local publishers that if they desire to use another sermon they may look through &quot;Sermon Outlines” for ideas and use anything they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 mln: What Will a Christian Pray For? Consider subjects that Christians can properly Include in prayer. See &quot;Watch Tower Publications Index” under &quot;PRAYER” and subheading &quot;right matters.” Many subjects are listed and helpful references such as “Watchtower” for 1963, pages 116, 165-167; &quot;Watchtower” for 1964, pages 557-565; &quot;Watchtower” for 1958, pages 501, 504-506. See also &quot;Awake!” February 8, 1967, page 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">10 min: Concluding comments. Song</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Success! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What Interesting points can I turn to in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Impossible to Lie&quot;</span><span class="font11"> book as I offer either, together with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c during May?’ This is something for us to discuss among ourselves privately and at meetings. It would be a good matter for family members to consider together. Knowing of the abundance of valuable Scriptural Information in these publications, we will want to be most enthusiastic in offering them during May to everyone we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is a source of inward joy to know that you are a worker in God’s field, isn’t it? Yes, we plant and water the seeds of truth. As to the results—remember, it is God who makes it grow. (1 Cor. 3:7, 8) May Jehovah bless you richly as you energetically continue in your successful Kingdom ministry to his praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1967 336,029 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">An outstanding witness was accomplished during March! When 316,301 publishers have a part in Jehovah's service, a lot of talking is done and a lot of people hear something about Jehovah and his kingdom. That is the greatest number of publishers In the service since April 1966, when we had 318,559.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We placed 900,000 more magazines than we did during February—over 5,000,000 were placed in March! Think of all the good that was accomplished as these were read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But we saved the best for last: A new peak of 260,655 home Bible studies were conducted in March! Why is this so encouraging? It is because through home Bible studies new ones are best aided to learn the truth and become praisers of Jehovah. Aren’t you glad that you had some share in this grand witness?</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>&quot;IF WE LIVE, WE LIVE TO JEHOVAH&quot;</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> How much pleasure it brings us as dedicated servants of God to reflect on our purpose in living! Because of our relationship to Jehovah we no longer ‘live with regard to ourselves only/ as is often the case in the world, but we live with regard to Jehovah and for the purpose of honoring him. —Rom. 14:7; 1 Pet. 4:2; 2:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> We can easily see that in the animal realm creatures are dominated by the instinct to survive, but with humans it can be different. They can live, not simply to survive, but to accomplish something of value in life. Yet how frequently we meet humans who are, in essence, governed by no more than the same drives that control the animals. Most persons around us prove by their endless search for pleasure and their devotion to their worldly careers that they ‘live with regard to themselves only.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> But the apostle Paul drew attention to the fact that it is not this way with Christians. The dominating desire in our lives is to honor Jehovah. So, with us this desire should become the pivot around which all the affairs in our lives turn. It should influence what subjects young folks study in school, how we use our vacations, the type of employment we accept, what we do with our “free” time. As long as we live, which can be forever, we have the grand privilege to “live to Jehovah.”—Rom. 14:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes, though, it does us good to stop and analyze what we are doing with our lives, to contemplate the extent to which we are truly living our lives to Jehovah. (2 Cor. 5:15) Whether you are still free to make major adjustments in how you will shape your personal future or are already in a position where, to a large extent, your responsibilities limit what you can do, such an examination will benefit you. Your analysis likely will give you reason for satisfaction in that you already have let your desire to honor God influence many of your decisions and actions. It may also reveal opportunities you still have to “live to Jehovah” in a more complete sense.—1 Thess. 4:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> While all dedicated Christians are fulltime ministers of the “good news,” not all have been able to arrange their circumstances so as to be full-time preachers, as pioneers have. On the average, each month last year there were 50,760 brothers and sisters of all ages happily sharing in some branch of pioneer service or as members of Bethel families. Even though many personally were not included in that number, it should make their hearts glad to know that so many were able to do what every mature Christian desires to do, that is, live to Jehovah in such a capacity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> As you examine your own personal circumstances, though, possibly you can see some way that you can guide your life so as to increase the time you have to do that which gives purpose and meaning to our lives, namely, praise Jehovah. (Ps. 146:1, 2; 147:1) For example, shortly many of you young Christians will be completing your schooling. You will be standing, as it were, at the portals of your adult life. Why not ask yourself, ‘What am I going to do with my future?’ If you earnestly love Jehovah, your answer will be made in relation to your dedication to him. You will not be like those in the world who plan their future simply around material needs and desires. Rather, you will take the view expressed by Paul: “None of us, in fact, lives with regard to himself only, ... if we live, we live to Jehovah.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> This is probably the most opportune time for you to enter the pioneer service, before you assume responsibilities that would make accepting such a privilege more difficult. Now is the time when you are thinking about employment. Could it be that by exerting yourself you could find part-time employment that would permit you to “live to Jehovah” as a pioneer minister? Many in your congregation would love to have the freedom you now have to decide what you will do with your life. But you are the one who has it. Decide wisely!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>s</sup>At a large assembly in California the wife of a district servant related what happened when she was in this position. It seems that she was torn between serving Jehovah and pursuing worldly pleasures with her schoolmates. She said: “One night my mother had a long heart-to-heart talk with me, and I realized that I was going to have to come to some sort of decision as to what I was going to do with my life.” The course she chose involved working toward and entering the pioneer service. After being a regular pioneer, special pioneer, missionary and the wife of a district servant, she commented about her decision:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> “Since then every joyful thing that has happened in my life has come as a result of the full-time ministry. I really feel that the pioneer work saved my life. If I had it to live over again, I would live it in exactly the same way!”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> Undoubtedly thousands of you housewives, husbands, and schoolchildren would be thrilled to be pioneers, missionaries, or members of the Bethel family. But your present circumstances may make such a possibility seem quite remote. When you examine your situation, though, you may find that there is a way you could adjust your life. If you are holding a full-time job, have you given prayerful consideration to the possibility of looking for employment that demands less time? If you found such, you would have more time to give public expression to your real purpose in living: honoring Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Those who have organized their lives so as to share in the pioneer work have been richly blessed. A sister who began pioneering in 1937 exclaimed: “Jehovah has truly been good to me through these twenty-nine years in the full-time ministry. It has been my pleasure to see over one hundred ‘letters of recommendation,’ including pioneers, special pioneers, district servants and even Gilead graduates. I have become a grandmother and great-grandmother, even though I have no fleshly children. How much joy I would have cheated myself of if I had not taken up the full-time service.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> One couple, determined to “live to Jehovah” as fully as possible by pioneering, offered to move where the need was greater. They were assigned to a small town in New Hampshire. The husband writes: “I was able, with Jehovah’s help, to provide all the necessities for my wife and myself.” (Ps. 34:10) To do so he took various part-time jobs, including window washing. At times finances were short. Once they had a medical bill but no money to pay it. Did God leave them? Absolutely not! The week the bill was due they learned that it was being reduced by 30 percent because they were ministers. The same week relatives were moved to send them money—exactly enough to cover the bill. The brother concluded: “Experiences like this one happened too many times during the past few years to be mere coincidence. Everything always worked out, proving to us that Jehovah is faithful to his promise, ‘all these other things will be added to you.’ ” —Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> Some, upon personal scrutiny, may find that their Scriptural obligations do not permit sharing in the pioneer ministry at present, though they are zealous publishers. If that is your position, holding a full-time job or being busy with family duties does not mean you are living only to yourself. You still serve Jehovah as often and as much as possible. But what joys you would have if you could show in a further way what your main purpose in life really is by vacation pioneering! You can do that any time during the year. Thousands of husbands and mothers, in positions like yours, regularly give additional evidence of their purpose in living by serving as vacation pioneers. Could you do so in the coming months? You schoolchildren who are quite busy the rest of the year may find that the coming vacation period is a chance to show in an extra way that already you have the proper purpose in life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>14</sup> As in our every activity of life we “live to Jehovah,” we can be sure of his approved and blessing. If we can decrease the time we spend on things for our everyday survival, we may be able to increase our activity in honoring Jehovah, to our everlasting good. Thus we will be demonstrating to an additional degree appreciation for our purpose in living. As the psalmist expressed it: “Cry out joyfully, O you righteous ones, because of Jehovah. On the part of the upright ones praise is fitting.”—Ps. 33:1.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Since you came to a knowledge of the truth of God’s Word, have you made progress^ Undoubtedly every dedicated Christian can answer, Yes! Most likely you have progressed in knowledge, ability in the ministry and appreciation for your relationship to God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Possibly at one time you had only a basic knowledge of some of the “primary doctrine” of the Bible. (Heb. 6:1, 2) Now, though, you may have insight into the deep things of God. In the past you may have been limited to sharing just a few words with persons you met in the service, but now you may be giving Bible sermons, making return visits on interested ones and conducting Bible studies. Once you needed assistance from mature ones; now you may have the privilege of assisting others. Stop and think! What has been your routine?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">’With great joy and inner satisfaction likely you can respond that your routine has been according to how much you have progressed. It has been just as the apostle Paul advised: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” (Phil. 3:16) Having a routine in this sense does not mean to be “in a rut,” unchangeable, without possibility of further progress. Rather, for you to keep walking “in this same routine” means not to retrograde. To be in this type of routine with respect to service privileges, for example, means to live up to your service privileges.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> While there are many areas in which different individuals may make progress, let us center our attention on the marvelous privileges of full-time service available. How many times have you made or heard others make comments such as these: ‘Even though I have family responsibilities, I would like to pioneer’; ‘When I graduate I want to go to Bethel and help print literature for brothers world wide,’ or, ‘Reading the wonderful experiences in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font0"> makes me long to go through Gilead, learn a new language and be a missionary in some foreign land’? These goals may be within your reach. But if you have such fine ambitions, there are some steps you can take now to equip yourself for such privileges.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">’For example, maybe you have dreamed of someday being a regular pioneer. What can you do to prepare yourself for that step? Many have proved that being a vacation pioneer helped them. A sister in Philadelphia writes: “I thought of how wonderful it would be to pioneer. Yet I knew I might have problems since I have two children. So after prayer and careful thought I decided to vacation pioneer.” When that service was completed she had an even greater desire to be a pioneer, and now she was convinced she could do it. She continues: “With my husband’s encouragement and the happy experience of having vacation pioneered, I became a regular pioneer. I have never enjoyed a more wonderful and satisfying experience in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">’This matter of progressing toward one’s goal was also well demonstrated in a case related by a congregation servant. Some years ago a young brother in high school asked the overseer about Bethel. The servant answered his questions and encouraged the lad to vacation pioneer during the summer vacations. For several years the brother did this, all the while receiving training in the Theocratic Ministry School. Upon graduating from high school he took two more steps toward his goal, Bethel: He entered the regular pioneer service and he sent in an application for Bethel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> He was not immediately called to Bethel, so the question arose, What should he do? What would you have done? He continued to pioneer and at the same time became qualified for privileges in the congregation, even delivering a public lecture. After a year of such progress he again applied for Bethel, was accepted and early this year received this privilege he had long worked for. When he had first thought of Bethel service he did not qualify, but he did not just dream about it. He took steps to reach his goal; he equipped himself for the future service privilege he desired.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Maybe it is your aim to serve at Bethel. If so, you have an excellent goal. It is a very fine place to serve God in the final period of this wicked system of things. (2 Pet. 3:11, 12) Imagine, having theocratic companionship all day, being able to associate with many of Jehovah’s anointed ones, doing hard work to benefit “the entire association of your brothers in the world.” (1 Pet. 5:9) These are just some of the blessings you can receive. But it will mean progressing to that point, just as this brother did.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> This same thing was true with a schoolgirl in Berlin. While still in school she had a desire to enjoy the marvelous privilege of attending Gilead and serving as a missionary in some distant country. But what steps could she take to realize that goal? After graduating she became a regular pioneer, since she knew that one of the entrance requirements for Gilead school was two years in the pioneer ministry. While she was thus pioneering in Berlin she attended a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> study conducted in English. She would need to know that language to be accepted as a Gilead student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> Then, with her parents’ approval, she arranged for part-time employment in England, where the need was greater than in Berlin and where she could improve her English while pioneering. After being a regular pioneer in England for two years she accepted the opportunity to be a special pioneer, all the while keeping the goal of Gilead in mind. Was all this effort worth it? Unquestionably, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">yes!</span><span class="font0"> Being determined to work toward her goal, she had kept busy in the full-time service, enjoyed the blessing of encouraging eight other sisters to pioneer and today is a very happy student in the present class of Gilead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Those who traveled through Central and South America to the assemblies this past winter can especially appreciate this sister’s feelings. They were able to talk to brothers and sisters who have been enjoying the missionary service for years. They could sense that the missionaries have a deep feeling of security. Their food and a comfortable home are provided by the Society, enabling them to devote themselves to aiding those hungering for the truth. A sixty-five-year-old special pioneer who took the tour said: “When I heard the glowing reports from the faithful missionaries, I had the impulse to ask for a change of assignment.” Age not allowing this, she promised: “I will do my utmost to encourage the younger ones to seize the golden opportunity of reaching out for the foreign missionary field.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> What goals have you set? Probably you want to continue to make progress in learning the deep things of God’s Word and in becoming more skilled and effective in the field ministry. Fine! Work toward such by continuing to apply yourself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> But how about being a vacation pioneer, regular pioneer, special pioneer, circuit servant, member of the Bethel family, missionary or accepting some other privilege of service in Jehovah’s organization? Why not begin to plan now and speak to others about what you have in mind? Talk it over with the overseer, pioneers you know or the circuit servant when he visits. At large assemblies this summer make it a point to attend the meetings for persons interested in Bethel or missionary service. Eternal blessings await you as you set theocratic goals for yourself and continue to make progress.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Don't Miss Any Part of the Assembly Program!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">'As we get closer to the end of this old system of things Jehovah is helping us to see the truth and our responsibilities ever clearer. The pressures from the old system of things are increasing. To cope with these and continue In faithful service to Jehovah, we need to have the counsel he gives us through his Word and organization fresh and clear in our minds. For these reasons alone we should plan to be in attendance at every session of the “Disciple-making” District Assemblies this summer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When you arrive at the assembly and get your copy of the program, plan your affairs so you can be in your seat to listen to every part of the program. There were publishers last summer who missed out on some of the high points of the assembly and valuable, pointed instruction because they were not on hand during the program. None of us want to run the risk of suffering this disappointment and loss this year. Have you in the past missed out on the afternoon programs for personal reasons, attending only in the evening? Or have you missed some of the opening days, attending only on the weekend? Don’t make this your custom. (Heb. 10:25) Don’t miss any part of the assembly program!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As you plan to attend and begin to pack, there are many things to remember, aren’t there? Here is a list to help you:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">• The convention office needs to receive your Room Request form four to six weeks before the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• Another thing that can contribute much to your happiness is knowing that you helped to make the assembly a success by assisting in one of the assembly departments. Your overseer has applications for volunteer service. Ask him for one. Fill it out and return it to him for forwarding to the assembly city where you will attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• At the assembly, do you make it a practice to get acquainted with those who sit near you and those who are dose to you in the cafeteria? Your taking the initiative in this and sharing experiences can be very rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Another important thing for all of us to remember: We show respect for Jehovah and his organization if we are not walking in the hallway but are sharing in the closing prayer each day at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* We pray that all of you may enjoy much happiness and rich blessings from Jehovah as you attend every session of the district assembly this summer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Most of Jehovah’s people are very busy in the field ministry to Jehovah’s praise. A few of our brothers, however, have slowed down in their activity. Why? There are no doubt a variety of reasons. It may be a lack of spirituality on the part of the publisher. Or a good service schedule or service habits may be lacking. Some of our brothers have grown tired, however, of calling again and again at homes where people showed little or no interest So it is most appropriate to ask the questions: Why should we keep knocking on those doors? Why should we go often or spend much time in the ministry? Yes, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">WHY?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Well, how many reasons can you list? Try it.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">(a) I made a dedication to Jehovah and I plan to keep it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(b) I want to. I love Jehovah and know that my ministry is an evidence of my love and honors him.—1 John 5:3; Matt. 22:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font11"> People are still learning the truth, and I can show neighbor love by trying to find and feed Sheeplike ones in my territory. —Matt. 22 : 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(d) For my own good. So I will not get rusty in knowledge or use of the sword of the spirit. It is a safeguard for me.—1 Tim. 4: 16; Matt. 10:32, 33; Prov. 19:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(e) People change their minds. A person who told me &quot;No” last time may say “Yes” this time. —Acts 9:10, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(f) The Scriptures urge us to keep busy in the work of Jehovah. There is plenty to do and the workers are few.—1 Cor. 15: 58; Matt. 24:14; 9:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">(g) We are sharing in a dividing work. Just as with Isaiah, we don’t expect all to listen.—Isa. 6:9, 10; Matt. 25:32, 46.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Can you list more reasons for keeping busy in Jehovah’s service? And what about our brothers who have slowed down? What can you do to help them? Do you believe that sharing some of the above points or others with them would help? Try it. When Armageddon strikes, what will we be doing? The work of the Lord or something else? No, during this time of the end Is not the time to slow down. —1 Thess. 5:1-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> So, why do we keep busy, regularly spending many hours in our ministry? We have many reasons, don’t we?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">May should notify the Society without delay. Those who will vacation pioneer during the summer axe encouraged to apply a month before they start, if possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With “Awoke!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When you get your copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine from the magazine-territory servant, you no doubt scan the titles of the articles again and ask yourself: “Which of these articles would appeal to people in our territory?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers, however, have enjoyed outstahding success in using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine after asking themselves: “What is there in this issue that would appeal to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">certain people</span><span class="font11"> in our territory?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> For instance, there was the article on chiropractic. Some of our brothers took this issue of the magazine to local chiropractors. In some cases the publishers offered the subscription while they were at it. A number of publishers not only enjoyed the pleasure of obtaining subscriptions, but tilled requests for hundreds of additional copies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> This is the way so many of our brothers described their memorable activity in unassigned territory last summer and in years before, and they meant it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How do we know ? Well, in the United States right now we have 634 counties that are totally or partially unassigned. Four hundred and ninety-nine of these were worked in last summer. Three hundred and four of the groups who shared in unassigned-territory work last summer requested that they be given permission to go back into the same territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What about the remaining 330 unassigned territories? Most of these counties are scattered through the southern, central arid midwestern parts of the country in 37 states. Many of them have not been worked for two or three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Are you planning to take a vacation trip this summer? Would you like at the same time to have some share in talking the truth to interested people in these unassigned territories? Many family</span></p>

Had you considered taking the magazines to these? In the April 8 issue was the article entitled &quot;When They Get the Keys to a Car.” You may have found that parent groups in your community, auto clubs, driver’s schools and safety organizations wanted extra copies of this fine article. Many of you have also shared in distributing the special issue on “Evolution or Creation by God—Which?” to educators.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A number of publishers have received letters of appreciation from police officials to whom they sent articles on police work and crime.

<p><span class="font11">groups have enjoyed this pleasure in recent years. You may write the Society telling of your plans and desires in this regard. The Society will be glad to furnish information concerning unassigned territory that is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In addition to some special pioneers' being assigned to work unassigned territory that congregations cannot cover, we are herewith inviting regular pioneers to serve in the same capacity as special pioneers for this special work if: (1) two or more wish to work an assignment and have a serviceable car, (2) they are free to spend at least two or three months in unassigned territory work, and (3) health will permit spending 150 hours or more in field work each of the months. Ones who can do so will be given the same financial assistance that special pioneers receive during the months they work unassigned territory. Would you like to share? If so, please write at once for further information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• What arrangements can be made for handling funerals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It is good if arrangements can be made for a qualified brother or brothers in each congregation to prepare for handling a funeral if the congregation Is called upon for such assistance. The congregation committee should consider the Society's direction In &quot;Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,&quot; paragraph 41, as to who might qualify to be used in behalf of the congregation in such a capacity. Thus the congregation would be ready to render such services if it is called upon. Of course, arrangements for a funeral are arrangements that would normally be made by the family or relatives. If the family wishes a certain brother to handle the services and he Is able to comply with their request, then this is up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Society has provided a suggested outline for funeral services, which should be on hand in the congregation file. Congregations not having a copy may request it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Here at headquarters we have been enjoying many blessings by having with us the Kingdom Ministry School students from all parts of the country. We hear many enriching and inspiring experiences from these students. There is one that we would especially like to share with you. One of the students was at one time a commander in the American Legion and he related this experience to us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Back in 1950 the local post he commanded needed funds, and the Legion Hall was rented to Jehovah’s witnesses. Soon thereafter, one of his officers charged that the Witnesses took down the flag. To find out for himself, he sat in on one of their meetings. The flag was still there, and he liked what he heard. He asked many questions, and a Bible study was started with him. As he progressed in knowledge, the Bible’s teaching of true Christian love that reaches over all national barriers won out. He resigned from membership in the Legion at an open assembly, explaining his position and then walking out. His wife fanatically opposed his resignation, hurled shameful epithets at him and left him, taking along his two daughters and all his possessions. The local Witnesses rallied to his assistance. Now, after many years, he is conducting a study with his older daughter, now grown up and married and away from her mother’s influence. He rejoices to be serving under God’s appointed Commander, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have also heard some encouraging experiences from the Gilead students, the 45th class of Gilead having opened on October 23. You may be Interested to know that this class is made up of 101 students, 46 brothers and 55 sisters. They come from 11 different lands and average 25.8 years of age and 8.9 years in the truth. About half the class is studying Spanish and the others are studying French. On registration day Brother Knorr gave them a most helpful three-and-a-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Help Wanted</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>“For what?” you may ask. To do the Kingdom preaching work. The remaining time is short, and, as Jesus put it, “the good news has to be preached first,” before the old system comes to its end. (Mark 13:10) True, there are more than 300,000 helpers in the field in this country, but we know you will agree that more are needed to get the job done thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> December is one of those months when w<sup>r</sup>e give special attention to inviting other people to have an active share with us in praising Jehovah. These come basically from those with whom we study. At our service meetings recently we have been learning of things we might say to our Bible students to direct their attention to Jehovah's organization. Have you applied these suggestions at your studies? Are those with whom you study ready for service? If so, by all means invite them to share in the ministry this month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If someone is ready for service, you can put his mind at ease by describing the help that will be given him, so he won’t think he will be on his own. You could sit down with the new ones and work half-hour talk, to get them started in the right way. Incidentally, we also heard that Brother Knorr is planning to visit a few of the branches in the Caribbean area and Central America late in November.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">There is certainly a lot of work to be done around here, and, of course, there is much work for all of us to do in distribution of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> during December and in aiding others who want to share with us in libertygiving worship. We send all you dear brothers our warm love and greetings and pray Jehovah’s blessing upon you and your ministry to Him through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">out a simple sermon they could give and then invite them to go along with you and use it in the field. The Bible is what they have been studying, and it is the very book that we are offering this month, so they should be delighted to place the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> with others and encourage them to study it. Their spontaneous, genuine expressions of appreciation for how it has helped them will do much to encourage others to obtain it. Of course, you may want to take new ones along with you in the magazine activity or on one of your back-calls or studies. Wherever you start them in the service, help them to see what a joyful work it is and how vital that they continue in it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There will undoubtedly be some who need special assistance. Would it help you young publishers to have a simple sermon you could use? If so, why not ask your parents to work one out with you and then practice it at home? New publishers will appreciate like assistance. Some, too, are elderly or confined to their homes and could use help either with transportation or in writing letters. Why not find out if some of the elderly or infirm are doing incidental witnessing that they may not be reporting? In one experience we heard at Bethel, an elderly sister who was reporting very little service was actually writing letters and talking the truth some thirty hours each month to children and other non-dedicated persons. Now this time is being reported, and she is happy about it. We know that you publishers want to assist such ones, even though it means going out of your way, so be sure to keep your eyes open to see opportunities to aid all who are not strong.—Rom. 15:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Are we not glad that we heard the “help wanted” call and responded? Indeed we are! Let us joyfully aid others to know that their help is wanted in publishing the “good news.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Theme: Expanding Our Praise to Jehovah. Song 61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">College students, assigned to do research on Witnesses, visit publishers to get information about organization and how it functions. This is not first discussion; what was mere curiosity at first has turned into genuine interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Base discussion on pages 152 through 170 in book, but in answering questions direct attention to the Bible, reading some texts, quoting others. Make the thoughts in tnird and fourth sentences at top of page 168 permeate discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Help Wanted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Questions and answers; possibly a demonstration of assistance being given to an irregular publisher to share In the service, or by parents to help children in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are those with whom you conduct a home Bible study attending congregation meetings yet? If not, keep on inviting them. But, whether they have responded yet or not, we suggest that you apply the following suggestion within the next week or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstrate: Same householders as previously, same publisher conducting study. As study concludes, publisher says: “You have observed the way that Jehovah's witnesses carry on their preaching work, so I thought you would be interested in the Scriptural basis for it. Would you open your Bibles to Acts 20:20?’’ Show that apostles called from house to house: so do we. Turn to Psalm 148:12, 13 —all In congregation have a share. Next, Luke 8:1—training is provided until one gains experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Unless those with whom you study are really ready for It, not necessary to invite them in service at this point. This is just one step in preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">2 min: Accounts servant’s report. 10 min: Concluding comments. Highlight suggestions on opportunities to place “New World Translation.” Appropriate Announcements. Song 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Question Box. Book study servant discusses with his group, including children, how they can all make back-calls and should report those they make, including deliveries on magazine routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Presenting the Good News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discussion with audience: include demonstration of placing Bible when person says he has one, also how to start a study whether the Bible is placed or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 mln: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discourse on the subject “Keeping the Congregation Clean,” pages 170 through 186 in book. To be handled preferably by one of the committee. Cover briefly the main points of the entire chapter so everyone gets overall picture, but concentrate on any aspect most needed in your congregation. Use scriptures, particularly on points that you emphasize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. May wish to discuss what to say during holiday season, perhaps offering suggestions for magazine presentations. See also “Make Sure,’’ pages 236-238. Have all reported field service by 15th of month? Remind brothers to study material in “Lamp” book, pages 186 through 198, for next week. Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Accepting and Appreciating Our Privileges of Service. Song 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God. (Urgency of preaching.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On your home Bible studies this past week or two. did you discuss the Scriptural basis for preaching work? Ready for next step; let’s look in at conclusion of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstrate: Publisher says: “Before we conclude our discussion, there are two scriptures that I would like to share with you. They show why Jehovah’s witnesses feel such urgency about the preaching work that they do.’’ 2 Timothy 4:1, 2—“be at It urgently.” Matthew 24:14—end of wicked system close at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whether your study Is new or one of longer duration, we suggest you discuss these points with the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pages 186 through 198 to be covered by audience participation, questions and answers. Encourage spontaneous answers, rather than searching for answers from book. Brother in charge should know material well to be sure points are covered. Use questions below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Opportunities to Share in Special Privileges of Service”: How does a mature Christian feel about taking on added responsibilities in Jehovah’s service? What do the Scriptures say about the need for personal progress? What is required on our part If we are to show an increase as a result of our work? Name a factor that is basic to any real progress, and explain what should be done about it. If some are not regularly and effectively sharing in the back-call and Bible study work, what is recommended, and why? To what privilege does Romans 15:1, 2 direct our attention, and how can It be handled in practical ways? How can a person become qualified to be an appointed servant? (Serving Where the Need Is Greater) What is meant by territory 'where the need is greater’? What viewpoint does the Bible encourage us to nave toward such territory? In what way can this territory be cared for? (Regular Pioneer Service) How much of one’s time Is required to be a pioneer? How should young people who are finishing school view pioneer service? (Read and emphasize p. 194, pars. 2, 3.) Who may be a pioneer, and how does one apply for this service? What responsibilities does one emblllng as a pioneer accept? Besides his field ministry, what other responsibilities does a pioneer have? What place does secular work have In his life? How long are pioneers encouraged to stay on in that service, If possible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Branch letter. Family discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Organized to Help.” Talk by mature brother warmly expressing appreciation for the fine help rendered by the congregation book study servants and others who are working so diligently to assist their brothers. Also include in talk some questions for audience to answer.</span></p>

Song 112.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This meeting may be planned locally. However, you may wish to switch the sermon for the “Watchtower” campaign to this meeting if the service meeting falls on December 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Made Powerful Spiritually, Though Weak Physically. Song 21. 10 min: Introduction, text and comments, along with talk on theme for the month taken from article in January 1, 1968, “Watchtower.” 20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pages 199 through 207, to be covered with audience participation. Brother assigned this part should know material well to assure good coverage. Use questions below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(Vacation Pioneer Service) Who are the ones that enroll as vacation pioneers, and when may a person share in this service? (Also, ask how many locally have been vacation pioneers at some time.) What are the preenrollment requirements? What are the service goals for vacation pioneers? How do those who have been vacation pioneers feel about this service? (Special Pioneer Service) What is special pioneer service? How do special pioneers go about organizing new congregations? So, what qualifications are needed by special pioneers? Outline their service goals and the provisions made to help them both materially and spiritually. What Bible record is a special source of Inspiration to those reaching out for special pioneer service? (Missionary Service) Was missionary service a part of first-century Christianity, and why? What moves a person to become a missionary? How long have some missionaries been in their assignments, and how do they feel about their work? What special training is given to prospective missionaries, and who qualify for it? How do missionaries obtain the material necessities of life? What desire and what experiences can soon cause one to forget any strangeness about the way of life In his missionary territory? (Read p. 205, par. 1.) (Bethel Service) Why does the Society operate Bethel homes, branch offices and printing plants, and what kind of work is done there? Is there any similarity between such work and that work done by the early Christians? Outline the Bethel family schedule. Who may qualify for Bethel service?

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Organized to Help</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Isn’t it pleasant to have a real friend, one that you know is truly concerned with your welfare and is interested in you and your problems? That is what the book study servant endeavors to be. He sees the importance of showing a warm personal interest in the spiritual well-being of each one in his study group. Though he has personal matters to care for, perhaps a family, yet he endeavors to organize his life in order to be of help to us; and we appreciate all the services he renders to us, don’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Just think about what he does for us. Each week he conducts a fine Bible study for our spiritual upbuilding, helping us to get a clearer understanding of points that we may have found difficult. Also, he makes arrangements for field service to fit our circumstances. He regularly obtains territory in which we can work. When we need to go along with someone else in the service, either for training or encouragement, he is glad to arrange for it. He even makes it a point to go with us himself from time to time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If we have been missing the meetings for some reason, he may stop by our home to see us, or perhaps give us a call on the phone. He knows that we need the meetings in order to stay spiritually alive. He realizes that there may be problems that are keeping us away from Jehovah’s table. He is interested</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Service Meetings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Suggested sermon for &quot;Watchtower&quot; campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Finding Security by Turning to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Isa. 59:7, 8—World lacks security because of forsaking God</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prov. 1:33—Ones who listen to wisdom of God enjoy security</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ask for suggestions on Introducing sermon to fit local circumstances and on transitions between the scriptures and to the otter. Basically we might ask: &quot;Security is important to everyone, isn’t that true? We would appreciate being free from fear, danger and anxiety about the future. Yet there is great insecurity, and most people are affected by it. The Bible shows clearly why this insecurity exists. Note these words at Isaiah 59:7 and 8 . . . ’* Then as a transition to Proverbs 1:33, “It is apparent that the wisdom of man has not produced security, but note the assurance in Proverbs 1:33 ...” In conclusion you might say, &quot;The ’Watchtower’ magazine offers a guide to the Bible’s thoughts on security and the real hope for mankind. [Show magazine and refer to specific article.] You may have it for a year for just one dollar. Three booklets are given as a gift with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If time allows, sermon may be demonstrated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: “What the People Need.&quot; Enthusiastic talk arousing interest for the “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. Song 105. </span><span class="font11">in us, so, without prying into our private affairs, he simply asks if he can be of help. Or perhaps we have not turned In a service report for the month, so he checks with us about it. Why does he do it? Because he cares for us. He believes that, as Jehovah’s servants, we really want to share in the preaching work; so he offers to be of assistance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps there have been occasions when you had an assignment to give a student talk and you asked your book study servant for assistance. After you spent a little time discussing it together, the whole job seemed easier, didn’t it? How glad you were to have a brother like that who was willing to help! Or, it may be that you put forth a special effort to comment at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, and afterward your book study servant let you know how good it was to hear your expression. It warmed your heart,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What the People Need</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do the people In your territory realize that the end of the old system of things is close at hand? Do they know that their choice of religion, and what they do about it, will determine whether they will be among the survivors? Do they really know the difference between their own religion and what the Bible teaches? These are things that they need to know, aren’t they? These are points that we want to impress on their minds, and you will be glad to know that these are the truths that will be emphasized in the straightforward articles in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> during the forthcoming </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign. This is what the people need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How can we help them to benefit from it? By getting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">magazine into their hands. During the coming months each issue will begin with an article on a topic that you will find most people willing to talk about, something that they want to know about. For example: “Where Can You Find Security?” and “Security That Even Money Cannot Buy.” These subjects will lead into the plainspoken discussions of truth mentioned above. This is something that we can offer enthusiastically. How beneficial it will be to have Information of this sort going into the homes of subscribers twice a month! That is what we want to arrange. There are many opportunities to obtain subscriptions, but, among others, be sure to give the house-to-house work a prominent place in your service program. It is here that most subscriptions are obtained.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">didn’t it? It made you thank God for his provision of brothers who do so much to build us up.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Yes, the book study servants are brothers whose love for Jehovah and his people moves them to give freely of their time to help us. How much we appreciate them! We can truly say of them as Paul said of Epaphroditus, “keep holding men of that sort dear.”—Phil. 2: 29.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the “New World Translation”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The very fact that the Bible has long been the best selling book alerts us to the fact that many people already have a copy in their homes. So, as we present the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> at the homes in December, we will not be surprised when many say, “Oh, I have a Bible.” But very likely what they have Is a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version,</span><span class="font11"> which was originally published away back in 1610 C.E., or a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King Jam es Version, </span><span class="font11">which was first published In 1611 C.E. If that is the case, they may readily agree that there is much in the Bible that is difficult to understand or they may have noted the archaic language that is used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It may be of interest to them, then, to realize that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> is not just another Bible, but a modern version prepared with a view both to accurate translation of the original thought of the Hebrew and Greek text and to use of modern understandable language. It is now available in complete form in English and Spanish, with the Christian Greek Scriptures also available in French, Portuguese, German, Dutch and Italian. Some interesting comparisons of scripture renderings are found in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> pages 52 and 53, which might well be used to show the advantage of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> in obtaining a clear appreciation of the meaning of the Scriptures. Sometimes just letting the householder read a few verses from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> is enough to help him appreciate how understandable it is and the advantage It has over older translations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> But do not forget the other fine features of this Bible. The concordance, or Index of Important Bible Words, is a wonderful aid to any sincere person who wants to study the Scriptures. The appendix has some very interesting doctrinal information on subjects such as Hades and the soul, also on the use of Jehovah’s name in the Greek Scriptures. Then we have some interesting maps of Bible lands and the Table of the Books of the Bible, listing the writer, date and place of writing and time covered for each of the 66 Bible books. AH this for only $1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But still some people prefer to stick to the Bible they are accustomed to and do not want a “new Bible,” as they view it. What then? While they may not be interested in another Bible, they might very much appreciate having a home Bible study. Here is where we can use the direct approach to good advantage, explaining that as Bible teachers our work is to arrange for free home Bible studies, using the Bible of their choice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Our work is to see that this book that has long been a best seller becomes the best read and understood book among people of all nations who love Jehovah. Let us work with that goal in view during December.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">Public Meetings Held: 22,922 UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1968 342,516 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Look at the excellent growth and activity reflected in the above reports. We held up printing the September report until we were sure it was correct, as some congregations misunderstood how to send in their report; so this allows for some comparison. Note those increasing publisher figures. They represent an average of 11,958 more workers in the field for September and October than for the same months last year. The regular pioneer ranks continued to swell, with a peak of 10,687 in October. In every feature of service for special, regular and vacation pioneers, as well as congregation publishers, October was better than September. Likely the crowning feature of increased activity in October was in back-calls, for you made 2,127,666, or a quarter of a million more than our previous peak in April 1965. We are delighted with this start for the service year and look for further fine progress as we continue to show appreciation for the urgency of the message we bear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">♦ Malawi had a fine new peak of 18,-549 publishers in September. On October 23d a ban was announced against Jehovah’s witnesses because they were ‘'dangerous to the good government of the State.” Appeals have been taken, as the reasons given for the ban were based on false charges. During September, prior to the ban, in one small area 15 homes of brothers were pulled down and the brothers assaulted. The missionaries have now been ordered out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ Italy reports a new peak of publishers for September of 11,402. This is 1,375 more than last September. Publishers continue to average 10 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ South Africa reports that so far far eight assemblies the public meeting attendance has been 16,253, with 296 baptized.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question. ($ox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">• Is it true that back-calls may be reported even when deliveries are made on a magazine route and when a phone call is made to invite a newly interested person to a meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, that is true. The important thing is to keep in regular touch with these people to further their interest in Goa’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First of all, keep in mind that a back-call almost always involves a return visit to an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">unbaptized</span><span class="font10"> person who </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">previously showed interest,</span><span class="font10"> and to count the call you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">must contact that person.</span><span class="font10"> Also, the visit should be made with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">intention of making a back-call.</span><span class="font10"> What you are able to do on the call may depend to a large extent on the householder, but good is accomplished even by making contact again, and the call may be counted if it conforms to the points italicized above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes you may stop by to have a Bible discussion with one of these persons, perhaps to conduct a home Bible study. At other times you may simply drop off a piece of literature for him to read, or invite him to a meeting. Usually your return visit will be made in person, either by going to his house or by having him come to yours. But at times the return visit may, of necessity, be by writing a letter in which you give a further witness, or it may be made over the phone. It may simply be a phone call to invite him to a meeting, or to tell him about a congregation meeting that you attended. You may also stop at his home to take him with you to a meeting. Each time you do any of these things, and succeed in contacting the intended person, you have made a back-call. Be sure to Include it in your report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is more, but we will save it for next month.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">We always look forward to springtime to put forth an extraordinary effort in our ministry. And you brothers certainly put forth that extra effort in April, reaching a new peak of 328,648 preachers of the good news. That passes our former peak—327,588 publishers in 1965—by 1,060. Marvelous! Everything about the report is exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are increases in publishers, new subscriptions and Bible studies. During April you obtained 208.300 new subscriptions, and that is about 60,000 more than in April of 1966 and 24,500 more than in April of 1965. During the entire four-month </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign you obtained 639,863 new subscriptions, to compare with 487,136 for the campaign in 1966. What work all of you did to accomplish that!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstanding was your home Bible study activity. You certainly did spend time teaching. You reported 276.881 home Bible studies in April, which is up considerably from the 258,569 of last year and from the 256,059 of the year before that. My, what a fine increase in the work of teaching the Bible to interested persons right In their own homes'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While all this was happening in April you also placed 7,660,862 individual copies of the magazines, 101,400 bound books and 462,123 booklets. As you well know, the theme for April was “By teaching, make disciples of Christ,” and the literature you have placed and the subscriptions obtained will help to forward that teaching work. But you will be calling back on these persons to help them further, won't you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quite a few congregations in the United States had a 20-percent increase in publishers in April. A larger number reached an increase of 10 percent. The country as a whole enjoyed a 7.6-percent increase over last year’s average of 305,481 publishers. How did your congregation do? Also, the number of vacation pioneers included among the Kingdom ministers during April numbered 20,529, to compare with</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Paying What You Owe?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Have you taken a close look at the service theme for this month of June—“Paying fully what we owe God”? That surely reminds us that we are under an obligation, a debt that w’e are striving to discharge faithfully. Isn’t it wonderful, though, that Jehovah is not a hard creditor, that he views considerately our earnest efforts to pay our debt to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- However, we need to be careful that we do not misconstrue his kindness and so become careless, don’t we? People in the world often act as if they thought that others owed them a living. But as Christians we know that we are the ones who are in debt for the favor of life, and the one to whom we are in debt is God. The only way we can pay our debt is by giving him our exclusive devotion. That means that the kind of devotion we give to God is something we do not share with anyone else. We do not let others take first place and cause us to push aside our responsibilities to God. To pay such a debt, it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">18,646 last year. Grand! We are very happy that so many of you could arrange your affairs to vacation pioneer during April. Undoubtedly you vacation pioneers arranged for many more Bible studies, and you will enjoy caring for them in the months to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though April is past, we do have a responsibility toward those new ones who started preaching then. We want to help them to share regularly in the field service each month. What are you going to do to encourage them? How many newly interested ones and new publishers can we bring to the “Disciplemaking” district assemblies this summer? Have you thought about that? Have you talked to them about the assemblies? If not, why not do so? Let them enjoy the feast too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You also want to know what the attendance was at the special public talk and the Memorial, don’t you? Well, the talk on the “Millennium” obvious that more than occasional meeting attendance and a service report once a month is required; we must put Jehovah and our service to him in first place all the time. What rewards are ours when we do that!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Appreciation of the need, not only to pay our debt to God, but to do so fully, will also cause us to keep an eye on the quality of our sacrifice of praise. That is something that we need to do no matter how long we have been in the way of the truth. Don’t you agree that careful preparation is a big factor in good presentations? We all know that when we prepare our sermons well we put across the points more clearly. Likewise, when we prepare to handle objections we are able to give a good witness to more householders. It is wise to set aside a few minutes for such preparation before going out in service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> During June the offer of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> is a splen-</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font7"> 4, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">went over very well, and 386,560 were present, or 24,297 more than last year. As for Memorial attendance, it was remarkable. In the United States we had 600,756 on hand, and 4,915 partook of the emblems, indicating that they are of the remnant. That is an increase of 42,262 in attendance, and a decrease of 101 partakers. So a few more of the remnant have finished their earthly course, but those remaining, along with the &quot;great crowd,” want to press on diligently in praising Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having had such a fine time in April, let’s continue to &quot;pay fully what we owe God” during the remaining months of the service year. What a joy and privilege it is to share in this, the most important work being done on earth! May Jehovah’s blessing go with you. We send to one and all our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Distributing the Life-sustaining Word of God. (Matt. 4:4) Song 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At evening meal family informally reviews points from day’s text discussed earlier in the day and at conclusion of meal father has someone read experiences from &quot;Yearbook,” p. 202, pars. 2, 3. Each day family progressively reads “Yearbook” experiences in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Superiority of “New World Translation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Preparation is essential to an effective ministry. Encourage audience to make notes of comparisons with the “King James” and “Douay” versions. In this way we will be equipped to show the superiority of the “New World Translation” at any time. Have someone read the following references from appropriate translations, with audience making the comparisons as noted below, highlighting the words or phrases difficult to understand. Stress carefully making notes now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following scriptures are rendered similarly in both “King James” and “Douay” versions (“New World Translation” rendering shown first): Matt. 5:3, “conscious of their spiritual need”—“poor in spirit”; Rom. 8:8, “in harmony with the flesh”—“in the flesh”; 1 Cor. 10:25, “meat market” —“shambles”; Phil. 1:8, “in such tender affection”—“in the bowels of”; Phil. 3:20, “citizenship”—“conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition the following may be used when householder has the “King James” version: Gen. 25:29, “boiling up some stew”—“sod pottage”; Lev. 26:16, “tuberculosis and burning fever” —“consumption, and the burning ague”; Prov. 29:24, “reports”—“be-wrayeth”; Jer. 4:22, “unwise”—“sottish”; Philem. 8, “what Is proper&quot; —“that which Is convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following are comparisons with the “Douay” version: Isa. 14:23, “porcupines,” “broom of annihilation”— “ericius,” “besom”; 1 John 2:16, “desire”—“concupiscence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By calling attention to such comparisons we can quickly show the value and superiority of the “New World Translation.” Some comparisons are shown on page 52 of “Make Sure of All Things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">13 min: Presenting the Good News. Audience discussion and demonstration. Discuss advantage of using householder’s Bible; he may feel that our Bible is different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">8 min: Branch letter. Get suggestions from audience on effectively following up interest found during “Watchtower” campaign and during May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">12 min: Concluding comments. Discuss congregation report for May. Include Theocratic News and appropriate items from Announcements. Ask audience what common objections they meet when offering the Bible; these will be considered on next week’s service meeting. Song 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Help People to Benefit from God’s Word. Song 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text, comments,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: “Do You Give ‘Just as You Have Resolved in Your Heart’?’’ Talk and discussion by overseer or other mature brother on material in'May 15, 1967, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: &quot;Evening Witnessing.” Handled by questions and answers. Include any good experiences had in this work locally. Overseer might make tentative arrangements during meeting for evening witnessing if congregation is not already sharing in such activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">20 min: Helping People to See the Value of the “New World Translation.” W<sup>r</sup>e are not Bible salesmen but ministers. We encourage people to read any Bible translation, and we will gladly study it with them. But most people do not read the Bible. The clergy have downgraded it and the archaic language discourages many. We know’ that, even if they have a Bible in the home, the &quot;New World Translation” can help them to become readers of the Bible and it can assist them to understand what they read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before this meeting make a list of objections raised by householders in your territory when the Bible Is offered, such as “I already have a Bible.&quot; “I don’t have time,” “I’m not interested,” etc. Work out effective answers, not downgrading the Bible they have, but helping them to see how the “New World Translation” will aid them to enjoy reading the Bible and understand it more clearly. Bring up the objections, one at a time. Discuss them with the audience, welcoming suggestions on how to overcome these objections. Then have prepared publishers demonstrate how situations might be handled in each case. Encourage publishers to make notes of ideas that they feel they can use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments. Include local experiences in starting Bible studies in various ways. Song 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Be Thorough in Your Ministry. Song 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. Points from daily text can be reviewed by car group on way to territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">20 min: “Are You Paying What You Owe?” Audience discussion and demonstration of appropriate points in main article. Include local experiences in placing Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Question Box. Discuss material as it applies to congregation. Comment on reason for meetings for service, benefits, etc. Fit service arrangements to circumstances locally. Some groups may have meetings for service at some place other than the book study location to cut down on travel time, etc,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Giving a Thorough Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Magazine-territory servant discusses with congregation the coverage of territory. Are all territories being worked? Invite publishers to work in sections that need attention. Make list of these territories available to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cover territory thoroughly. At what percent of homes do you find people at home? Make note of others; call again. Infirm publishers can help to work not-at-homes by writing letters to them, enclosing a tract or a magazine. Others may want to do this too if some are consistently not at home. Keep in mind, too, that by working territory at different times and on different days of the week you may meet other members of the household. All need to hear the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any working isolated territory, or other territory not often covered, may want to offer subscriptions so that people will be regularly receiving something to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments. Have expressions from publishers on how they will have a full share in service during the summer months as vacation pioneers, or by putting in more time as publishers. Draw comments from audience on our motive for increased praise: to honor Jehovah, to help people, etc. Song 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This meeting can be worked up according to the needs of the congregation. (Some time might be spent reviewing experiences in offering Bible during June and results in starting studies. Might take time to review points learned at various meetings that were appreciated. Could discuss plans to attend assemblies and have a full share in summer witnessing. Time might be spent showing how study can be started on the initial call using scriptures in suggested sermon or one appropriate to territory.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Hold to the Custom of Not Neglecting God’s House. Song 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on month’s theme, “Hold to the Custom of Not Neglecting God’s House.” See “Watchtower” of July 1, 1967, and January 1, 1966. 10 min: “Yearbook” experiences on meeting attendance (p. 89, pars. 1-6; p. 130, par. 2; p. 141, par. 2; p. 188, par. 1; p. 265, par, I).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">13 min: Overcoming Obstacles to Meeting Attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Determine what the problems are locally and use these as the basis for this part. Cover material in discussion between two brothers, along with some short demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Suggestions: (1) Need to build up enthusiasm among newly interested ones. Regularly discuss meetings with them. Demonstrate how; make clear that householder will not be called on to comment unless he volunteers. (2) Family going away for vacation. Plan ahead; write Society for address of Kingdom Hall and times of meetings in locality where they will be. (3) Relatives come to visit. Invite them to come to hall with you. If they do not want to do that, you may ask them to return at another time, or perhaps suggest that they make themselves at home until you return. (4) Need to plan personal affairs around meetings, which are of first importance in bur lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">12 min: Attending One of the District Assemblies. Consider material in article “Paying Attention.” Relate “Yearbook” experiences overcoming obstacles to attend (p. 210, par. 2; p. 225, par. 4; p. 239, par. 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments. Mention appropriate points to whet appetite for Sunday “Watchtower” study and to encourage advance preparation. Song 48.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Paying Attention</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup>A marvelous program has been prepared for the 1967 district assemblies. Will you be there? We hope so, and we know that, once you are at the assembly, you will want to get the full benefit from the program. The way to do it, we are sure you will agree, Is by paying attention.—Prov. 4: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> But sometimes that is difficult in a large crowd. Perhaps if we were to mention some of the things that make it difficult we could all put forth an effort to avoid them. For example, when people come in late or leave early, it distracts, doesn’t it? There are times when it cannot be avoided, but, usually, it is simply a matter of careful planning. Of course, those working In volunteer service sometimes need to leave a little early, and we understand that; the work they are doing is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Milling around in the hallways also distracts—especially does it distract those who sit toward the rear. But why would anyone want to travel to an assembly and then not listen to what is being said? For our part, let’s make it a point to be in our seats and listening during all the sessions. Then, too, there are those with cameras who may crowd around the railing down front to take pictures during parts of the program. It is distracting,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">+ Suggested points for discussion at meetings for service: Week of June 11: Scripture comparisons to show superiority of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font6"> (Refer to page 52 of “Make Sure.”) June 18: How studies can be started in Bible on initial call.

<p><span class="font6">—Portuguese, Spanish </span><span class="font7">isn’t it? And that should be enough to let us know that we would not want to do that ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Have you ever tried to listen to a talk when others near you were carrying on a conversation? It is most difficult. Of course, assemblies provide a fine opportunity to visit with friends, and we all look forward to seeing others. But the time to do it is between sessions, isn’t it? Frequently those who do quite a bit of visiting during sessions are observed to be teen-agers, and usually they are not with their parents. The solution is obvious. Do you have children who will be at an assembly with you this summer? It will be a kindness both to your children and to others present if you make definite plans to sit together as a family for each assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Of course, the matter of paying attention also calls for self-discipline on the part of each one of us. If we allow our eyes to wander, to read advertising signs, to watch passing airplanes, and so forth, we will not be benefiting from the program. But if we keep our eyes on the speaker, It is most likely that we will also hear what he is saying. And, brothers, at the assemblies this summer there are important things for all of us to hear. So, let’s make it our determination to pay attention.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Evening Witnessing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Have you found that during the summer months many persons are not at home on weekends, or if you do find them at home they are on their way out? That has frequently been our experience. We are living in restless times when people are on the move, with entertainment and relaxation playing important roles in their lives. (2 Tim. 3:4) As “lovers of God” we might well ask, How can we effectively minister to such persons during the summer* months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Evening witnessing may prove to be the answer. Many have tried it even during winter months with excellent results. One study conductor reported that instead of finding four out of five persons not at home, as was generally the case when calling on Sunday morning, he was able to find four out of five at home when calling between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. He found, too, that he was talking to many persons who previously never really had an opportunity to get acquainted with the Kingdom message. The publishers at his book-study location were particularly impressed by the ease with which they were able to talk to people and start studies in the Bible, using one of the variety of methods suggested in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font7"> Even when literature was not placed or people were not particularly interested in the Bible, it was found that they were generally more congenial and polite. As one sister put it: “It was almost like working a territory that had not been covered previously.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Really, why do we share in the field ministry? It is not simply to be able to report hours on a service report, is it? Our objective is to talk to people about God. So, if you find that you can accomplish more along these lines at certain times than at others, why not adjust your service schedule to make your work productive? You will enjoy the service more if you can. Of course, not all publishers are able to share in the service in the evening, and It is not wise in some areas to make calls after dark. But those who can adjust their schedule to accommodate it to the circumstances of the people in their territory do get better results.—1 Cor. 9:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> So if you are finding that many persons are not at home or are sleeping when you call, it may be that you could obtain good results from evening witnessing. Why not try it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Studies in the Bible</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> When starting Bible studies on the initial call, after our brief introductory remarks we may find it beneficial to encourage the householder to get his Bible. (At this point we may be invited in or we might make a polite request to step inside.) Our getting right into the Bible and focusing attention on the Bible will help the householder to appreciate that we are encouraging Bible study and not just study in a book or booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> We can mention that, to demonstrate the subject method of study, we have selected the topic “The True God.” (Information to use can be found on page 5 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good Ne icg&quot;</span><span class="font7"> booklet.) The basic points made are important for all persons to know. We could say: “Acts 4:24 tells us something about the true God, so let’s look that up.” If the householder needs help in looking up scriptures, it may be good to explain that Acts is a book of the Bible, what the numbers represent, how to use the listing of Bible books in the front of most Bibles, etc. If we show the householder how to find scriptures, then he will be able to do this on his own even after we leave. After discussing the first scripture make the point that we call God the Creator, etc. “The next text shows that everyone who wants life must recognize God's supremacy.” Refer the householder to 1 Corinthians 15:28 and encourage him to find it in his Bible. At this point we might show</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Paying What You Owe? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font7">did one to use as we discharge our obligations to God. People need the Bible, and they need it in a form that invites reading. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> can fill that need. But to convince the householders </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> that, we need to be able to handle their common objections and point to specific texts that will make apparent to them that this is a fine Bible to have. The service meetings during June will help you to be equipped to do that, but when you get out in the service will you remember the suggestions that were given? We believe that you will if you take a few minutes to prepare just before going into the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the householder the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Good News&quot; </span><span class="font7">booklet so he can see where we are getting the Scripture references and then get right back to the Bible and discuss 1 John 4:12. In this way the literature is gradually introduced but attention is still focused on the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> In conclusion a brief review will help the householder to appreciate what he has learned from the Bible by using the subject method of study. The review can be conducted by reading material from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Good News”</span><span class="font7"> booklet to show that it agrees with the points already established from the Bible. This will help to instill appreciation for the need of using a Bible study aid, such as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font7"> booklet. Our asking questions in the review that the householder will be able to answer readily will undoubtedly be an encouragement to him. The review provides an excellent opportunity to show the practical value of what has been learned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Discernment helps us to determine whether the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> or other literature should be offered on the initial call. If arrangements are made to continue the study, it may be good in some cases to wait until a return visit to offer literature. As we endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call and focus attention on the Bible, Jehovah’s blessing will attend our efforts to help sheeplike ones take in accurate knowledge.—John 17: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> As we make our calls it is always wise to take into consideration the circumstances of the householder. For example, sometimes when we call, no one answers the door. Perhaps they are not at home; maybe they are not feeling well, or they may not be interested. What should you do? If they are at home, excessive ringing of the bell usually will not make them more receptive. But a handbill, slipped under the door, may be read later with good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> By thus sharing in Jehovah’s service we are paying what we owe God. But we will never have that debt completely paid, and it is just as well, because our greatest happiness comes in doing his will.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ During April the Society arranged for 134,000 copies of the special &quot;Awakel&quot; of April 22 to be sent to doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, college professors, etc., in 15 of the largest cities in the U.S. Wrappers for mailing these were typed up from the Yellow Pages of phone directories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Chile reports subscriptions running 80 percent ahead of last year and a 13-percent increase in publishers during March, for a total of 4,221.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The response to vacation pioneer service </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for April was very</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> gratifying. Many congregations had several vacation pioneers, some ten, others twenty and one submitted thirty-five applications at one time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>v^uestion. (L5ox</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">• When congregations have morning meetings on Sunday, how may arrangements for service be handled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If most of the publishers will be going out in service directly after the &quot;Watchtower” study, the conductor can take a few minutes in concluding comments to discuss the field service activity for that afternoon. In such a case it is not necessary to discuss the daily text, since much fine Scriptural counsel and encouragement has already been given at the public talk and the &quot;Watchtower” study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the meeting is dismissed, many of the publishers may want to get into the service right away, and that is fine. If some want to bring a sandwich to eat before going to the territory, that may be done, and it may help to tide them over until they have their larger meal later in the day. If any of the publishers prefer to go home to eat before sharing in the service, then they may go directly to the territory when they are ready, or arrangements can be made for them to meet for service at some convenient locations, if that appears advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who cannot participate in the door-to-door service on a certain Sunday may want to make one or two back-calls on their way home from the meetings. Just a few extra minutes spent in this way can produce excellent results and be very upbuilding. Even if others of your family are not in the truth, they probably will not object to your being away this short additional time.</span></p>

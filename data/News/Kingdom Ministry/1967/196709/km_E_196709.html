<p><span class="font11">At the time this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> is going to press, the “Disciple-making” District Assemblies are still in operation, but so far at the 38 assemblies held there were 326,487 attending the public meeting. What a report, and seven more assemblies to hear from I It warms our hearts, too, to see that your discipllng work has been going on so well, because 4,758 have been immersed at the assemblies reported. We are sure that all who have had the privilege of attending one of these assemblies feel the importance of “disciple-making” work. There are no less than 250,000 people studying with us every week, and we should be making disciples out of these as the months go on. With this convention so fresh in our minds we ought to keep this big idea of &quot;disciple-making” foremost. The four extra pages in this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> will give us all the highlights of the assembly, and, of course, you will want to read that carefully; they are going to bring back very many pleasant memories as well as stimulate you in doing the discipling work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The other morning at breakfast, Thursday, July 20. Brother Knorr gave all the students now going through Gilead their foreign assignments. This was quite a surprise for them because he usually gives them out on a Monday night. What an exciting finish to our breakfast session 1 Now they know where they are going, and the Society is working on their passports and their visas, and is arranging for passage so that, as soon as graduation is over, the majority of them will be on their way to their foreign assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So you see the Society is very anxious to get the discipling work done or to advance it in all these other countries. Of course, the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot&quot;</span><span class="font11"> shows how important it is to make this discipling work more prominent, because those persons who are going to be baptized in the future are persons who will have</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Does it seem possible to you that another entire service year has passed and a new service year has already started? We have kept busy and can be thankful that Jehovah, on his part, has preserved the possession of peace for his people in a most unsettled, explosive world. This peace with Jehovah we must work to Increase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The best success in the coming service year will be achieved by analyzing what we have done and then planning and arranging to make improvements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Servants, all of you, should “know positively the appearance of your flock.” (Prov. 27:23) Certain features of service activity may need strengthening. Preparing and applying a definite plan for improving tlipse one at a time will be sure to bring results. Does the Kingdom Hall need some attention? Proper planning and organization of this work will contribute to progress, while getting the work done more peacefully and in a manner less costly in money, effort and time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">gone through a series of questions and really proved themselves to be disciples of Christ. By the way, here at Bethel at breakfasttime we have finished reading all the experiences in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> and now in its place and until the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1968 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> comes out we are reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span><span class="font11"> In that way we get all the questions reviewed and hear anew how the whole organization operates. It is interesting. Why don’t you try it when you finish your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> reading?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the August </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> we were telling you about the new Bethel building and the excitement in connection with it. Now the demolition has begun on the old building, which is known as the “Norwegian Club,” and there is quite a bit of talk around the Heights about its going down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hasn’t the year gone fast? The</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah has shown that expansion comes when the congregation itself is strong and peaceful internally. (Jas. 3:18) During the coming year let us emphasize the strengthening of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">internal organization</span><span class="font11"> as we reach out for new ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>B</sup> During the past service year many were helped to regain a good standing with Jehovah God. There are yet some who have lost this wonderful peace to a greater or lesser degree, and they need help to regain It. The servants can make a reasonable, workable plan for visiting these. In some congregations they have devoted a certain evening each week to this important service. Of course, one visit is not enough; keep calling to establish closeness and brotheriiness. Where necessary, regular Bible studies can be started to strengthen their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Not only the servants, but each Christian in the congregation should join in this work. There are many times when we find that we have </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 7, col. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1) </span><span class="font11">1967 service year ended with August, and now we are heading into a new service year. Now we can begin to plan our lives a whole year in advance and, if Jehovah wills, we will follow through on these plans, getting to meetings regularly and out in the field service, helping people that are interested to become disciples. And what a fine theme we have for the first month of our new service year, “Preserving Our Possession of Christian Peace”! We saw that possession in action at the assemblies this summer. What Christian peace there was! We will keep on preserving it, and as we do we are going to make disciples of more people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah's blessing be your portion. Be assured of our warm love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: •‘Disciple-making” District Assembly. Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Introduction, text, comments and assembly highlights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman: Our entire program is going to be a review of the “Disciple-making” District Assembly. (Based on “Kingdom Ministry” insert) How much do you remember of what you heard and saw? How much have you started to apply in your own life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstration: Youngster starts enthusiastically: “Daddy, you said that tonight we were going to review the convention. May we start now?” Father: “In just a minute. First, let’s read our text for today.” After text, briefly review with family the seven questions on page 4 under heading “Did You Note These Points?” Answers on page 6; put them in own words. Make the points clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Let Down Your Nets for a Catch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Points from assembly in connection with field ministry. Use material In paragraphs 1 to 7 of insert, and other items you may recall. Ask questions on printed material. Emphasize application. What are we personally doing to apply this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Guidance for Our Lives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregation book study group, assigned in advance, discuss after weekly study what they learned from assembly that deals with our personal needs in life. Base comments on paragraphs 10 to 17 of insert. Have the group on the platform. Rehearse carefully in advance. Make it lively, pointed. Highlight key thoughts. Talk about how to apply these things in one’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: “Living by Divine Principles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Several mature publishers, relaxing at home together, discuss convention material. Programs in hand, call to mind parts dealing with principles. Include comments in paragraphs 18 to 23 of insert. Emphasize the importance of learning to think in terms of principles and being guided by them. 10 min: Concluding comments. Overseer covers insert material on “What Does the Future Hold?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discuss “Special Magazine Distribution,” then local service arrangements. Encourage all to read in advance material from “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot” to be discussed next week. Song 110.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: .Walking Worthily in the Way of Peace. Song 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Introduction, text, comments and Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3 min: Report by accounts servant, including brief remarks on audit covering past three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) In after-study discussion, publisher explains to Bible student the Importance of having accurate knowledge in order to please Jehovah. (Based on pages 5-7 of “Your Word” book) Point out that those desiring to get baptized are first urged to read the “Impossible to Lie” and “Life Everlasting” books. Then arrangements are made for them to meet with overseer of congregation for series of spiritually upbuilding discussions in preparation. When person decides to get baptized, if he makes that known to overseer, he will supply candidate for immersion with copy of book “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot,” which provides outline of things they will discuss together as well as explanation of organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman: Some months have passed. Time for baptism near. One planning to get baptized is preparing for meeting with overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(15 min.) Bible student asks publisher if he (or she) will help to prepare for meeting with overseer. Concerned, cannot seem to remember all the scriptures. Publisher explains that is not required. Simply be able to answer in own words, briefly and to the point. If can add a scripture, fine, but no memorization test. Concentrate on how information affects own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To illustrate, publisher asks Bible student the first fifteen questions (pp. 7-12, concluding with points on prayer). Keep answers simple; occasionally quote a scripture. Note instructions in brackets on pages 8, 9. Bible student’s book should be closed. 10 min: Discuss branch letter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cover material starting at bottom of page 12 (What is the kingdom of God?) through point on personal study on page 19. Chairman asks questions; audience invited to answer in own words. Encourage several brief comments on each question, some incorporating scriptures. Books may be open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Presenting “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(15 min.) Suggested sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Coping with the Problems of Delinquency</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:1-5—Increase of persons “disobedient to parents,” “fierce,” and loving pleasure</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:15-17—Bible training a powerful influence to cope with problems of delinquency</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After introduction, appropriate to your territory, you might say: Tn the world today we are faced with an increase of lawlessness. Delinquency is in evidence among young people and adults alike. What does it mean? What can be done to protect ourselves and our families? I would like to call your attention to this Bible prophecy recorded in 2 Timothy 3:1-5. It shows that these conditions are evidence that we live in the “last days” of present wicked system of things; righteous new system of God’s making lies ahead. (Not necessary to read all verses, but emphasize “last days,” “disobedient to parents,” “fierce” and “lovers of pleasures.” Tie in with current happenings.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•With growing delinquency all around us. what can we do to protect ourselves and our children? flow can we fortify our children so that they will continue in right way? Verse 15 tells of a young man who was helped to pursue right course even in immoral, pagan world because he was taught the Bible. All of us can benefit from learning and following the inspired counsel in the Scriptures. (Read verses 16, 17.)’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discuss sermon with audience, then have it demonstrated, breaking off just before displaying and offering “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Now, how are we going to tie in subscription offer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two publishers on platform discuss what to say about magazine. Notice that the sermon concludes by directing attention to the Bible. October 8 issue builds confidence in Bible, fortifies one’s faith against those who discard and belittle high moral standard of Scriptures. Bible provides the guidance that enables us to cope successfully with the problems of delinquency; need strong faith in it. Comment that October 22 “Awake!” on “Youth and Drug Addiction” also ties in nicely. Right on its front cover it asks the questions: “How can you safeguard yourself? your family?” The magazine answers those questions with Bible principles. In encouraging householder to take subscription, many publishers have found it helpful to point to the box listing articles to appear in the next issue, or they show several back issues on varied topics, or display the magazine in several languages. These things have helped householders to decide they want the subscription, not just a single issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Briefly demonstrate now how to conclude sermon with subscription offer, using suggestions just discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even where subscriptions are not obtained, likely it will often be possible to place individual copies of magazines 10 min: Concluding comments. Include Question Box. Song 57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(If you have a fifth meeting in September, reserve the information outlined above concerning the sermon for October for use on that fifth meeting. Plan the remainder of the meeting locally.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Preach Release to Babylon’s Captives. Song 96.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Introduction, text, comments, followed by discussion of theme for the month: &quot;Preach Release to Babylon’s Captives.” (See “Watchtower,” October 1, 1967.) Stress urgency of work; encourage follow-up on any who show interest to help them while there is yet time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Family, after evening meal, has delightful, fast-moving review of some basic teachings of the Bible. Use points in “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot,” starting at the bottom of page 19 (Who is the Devil?) and concluding with the law covenant, on page 25. A closed-book review. 15 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers, also several short interviews with mature publishers on benefits they personally receive from doing door-to-door work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Offering “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Three brief Magazine Day presentations, two of which should feature special “Awake!” By repetition on part of chairman as scene changes from one call to the next, draw attention to key thoughts used. Encourage all to put forth extra effort in magazine distribution this month. 10 min: Concluding comments. Refer to slogan on page 8. Mention announcement on page 7 concerning new public talks; stimulate interest in talk for this week. Song 10.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>OUR &quot;DISCIPLE-MAKING&quot; DISTRICT ASSEMBLY</span></h1>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Let Down Your Nets for a Catch”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup>My, wasn’t that a wonderful assembly we just had! The best yet, so many brothers are saying. And, indeed, it was packed full of spiritual goodness, with fine counsel to help us make disciples of people of all nations, as Jesus commanded. (Matt. 28:19) Didn’t you thrill to the talk “Let Down Your Nets for a Catch”? Just as the apostles twice enjoyed big catches of fish when they obeyed Jesus’ command to ‘let down their nets for a catch,’ so likewise we are assured of a catch if we let down our nets at every opportunity. (Luke 5:1-10; John 21: 1-14) How timely was the counsel that our “spiritual fishing operations must go on”! The criticalness of the hour is no reason for any of us “fishers of men” to hang up our nets and quit the fishing work. Yes, though some of our fishing grounds are often worked and may almost seem depleted of “fish,” yet the letting down of our nets by Kingdom preaching “always results in catching some who become dedicated, baptized disciples of the Chief Fisher Jesus Christ,” as the speaker said.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> So, brothers, with that good counsel, we want to let down our nets whenever possible, knowing that the Chief Fisher can bless our efforts with a surprise catch. And what a joy it was to receive another instrument to help us “fish”—the new, delightfully illustrated book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation f </span><span class="font12">This fresh discussion of the subject will help us do a specialized fishing to ‘catch alive’ many who have been deceived by evolution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Then there was the fine counsel that, “if possible, let those who are able to do so move their ‘boats’ to untouched fishing grounds or to where more ‘fishers of men’ could be used to take care of the big catch that is apparently possible.” Some of us may be able to do this as full-time pioneer fishers. And what blessings these full-time fishers have! As we learned, there is no reason to feel sorry for them. They are rich toward God, with spiritual blessings that frequently are ten- and fifteen-fold that of a ten-hour publisher. If you cannot pioneer, can you move your ‘boat’? Why not speak with your circuit servant about that possibility the next time he visits your congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What encouragement we fishers who have territory where we can hardly even discuss the Bible with the people received! The stirring Exodus drama about Pharaoh, Moses and Aaron was just what we needed. It spurred us to keep on going back, just as Moses and Aaron went back to hardhearted Pharaoh. If we keep going back, we will rejoice in victory as Israel did over Pharaoh’s forces drowned in the roaring waters. Can’t you still hear the exulting chorus, “Sing a song to Jehovah”? We really got the right view of our work ahead: That despite the apathy and indifference of many people, some “fish” will be found by letting down the nets. So, brothers, don’t let indifference discourage you, but, as we were encouraged, let’s put forth greater efforts when the going is the toughest!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If there was any trace of doubt as to whether we should keep letting our nets down in waters apparently depleted of “fish,” certainly it was dispelled by the program Sunday morning. Remember the question, ‘Why preach, since almost all will be resurrected anyway?’ And the answer: Keep on preaching, because for by far the majority of people now alive resurrection may not become possible, since they will probably live until Armageddon. Our preaching can help some of them survive that war instead of being destroyed everlastingly. It is only a small minority who might have the possibility of a resurrection because of their dying before Babylon the Great’s destruction and Armageddon. So on with the lifesaving fishing operations!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> But as we let down our nets, we certainly don’t want to bring in “unsuitable” fish, as does Christendom. No, we want to build disciples with enduring qualities. At the assembly we learned of some qualities that we should stress: heavenly wisdom; appreciation of integrity; devotion to Bible principles; faith in God’s written Word; sticking to the theocratic organization; love of God’s “sheep” and unbreakable attachment to God’s kingdom. What a fine help the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot” </span><span class="font12">will be in instilling these qualities! Did you notice the ten points on page 108 that we want to make clear to new ones before taking them in the ministry? Be sure to use them. Then there is the list of eighty questions to be asked of all preparing for baptism. Truly, we have been blessed with aids for making disciples that will endure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> So, dear brothers, having this fine view of our work ahead, let’s help new ones to become disciples. Shortly the great fishing season will be over. That time draws nearer, as evidenced by news reports around the world, so let’s busy ourselves in letting down our nets for a catch, to rescue many more out of Armageddon!</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Did You Note These Points?</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> One of the most thrilling aspects of our summer conventions is the abundance of things we learn, and often these are points that are new to many in the audience. Was the “Disciplemaking” District Assembly an exception? Absolutely not! But would you like to ask yourself a few questions to see if you remember some of the outstanding points? Instead of just reading the questions and then looking - for the answers, which will come farther on, see if you can draw the points out of your memory. If you are unsure of one, think it over for a while. Did you note these points?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">a. What is pictured by the ancient cities of refuge?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">b. How, in accord with Psalm 68:11, has ‘Jehovah given the saying,’ and how are a “large army” of women telling the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">e. What two men famous for their anti-God thinking were shown to have been influenced by Darwin’s evolution teachings?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">d. God made what provision for saving the world of mankind by blood?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">e. What is the symbolic “dragnet” mentioned by Jesus in his illustration about the Kingdom?—Matt. 13:47-49.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">f. In whom is the prophecy fulfilled, “the love of the greater number will cool off”?—Matt. 24:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">g. What modern parallel is there to the course of the Gibeonites when five kings tried to make them break their treaty with Joshua?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Maybe for you, though, some of the most meaningful things learned at the assembly were of a more personal nature. Did you note how the convention provided perceptive and loving counsel that we could apply to our very own lives?</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Guidance for Our Lives</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> ‘Why do we want life for ourselves and others?’ That was a pertinent question asked at each assembly. And surely the answer helped to guide us in the right way. After all, is it just life we seek? Or is it that we seek the opportunity to serve Jehovah eternally? Yes, we want life so that we and others may live to praise Jehovah and work with Him and our brothers. To help us be more balanced in our lives, we had fine guidance on the need to teach ourselves and others how to pray. Since praying properly is not something one instinctively knows how to do, are we taking to heart the counsel to teach new ones to pray? What steps have you taken since the assembly in teaching the ones with whom you study to pray? Have you made a diligent effort to teach your children how to pray, making God real to them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> You may recall that one speaker pointed out that prayer is one of the reasons we are never alone. We have instant access to God; he can give us immediate help. Even if we are in isolation, prayer penetrates every barrier, since God’s spirit cannot be shut out by prison bars or walls. Brothers in Cuba and Spain appreciate this right now. And it may be very important to each of us when the persecution becomes more intense.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> Valuable guidance to endure as disciples of the Lord Jesus was given in the discourse “Do You Have ‘Faith to the Preserving Alive of the Soul’?” How strongly it was stressed that regular meeting attendance is needed for a sound faith, and that unnecessarily missing meetings is often the start of shrinking back, loss of faith! Have you demonstrated your keen appreciation of this by being at all the meetings since the assembly? Have you sought ways in which you can aid others to get to Christian meetings regularly? We all agree they are vital, don’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> How thankful we can be for the guidance given us in connection with training ourselves as qualified ministers by means of the Theocratic Ministry School! Yes, this school is one from which nobody ever graduates but in which everyone can succeed. (Many have been in the school ever since it began in 1943—for 24 years.) Truly we were happy to receive the revised </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font12"> book and to learn that it contains the Progressive Speech Training material in permanent form. How many brothers did you see engrossed in the book as they moved along in the cafeteria lines?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Our conduct before others was given attention, such as in the talk in which we were reassured that our being different from the world is no cause for alarm, but that we are supposed to be different! If we aren’t, something is wrong. One speaker nicely focused in on the matter, observing: ‘Jehovah’s witnesses look different, they act differently, they talk differently and they even smell different.’ So we can rejoice that we are not marked by the ways and habits that identify the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> And, then, wasn’t this assembly outstanding for the guidance provided to youths and parents ? After attending the assembly, what do you youngsters think about the long-haired “nonconformists” who rigidly conform to a slovenly pattern? Also, do you think a youth who talks back to his parents can call himself a minister? While the comments made at the assembly on this subject may have caused a chuckle or two among adults, you young ministers appreciated how true they were, didn’t you? Above all, it was stressed that youths show they are Christ’s disciples by their interest in the ministry, by their putting it first in their lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> You parents were asked, How can you know whether you are succeeding in training your children as Christ’s disciples? If they show real love for God and are good students of his Word; if they keep their eye on the goal of serving Kingdom interests full time! But how call you be sure of these things? Only if your children speak freely to you. What causes much trouble in the homes of many worldly families is the breaking down of lines of communications, so that children do not confide in their parents. Hence, parents, by showing interest and an understanding attitude, keep the lines of communication open, and set fine examples yourselves in all things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> Really, brothers, at the heart of all this good guidance for our lives is the matter of living by Bible principles, stressed so excellently at this assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Living by Divine Principles</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> Frequently we have heard or made reference to Bible principles, but probably few of us ever appreciated the identity and application of such as much as at this assembly. It seemed so simple when the speaker explained that a Bible principle is basically a settled guide for conduct that does not necessarily carry a penalty for disobedience. A Bible law; in contrast, is an authoritative command carrying with it a penalty for disobedience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>19</sup> With these two points in mind we could better understand the many references to Bible principles we heard at the assembly and so benefit from them. Couldn’t we all agree with the speakei' when he pointed out: ‘Many people obey laws only out of fear of punishment. But we as servants of God adhere to divine principles because we love what is right and desire with all our hearts to do what Jehovah advises.’ And what benefits we receive from these Biblical principles! By staying within their guidelines, we avoid even drifting close to breaking Bible laws.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> The veiy first evening we had clearly demonstrated for us the sensible value of developing an appreciation for the principle of obedience to parents, overseers, and employers. (Eph. 6:1; Heb. 13:17; Titus 2:9) Could you see yourself in the place of one of the members of the Strong family, Will, his wife Hedda or their child? Probably we all have fit their situation at some time. But what were the results to the Strongs? Upset, hard feelings, personal injury, and don’t forget that TV that crashed to the floor. Showing respect for the principle of obedience held out great hope for improvement in the Strong family. And didn’t theii' experience help each of us Appreciate that as long as we are imperfect we will have to exert ourselves to continue to show respect for the perfect principle of obedience?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>21</sup> The principle of obedience was highlighted from another angle in the electrifying drama about the city of refuge. Loudmouthed Reuben and whining Johanan lost respect for the principle of obedience. When they did, it was just a short step to breaking God’s law concerning the city of refuge. Fear did not hold Reuben back forever. Similarly, the DeToured family were evidencing lack of respect for the principle at Hebrews 10:24, 25. That family needed to be helped to see that applying the principle about association at Christian meetings serves as a safeguard, so they would never have to be carried off to a dishonorable burial as was fat Reuben. When, as with young Caleb, Ben DeToured was helped to appreciate the dangers, the way was open for vital improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>22</sup> With our mental vision adjusted to the need to apply Bible principles, we saw ways in which they can affect our decisions daily. What did the young brother on the program do when asked to share in a political demonstration? He let the principle of neutrality influence his decision, as we heard him explain to his schoolmate. True, since Christians are guided by divine principles, those in the world may be puzzled when we stand out as being no part of the world, but even that is in accord with a principle, isn’t it?—John 15:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>23</sup> Actually, by learning to live by divine principles now we are getting ready for life in the new order. It was evident from the other absorbing dramatization we watched that God’s principles are “eternal principles.” They operated in Israel, they operate among his people today, and they will operate in the new order. How did the brother put it? ‘Armageddon will not automatically change personalities. Even resurrection from death doesn’t.’ So by working hard to put on the new personality now, and learning to conform to God’s eternal principles at this time, we make it more likely that we will be able to adjust to the new order and be forever guided by these principles.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>What Does the Future Hold?</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>24</sup> Couldn’t we all wholeheartedly agree with the statement made by the concluding speaker on Sunday, ‘It has been good to be here at the “Disciple-making” District Assembly!’? But we sat with anxious thoughts of, ‘What about next year?’ Then, as if the speaker knew our very thoughts, we heard what the future will hold, if Jehovah wills.—Jas. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>25</sup> He said that in the summer of 1968 we will have thirty to forty assemblies throughout the United States. With so many planned, we will be able to find one in just about any part of the country we would like to visit. And they probably will be moderate in size.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>26</sup> But then came the big surprise—an international assembly in 1969! Where? When? Will it be close enough that we can go? Quickly the answers started to come, just as we hoped they would.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>27</sup> In early July 1969 we hope to have two eight-day assemblies in the eastern part of the country. As they close, two will begin in the central part, and the next week two on the west coast. In August international conventions in Europe are planned, beginning in England and moving on to Germany, Italy and France in four weeks. In the fall, the series will continue in the Far East, possibly including the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. While there are yet many details to be arranged, it is evident that the future holds many blessings in the way of assemblies, if Jehovah wills.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>28</sup> With such a rich spiritual feast completed, how appropriate that as the assembly concluded we all joined in singing from our hearts “We Thank You, Jehovah!” Truly the “Disciplemaking” Assembly gave us much for which to be thankful and much to do in the days ahead.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">ANSWERS TO REVIEW QUESTIONS POSED ON PAGE 4</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">a. Jehovah’s provision for protecting us from death, because of our bloodguilt, through Jesus' ransom sacrifice and Christ's services as God’s great High Priest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">b. In 1914 Jehovah gave the saying for the ouster of the enemy nations on earth, and thousands of faithful women, a &quot;large army,” aid in making known this good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">c. Friedrich Nietzsche, who invented the phrase “God is dead,” and Karl Marx, the “father” of modern communism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">d. The only blood that today has any value before God in saving mankind is that shed by Jesus Christ as a ransom. Use of blood in transfusions is contrary to God’s law and is a desecration that draws the attention of mankind away from God’s provision for life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">e. It is the earthly organization professing to be God's congregation, including true and false claimants of Christianity. Of course, Christendom collects unsuitable “fish,” while the anointed Christians gather in “fish” suitable to God for the heavenly kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">f. This is especially evident among those in Christendom </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">claiming</span><span class="font10"> to serve God but who have let what love for God and neighbor they had cool off. Also, some among God’s people have been affected and lost their love, thus joining the majority in the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">g. As the Gibeonites took the initiative to make a treaty with Joshua (Greek, Jesus), the “great crowd” take advantage of the time by establishing friendly relations with Jesus. So, when the ruling elements and armies of this world put pressure on them, they do not give in, confident that God, through Jesus, will rescue them out of Armageddon for taking his side now.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Our Peace &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">time to call on someone or make a phone call for encouragement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> When visiting, it is not necessary always to go directly into the person’s problem, if he has one, but at times just friendliness and encouragement will strengthen an individual to solve his own problem. But what .can we plan ahead to say? Paul said: “If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any sharing of spirit, if any tender affections and compassions, make my joy full.” (Phil. 2:1, 2) Give any encouragement ; have genuine interest in their families; share the good things occurring in Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Time is short. Much is to be done. During September we will continue to offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book, along with a booklet, and follow up with back-calls and Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> In the past few months many more people have been awakened to liear God’s Word. Those who love what is right can see more plainly now that the spirit of this entire old system of things is bad and are observing the great contrast made manifest by Jehovah’s spirit upon his people. Take advantage of this and give all possible help to the many who will hear during the coming year.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>A New Chart</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It was away back in 1943 that the Society first provided congregations with charts on which to display their monthly field service report. Having this available for ready consultation has been encouraging and stimulating to many of us. But it is not something that we discuss at every meeting, so in the future it will not be on display down in front at your Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Starting in September 1967 we will be using a smaller chart, one measuring just 3 % x 8 % inches. As in the past, the report will be discussed each month at the service meeting. Then, for any who may want to consult it again, it will appear on the new “Congregation Field Ministry” chart on the information board. There is room for four months of the report on one side and four months on the reverse side of the chart; and when both sides are filled, it may be filed with the congregation records. Each congregation is being sent a two-year supply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Each month the assistant congregation servant will take down the chart and enter the service report for the month, preferably using pen and ink. If there is someone else who can draw in the figures very neatly, he may ask that one to help out so that the chart will be neat and legible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When you look at the new chart, you will observe that the report of the pioneers is no longer separated from the rest. The totals for hours, back-calls, studies and placements combine the work of both congregation publishers and pioneers. However, the total number reporting as pioneers and the number reporting as congregation publishers are shown, because this is something that the congregation likes to know. Also, congregation publisher averages are listed for the benefit of those who would like to compare their personal report with the congregation averages.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is good for all of us to take a keen interest in what we are individually doing in the field ministry. There is much to be done, and we ought to have a feeling of urgency about it. “W’hatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah.”—Col. 3: 23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazine Distribution</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Are you ready for October, with its special magazine distribution? This is a month when we will be featuring magazines even more than ordinarily, spending more than usual of our service time placing Individual magazines, and obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake I</span><span class="font11"> wherever possible. Have you ordered needed supplies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Consider the special October 8 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> with its discussion of “Digging Up Bible History—How It Affects You.” In a time when so many people are trying to downgrade the Bible, here is something designed to fortify them against the critics and to strengthen their faith. It is just what we need. The October 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> features the convention talk “Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon,&quot; with its urgent appeal to people to act while there is yet time. The October 22 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> strikingly highlights the subject “Youth and Drug Addiction.” This is a topic that deeply concerns people everywhere. The magazine asks and answers the key questions: “How can you safeguard yourself? your family?” Their interest in this may be a steppingstone to reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How many extra copies of these magazines would you personally like to have for use in your ministry? Have you told your magazine-territory servant so that the order can be sent to the Society? Now is the time to plan so that we can share to the full in the service planned for October.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were 250,226 books placed during July. Truly, an outstanding report! Think of how many persons will be benefited from considering the fine Scriptural information contained in these Bible-study aids. No doubt in many cases effective use of the publications was demonstrated right on the initial call. We know that assistance of this sort is needed to make disciples. Just placing literature is not enough in Itself. So, patiently many return calls were made and Bible studies conducted during July, and we will continue to do so with Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While for many July was a time for vacations and relaxation, we were still “buying out the opportune time” to help our neighbors get “a firm hold on the real life.’’—1 Tim. 6:19.</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_196709_files/km_E_196709-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:284pt;height:51pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Searching Out Deserving Ones</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When giving instructions to his disciples for the witness work, Jesus said: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (Matt. 10:11) To search would require thoroughness. It would necessitate a call at every house, giving each and every person, impartially, the opportunity to hear the good news. Only in this way could they be sure to find the deserving ones; and since it was Jehovah’s means for doing so, this method, the house-to-house work, would receive his blessing and form the foundation of their field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The situation has not changed. The door-to-door work, where we have the opportunity to “search out” deserving ones, is still Jehovah’s way and is a source of real joy, just as it was to Jesus’ disciples, who returned to him with thrilling reports. (Luke 10:17, 18) What a privilege to search out and help every deserving one in your territory! Balancing our activities to do this fundamental work will ensure thrilling results to us also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Are you experiencing the pleasures of the door-to-door work regularly? If so, we know that you appreciate its value. Perhaps, though, you are one who began to serve in the magazine work some time ago but hasn’t as yet engaged in the regular door-to-door service with the sermon. Or, it may be that you are experienced in this service, but perhaps it has been a little while since you shared In its joy. Undoubtedly you have been thinking about enlarging your privileges along this line. Since we want to make advancement and the time constantly grows shorter, now would be a good time to advance fully into the door-to-door work. Your brothers will work with you, if you wish, until you gain full confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■* There is a possibility you have found that other features of service have kept you so busy lately that this service has been crow'ded out. Maybe you are a busy housewife, faithfully caring for home and family while conducting a number of home Bible studies. That is fine! You certainly do not want to neglect your students, for they need regular help to progress in knowledge and become associated with us in serving Jehovah. Even so, there may be ways to work in some house-to-house work. You will have to decide how it can be done after taking into consideration home duties and the needs of the newly interested ones. Perhaps two studies can be combined, or one or more studies can be turned over to other capable publishers, Consider your circumstances and see what can be done so that you can enjoy at least some regular door-to-door work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We know that the most important reasons why we do the door-to-door work are to sanctify Jehovah's name and to locate sheepilke ones, but it is also good to reflect on the personal spiritual benefits that it brings. It performs an invaluable service in strengthening you and perfecting your faith. Mature publishers know the value of it. Timidity and hesitancy in the ministry are soon overcome. Your ability to defend the faith is greatly sharpened because you learn to use the “sword of the spirit” better. Your enjoyment grows as you become equipped by experience to “make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you.” —1 Pet. 3.15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Nothing can substitute for the door-to-door work in giving you the exhilarating feeling of courage, with Jehovah at your very side and his invisible host backing up what you say with a stirring Amen! (Acts 18: 9,10; Rev. 7:10-12) What an excellent opportunity it affords to develop and perfect the fruits of the spirit. Jehovah’s spirit is right there with you, and you are conscious of it, because you have so many demands for its help. What requires, for example, a combination of peace, long-suffering, kindness and self-control more often in a day than door-to-door work? These fruits of the spirit, in turn, kindie a flame of zeal and a sense of spiritual well-being. Why, it could be said that we need the house-to-house work just as much as the people we talk to need it I Surely it is a provision of Jehovah in so many vital respects, as we work for our own salvation and the salvation of others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Because rendezvous for service is a more accurate expression in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A center is a location around which certain activity revolves; in fact, it is the most important point in relation to that activity. Viewed from the standpoint of the congregation, the center from which our field service is directed is the Kingdom Hall. It is there that we receive service instructions, territory assignments and literature supplies, Isn't it? The congregation book study groups do not carry on their activities independently from the Kingdom HaU but in close cooperation with those who gather there. So, when we keep in mind that all the book study groups make up Just one congregation, it becomes evident that really the service center for each congregation is the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other hand, a rendezvous (pronounced: rtln'divtl) is any place appointed for assembling or meeting. It can refer to the Kingdom Hall, the places where we hold our congregation book studies or any other location that may be designated as a place of meeting, either for study or to organize and prepare a group for participation in the field service. That is why the Society is now using the expression rendezvous for service to refer to places designated for groups to meet for field service.</span></p>

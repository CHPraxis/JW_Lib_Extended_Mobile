<p><span class="font8">Wasn’t it just fine to have those outstanding </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> issues to distribute during the past few months? The contents were so timely and appropriate to the days in which we live! And already letters from all across the country tell about the joys you had in spreading this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scores of congregations have reported placing hundreds of extra copies of the April 22 issue on “Evolution or Creation by God— Which?” Orders for 500 extra copies were common, and some congregations asked for two or three thousand additional copies. Many school students grasped the opportunity of speaking to teachers and offered this magazine to fellow students. Some even had the privilege of speaking before the whole class on the highlights in this </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After you distributed copies to the teachers, some individual teachers as well as high school and university faculties ordered extra copies direct from the Society. Explained one biology professor in an Eastern university: “I would like my students to use </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> as basis for a written discussion about the two opposing views on Evolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And here are some appreciative comments from readers. “You people have outdone yourselves this time,” wrote a Catholic. “Well presented and most thought-provoking,” said a biology teacher. “Just what is needed here in the South where the issue of Evolution in the schools is now very much to the fore,” wrote another. “One of the most enlightening articles on Evolution I have come across in all of my studies,” was the appraisal of a West Coast correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The May 22 issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> on “Your Freedom to Choose Medical Treatment Endangered!” is also being widely distributed, and with excellent response. One lawyer wrote: “I appreciate very much your making me more aware of the ex</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">&quot;All the More So&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Are you glad that you have remained faithful until now? Certainly! Are you also happy that your brothers have? Of course! Do you think that our regularly attending meetings together has contributed toward our spiritual strength and thus our maintaining of integrity? Without a doubt!—Jas. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> This being true, what should be our attitude toward meeting together in the days ahead as the end of the old system draws near and the outside pressures increase? The apostle Paul provides the answer in the verses that support our theme for the month of July. Read carefully Hebrews 10 : 23-25 and note Paul’s encouragement to meet together and build one another up and to do this </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">all the more so</span><span class="font8"> as we “behold the day drawing near.” Obviously, then, we will need to give even more attention to supporting God’s house in the time ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Of course, when we think of meetings we think of our congregation, and the congregation is made up of people. The congregation is not the Kingdom Hall; it is you along with others like you. This helps us to appreciate that we all have privileges and responsibilities in the congregation, and there can be a great deal of joy and satisisting conditions.” A district court judge, speaking about the difficulties in reaching a decision in blood transfusion cases, declared: “I would be a little better able to do so because of the material which you sent.” And a member of the Colorado House of Representatives invited the publisher who furnished the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> to phone anytime to discuss the subject.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The diligence shown by all of you publishers, and the fine response to these particular issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">by the public in general and by educators, lawyers and legislators, have certainly registered here at the faction in knowing that we, personally, add something spiritual to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">••What might we do during July and in coming months to build up our own appreciation and that of others for the meetings? We could spend some time thinking of the value and purpose of each meeting. We might review our own arrangements for attending, making adjustments for improvement, if necessary. It would be upbuilding to offer a word of encouragement to some who miss occasionally. We might arrange to be at meetings early, have a part with the entire congregation in the opening song, maybe one of the new ones, and then join in the opening prayer. Appreciate that these additional efforts we put forth during July could easily start better habits that might well continue In force thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Is July your vacation month? Why not find out where there is a Kingdom Hall near where you will be and attend? Brothers who make it a point to do this say that the memories they later cherish and talk about are those having to do with brothers they met and meetings and service they enjoyed to-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Society’s factory. Do you know that our production of the April 22 English issue in Brooklyn alone amounted to 4,230,000 copies? This is almost double our normal figure and the most ever printed for a single Issue! And, If we include production for Canada and Britain, the total of this issue reaches 5,264,000!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us all go on holding to the custom of not neglecting the house of our God—for this is the course that-will equip us to share in many other fine campaigns in the months ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Be a Contributor of Spiritual Encouragement. (Heb. 10:25) Song 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “All the More So.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate some points. Points in paragraph four might be demonstrated by father discussing with family what they will do during July in order to make certain adjustments and improvements in connection with meetings, such as preparing for them, getting there ahead of time, eliminating things that sometimes cause them to miss, getting children to start preparing student talks early, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Presenting the offer for July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 min.) Chairman mentions choice of offering either “Impossible to Lie” or “Life Everlasting’’ with a booklet for 50c. Encourages all to be well prepared, not just with sermon, but with transition and fine presentation of literature. Well to be prepared to </span><span class="font10">8 </span><span class="font7">resent either one in event house-older has the one you first present. Excellent reception these books have already enjoyed shows their value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(8 min.) Have capable publisher, prepared In advance, demonstrate how he will present one of the books, and then a different publisher can do the same with the other book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Chairman comments on good points made, then concludes &quot;with kindly encouragement for all to have full share in covering territory with these fine Bible-study aids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">6 min: “1967 Conventions.” Talk. Draw audience into discussion on major points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">2 min: Accounts servant report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: Concluding comments. Consider “How Did We Do in May?” and local service report. Song 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Be a Teacher in All Your Ministerial Activity. (Rom. 12:8) Song 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">18 min: “He That Presides.” Questions and answers. Might demonstrate thoughts in paragraphs five and six by chairman Interviewing “Watchtower” study servant concerning lesson for next Sunday. He can comment on what major points in lesson are and how he intends to focus minds of audience on these in his introduction and during the lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Branch letter. Talk. Bring audience Into discussion on outstanding points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">17 min: Starting studies during July. We know that the books we will be placing during July are two of the finest Bible-study aids available. This being true, we will by all means want to keep the starting of home Bible studies in mind and make this our Soal each time we make the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">hairman can highlight these thoughts and then single out major points in article, “Presenting the Good News— At New Home Bible Studies,” on page four of the January 1967 “Kingdom Ministry.” Article should not be rehashed, but ideas concerning using own good judgment in what publication to use and where to start can be emphasized. However, inasmuch as we are offering either &quot;Impossible to Lie” or “Life Everlasting” this month, we will want to be especially well prepared to start studies In these two books. After making these points the chairman can have two well-prepared demonstrations, one for each book, showing in a simple, practical way how studies might be started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate items from Theocratic News. Might comment on slogan on page four. Song 72.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Share with the One Teaching. (Gal. 6:6) Song 67.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 20 min: “Share with the One Teaching.” Question-and-answer coverage, with demonstrations to emphasize some main points. Mother with unbelieving husoand could be Instructing children, helping them to prepare some comments so they can share in meeting. She also reasons with them on importance of commenting. Or, possibly a capable publisher could be talking to one with whom he conducts study. Student has just begun attending meetings and needs encouragement regarding the principle of sharing at meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Question Box. A talk, but drawing audience into discussion on main points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “How to Make Your Vacation More Satisfying.” Discussion on fine suggestions in July 8 &quot;Awake!” Family group can be shown discussing material with appreciation, planning to apply these suggestions during their coming vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Include applicable announcements. Song 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Keep Useful Habits by Good Associations. (1 Cor. 15:33) Song 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk (about 8 min.) on theme for month. See August 1, 1967, “Watchtower.” Then speaker asks if any have questions and calls brother who raises hand to platform. Father says son argues &quot;dating” one not in truth can’t be so bad. (Might use other objections appropriate for your locality or congregation.) Chairman reasons with him in kindly way, driving home in Scriptural and logical manner the main points of his talk. Brother appreciates thoughts. Agrees that son has allowed himself to get a little unbalanced in his reasoning. Will use this fine material in counseling him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: &quot;Presenting the Good News— Caring for Isolated Ones.” Talk, possibly by magazine-territory servant. Apply to local congregation. If working in well-covered home territory, might encourage publishers to concentrate on working it thoroughly, seeking to cultivate all interest found. 18 min: Experiences Build Up. Chairman discusses (about 3 min.) how’ relating good experiences can build up others. Doing this caused great joy among early Christians. (Acts 15:3) We should never minimize our experiences in Jehovah’s service, feeling they were not exceptional. If all felt that way, we would certainly miss many fine benefits, wouldn’t we? By our recalling and recounting how Jehovah has blessed us in the ministry others are greatly encouraged and stimulated to make public declaration. Then chairman can review (about 6 min.) main points in article, “Heard at the Bethel Dinner Table,” in July 22 “Awake!” Show how Bethel family is built up by arrangements for discussing text, hearing &quot;Yearbook” experiences read at breakfast and hearing brothers tell experiences at noon meal. Then chairman (about 9 min.) interviews publishers who have had experiences with &quot;Impossible to Lie” and “Life Everlasting” books. These can be experiences of almost any kind. Did you place book in house-to-house work? Why did householder take it? Are you conducting a home Bible study in one of the books? What has student especially enjoyed? How have you benefited? Have you placed a book in incidental witnessing? How was this done? Was a study started? What progress is being made? Have you enjoyed your personal study of these books? Why? What chapters impressed you especially, and why? Chairman shows how almost any experience we have had with “Impossible to Lie” and “Life Everlasting” books can be upbuilding to ourselves and others and will help us as we continue to offer them during August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Song </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">114.</span><span class="font7">_____________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“All the More So” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">gether, not just the scenery they saw or recreation in which they engaged. Or, is July your assembly month? Then attendance will still be a key word for you as you enjoy each session with your brothers. What of those who remain at home? With fewer there to contribute to the meetings, these will by all means want to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> But our worship Includes more than attending meetings. Yes, the meetings help us to serve Jehovah better, and so what we learn there we will want to use in the field. Jesus said, “What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light; and what you hear whispered, preach from the housetops.’’ (Matt. 10:27) Thus during July we will be offering the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font8"> book, whichever you decide, with a booklet, for 50c. Appreciating what excellent instruments they are in teaching new ones the truth, we will not hesitate to recommend them whenever we can, but especially from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> What a blessing to have a congregation to be associated with and to support! What a blessing to attend each meeting, giving of ourselves and also regularly carrying away life-sustaining spiritual food and encouragement! Let us ‘hold to the custom of not neglecting God’s house’ during July, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“all the more so&quot;</span><span class="font8"> as “the day” of Jehovah draws near.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARE WITH THE ONE TEACHING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “My, what a responsive and outgoing group!” Have you ever said that after visiting another congregation? Possibly, and maybe others have said it about yours. Just what do we have in mind in describing a congregation in this way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Responsiveness refers to the response from the audience or the comments they make at any time when the opportunity is presented to contribute. To be outgoing is to be anxious to give of oneself, doing so willingly when there is an opportunity to share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Why is sharing so important in the congregation? Primarily, because Jehovah wants us to be that way. Note the principle laid down by Paul: “Moreover, let anyone who is being orally taught the word share in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching.” —Gal. 6:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">* In what way is commenting for our good? It strengthens our own faith when we speak out and put our thoughts into words. Having expressed the thought at a meeting, we are confident that we can repeat it in the witness work.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Literature offer for July, August and September: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie&quot;</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God,</span><span class="font7"> and a booklet, for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Suggested discussions for meetings for service: July 9: Consider appropriate talking points for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">’Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font7"> book.

<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> How do others benefit when we share? The conviction we show in our comments is faith-strengthening to others. We might contribute a point others hadn’t thought of. Participation demonstrates wholehearted unity. If you comment, then others will be assured that you believe what is being studied and thus they will be built up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> “But,” you say, &quot;it requires a lot of study for one to be able to participate in all the meetings, and if I am not thoroughly prepared I don’t like to answer.” Is this the right way to feel? Really, it is not. Usually if we set our minds to it we can get much of our studying done. But if we cannot, then we should try to participate anyway.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>&quot;He That</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul said, as recorded at Romans 12:8, “He that presides, let him do it in real earnest.” When it is your privilege to preside, do you do it in this way?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In Christendom’s “churches&quot; one man, usually, presides. In our congregations, many have that opportunity. The servants and others having major assignments on the service meeting, all, periodically, preside.</span></p></li>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1967 Conventions</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Several of this year's “Disciplemaking” District Assemblies are now history. Surely those who have attended will say, “My cup is well filled.”—Ps. 23:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> By far the greater number of the assemblies are left. If you have not yet attended, why not select a city near where you live and consummate your plans to attend? Do it now 1 Not only do we urge you to attend all sessions, but we encourage you to take newly interested ones along with you to the assembly, if possible. Also, in the assembly city as you share in the house-to-house work, street magazine and advertising work, make it a special point to encourage those that you meet to attend both the public talk and other sessions. A rich blessing awaits those who do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Do not hold back. Send your request for rooming accommodations to the convention city of your choice. Be on hand to share in the blessings being enjoyed at the assemblies by Jehovah’s people this summer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">If occasionally pressed for time, why not at least </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">read</span><span class="font8"> the lesson before going to the meeting? Then you will undoubtedly be able to offer at least some brief comments as you follow along. Don’t be reluctant ; remember, Jehovah’s spirit will be there at the meeting to help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> How will all this help in the field ministry? Speaking at the meetings will help us to be more poised in the field service. Also, if we appreciate the Bible principle of sharing, then we will impart that same spirit to the ones with whom we have home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Participating freely, then, is a Bible requirement. But it also provides many blessings. We don't want to be the kind who only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">take </span><span class="font8">at meetings. We will also want to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">give.</span><span class="font8"> So, especially during July, as we build increased appreciation for God’s house, let us cultivate the spirit of sharing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">gregation to have this variety in teachersl . We benefit immensely, in different ways, from each one. But what a responsibility they shoulder! To quite some extent, the spiritual health of the congregation depends upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Is it possible to bear such a serious responsibility and also find happiness in doing so? Certainly! Remember, Paul also said, &quot;If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.” Jehovah would never have Instituted this arrangement if happiness in it were not possible. The happiness comes, however, only when it is done </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">in real earnest. </span><span class="font8">—1 Tim. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Thorough preparation is necessary for one who presides. Why? Well, some In the audience are new and expect clarification of points they do not understand. Even some long in the truth occasionally have difficulty in grasping certain points that are involved and deep. Besides, do any of us really have enough ’ time to study everything as thoroughly as we would like to?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Before the meeting the one presiding might ask himself, Can I Isolate the few really major points in the lesson and state them in that many brief sentences? At the end of the lesson lie might ask himself if he actually did highlight these major points and if he believes the brothers understood them and will remember them. Yes, one who presides should study so he can explain and simplify where necessary. In harmony with our</span></p>

Perhaps a year’s subscription for one of the magazines and a bound book, such as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie,’ </span><span class="font8">could be offered, with four book-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“He That Presides&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">( Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">theme for July, tills will be a good month for those who preside to consider how they can make improvement.—Rom. 2: 21; Neh. 8: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' There is another way in which a good teacher helps a congregation. This is by the example he sets as a student. We all need a good example to follow, and one who has a deep love for the truth and is a student because of this certainly is a fine influence on others. The knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s ways that he has acquired demonstrate to others that it can be done, and it will stimulate In them the desire to make the truth their own.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> But how do these thoughts on presiding apply to the rest of the congregation? Well, don’t we all have the opportunity to apply these principles in our witnessing activity? Of course, and especially in our Bible study work. Paul also pointed out that this applied to the head of the house, when he said that an overseer should be “a man presiding over his household in a tine manner.” (1 Tim. 3:4) Even those giving student talks in the Theocratic Ministry School will want to apply these principles to their assignments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Some might feel that they do not have the ability to meet this high standard. None should feel this way. If you have been appointed to lets, for $1.50. Of course, those who are very much Interested in our work can be shown many other publications. We can point out that we get around in their territory only once a year, and perhaps they would like to have more than just a subscription to one of the magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers arrange to spend one weekend out of each month in such territory, staying in a motel or rooming house, enjoying a full Saturday and Sunday in the service. Such a fine weekend gives them a taste of the joys of this work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> We always look forward to the interesting reports and experiences that are sent in at the close of each summer from those who had a part in caring for isolated ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">that position, continue applying yourself to the assignment. Jehovah, by means of his spirit, will make up for any lack that you feel. This was what occurred in Moses’ case, and look how he was blessed. —1 Pet. 4:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> Yes, he that presides has much to do. But what a privilege to be used by Jehovah, the great Teacher, in this way today!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstandingly well! Have some gotten the impression that less interest is being found and less zeal is being shown by our brothers? If so, they will have to change their view! After just completing the best subscription campaign ever, we can now compare May 1967 to May 1966. A total of 317,289 publishers reported; 8.938 more than last year. They did better in hours, back-calls and Bible studies. They placed 231,976 bound books, which was 6,899 more than May 1966, and averaged 11.8 magazines as compared to 11.0 last year. While we are not overly concerned with figures, we are interested in what these can reveal or indicate. May’s report indicates cause for rejoicing and reason for optimistically pushing ahead.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question J3ox</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">• Should we have our meetings listed on the religious page of newspapers along with those of Babylon the Great?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We should take advantage of all appropriate opportunities to advertise the Kingdom. Such listings, usually provided free as a service to the community, have been helpful in breaking down prejudice and in letting interested persons know how to find us. Paid advertising is not recommended, however. If this is simply a providing of Information concerning addresses, times and days of meetings, very likely there would be no objection to our being included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, sometimes more is involved. Some newspapers will Include statements to the effect that all those listed are joined together in a purpose that we know Is contrary to Bible principles. We could not be included in this. On the other hand, these statements may be of such a nature that they do not give a wrong Impression. The symbol of a cross or picture of a church or some similar thing at the top of the page may not necessarily rule out our using this page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who is to decide if the arrangement is a good one? The congregation servant. If he is in doubt, he can discuss this with other mature ones and with the circuit servant when he visits. If the brothers locally keep alert to these possibilities, advantageous advertising can be arranged and that which is objectionable can be avoided.</span></p>

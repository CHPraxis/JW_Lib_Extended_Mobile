<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Wo. (jUg</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">This morning, which is July 13, the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font11"> second section headline, said: “A National Historic Landmark Is Due for a Facelift.” Underneath that heading was a picture of property the Society had purchased some years ago. Right below it there was a picture of the model building that will replace the present structure with the caption: “A model of the same corner showing proposed change. The modern structure is a plan for the Watch Tower Society dormitory and classroom building, which was not opposed.” Then came another three-column headline: “Old Brooklyn Heights Is Taki ng. a Forward Step.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, all of the members of the Bethel family were delighted with this news that the “Guardians of a Gentle Past Accept Modern Dormitory After Scaling It Down.” I had the privilege of reading the whole story from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> to the Bethel family. By means of our closed circuit television the family was able to see the pictures in the newspaper too. Of course, I had shown the family the model and design some weeks earlier, but what a joyful morning this was for us because now the Landmarks Preservation Commission had granted approval for the design developed by our architects, Mr. Franzen and Mr. Selden! Just the day before, at eleven o’clock in the morning on Wednesday, July 12, we appeared before the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Mr. Franzen, the designer, presented to the Commission his model of the new building and showed how it would fit in well with the present older structures on the Heights. The New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font11"> reported it this way: “Should Brooklyn Heights, recently recognised by the Federal Government as la National Historic Landmark, remain chaste and classical in its outward aspect? Or should it encourage modernity to grow alongside the prim 19th-century townhouses that line many of its narrow streets?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“There was not even a murmur</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8">Let Them Have Good Associations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Good associations, we know, are beneficial for us, but what about the other people? Who? Persons who in some way show they are interested in salvation. “ ‘Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.’ However, how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?”—Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> That the Interested people must have association with those who have the truth is best illustrated by the example of Jesus himself. In his ministry Jesus sought out others and associated with them for a purpose. He talked to all kinds of people and found some with the right heart condition. When young children were brought to him, he said: “Let the young children alone, sfnd stop hindering them from coming to me, for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to suchlike ones.” (Matt. 19:14) It was his desire that teachable ones become followers of him in serving of dissent yesterday at a public hearing on a plan to construct a modern $l-million dormitory and classroom building—a terraced structure with overhanging gardens and a slender stair tower. . . . What the guardians of the Heights want is to save the best of the old and add to it the best of what is new, the hearing was told. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society . . . went before the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, which called the hearing at City Hall. Nathan H. Knorr, the Watch Tower president was seeking a ‘certificate of appropriateness’ to allow the society to put the new brick building up on a one-halfblock site on the southeast corner of the Intersection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Immediately after the hearing the Jehovah. Some were willing and others were not. The young man mentioned in the same chapter preferred his riches to becoming a follower of Jesus and went away from association with Jesus. But the apostles continued in association with Jesus and formed useful habits by doing so. Because of their continual association with Jesus they were built up spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> However, Jesus did not continue to associate with those who did not have the right heart attitude, as is well Illustrated in Matthew chapter 13. Jesus spoke to great crowds by Illustrations, but, as verse 36 shows, he dismissed the ones who had a wrong motive and taught the meaning of his illustrations to his disciples. Such association had a marked effect on the apostles for their good. This was recognized later by the rulers: “Now when they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary, they got to wondering. And they began to recognize about them </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page !&gt;, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Commission met to further discuss the matter and on that very afternoon a letter was sent to the president of the Society by the Commission granting permission to demolish the 117-119 Columbia Heights structure and to construct a new residence building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are thankful to Jehovah God for making these provisions for expanding the work of the Society here in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the meantime all of us will keep our good associations with our brothers in the field, preaching the good news of God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May you prosper in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brother,</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep in the Habit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It has been a good year of service, and we are encouraged by it. If the month of August can show as strong a number of publishers as we had in previous months, it will contribute a good deal to the annual report for this country. Last year we had about 500,000 fewer hours In the service reported in August than in July. So what can we do to assure a good August report? Since August is a vacation month for many, it has been noted in the past that some have failed to turn in their reports. This means that they have become irregular publishers. If we keep in the good habit of making out our reports and turning them over to the congregation in August, it will help to maintain the high record of activity we have had during this service year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Of course, one cannot turn in a report unless he has kept in the habit of being in the service. Even though August may be a time for vacation and traveling, or In some places harvesttime for brothers who are working on farms or in other seasonal occupations, there is hardly a place one can think of where there would not be some contacts with other people that would present opportunities for some conversation about spiritual things. Let’s not look lightly upon incidental witnessing. Much good has been accomplished by it and it is very worth while to report it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If we all cooperate, August should have a very fine report. Parents can arrange activities for their families. In some congregations, group witnessing can be or-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 4, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Put Them in Touch</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Toward the end of August people who have gone to summer resorts, country homes or cottages at the beach begin to close up their homes in preparation for returning to the city. Have you In your witnessing during the summer encountered interested persons who will be going to their permanent residences in September? If so, it would be good to call back on these individuals once more before they leave for their permanent homes and see if you can find out where they live. If you are able to get names and addresses of interested persons, we will be pleased to receive them at Brooklyn and send them on to the congregation responsible for the territory in which the address is to be found. In this way the good seed you have planted can be watered and, with Jehovah’s blessing, there will be increase.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Walking in the Truth&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> There is no greater cause for thankfulness to parents than to know that their children are “walking in the truth.” (3 John 4) But with all the distractions that Satan uses at this time, you who are parents need to put up a hard and consistent fight to protect your children, as you know. What factors help toward success? Well, if a pioneer sister were to write to her fleshly brother, perhaps her remarks would point out some of those factors in this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup>“Dear Tom, GOOD NEWS! I have my invitation to Gilead 1 I will attend the next class. As long as I can remember I've looked forward to Gilead and a missionary assignment, and now my hope is to be a reality. I’m glad Dad and Mom always encouraged us to get into the full-time service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> “You and I have much to be grateful for. Dad and Mom were dedicated to Jehovah before we were born, but they never took for granted that we were ‘in the truth.’ Every day they helped us to grow in appreciation by teaching and by example. Remember when we were small—Dad used to sit us down on either side of him and read the Bible to us, explaining the scriptures as he went along? When we got old enough to take our turn at reading, those questions they used to ask us about the material we read really taught us to think and reason. Too, I’ve always appreciated how Dad used to pray with us at bedtime, for this taught us to rely on Jehovah. They have both worked hard at teaching to make us ‘disciples.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> “And what about meetings? The only ones we ever missed were when we were too sick. There were many times that Dad could have</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">+ In each congregation an actual count of literature should be taken early in September. We are sending out two literature inventory forms with the monthly statement. We would appreciate your filling them out and returning the original to us no later than September 5. You may keep the duplicate in your file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ For the next service year a supply of congregation monthly report cards and magazine distributors’ order blanks are being sent to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The literature offer for October will be a year's subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font10">with three booklets, for $1. The October 8 Awake.' will be a special issue on &quot;Digging Up Bible History—How It Affects You.” The October 22 issue will feature “Youth and Drug Addiction” and will have some articles on other subjects as well. Please order your extra copies during August, if possible. </span><span class="font11">made extra money by doing overtime work, but he never would if it meant missing meetings. We may not have had everything others did, but we prospered spiritually. I thought about that especially when I attended our recent circuit assembly. What an excellent program! The Saturday-night meeting should strengthen many families and keep the children ‘walking in the truth.’—2 John 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> “In my assignment there is a fine family that I have grown to love very much. Each evening at mealtime they discuss the text together and, although we are only about to begin studying the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">'Make Sure’</span><span class="font11"> book in the school, they are already discussing it together. For each night one member is assigned a subheading or two, and he must discuss it, telling how the scriptures used apply. You surely get more than just a fine meal when you are with them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> “Something else I admire about them is that they do things together as a family. The parents make sure that the children are regular in service, helping them to prepare magazine presentations and sermons. When it’s time for recreation, it’s just like it was at home, family fun. They go on hikes, to museums, or just stay home and play or work together on family projects. The way they show love to one another and others makes you feel confident that they will walk in the truth in the future, come what may.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> “I hope your next letter tells me you have been called to Bethel. We would both rejoice over that, and Dad and Mom would be happy too. Much love, Your sister.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Does that letter give you ideas that you can use? We thought it might</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It would be good to consider your inventory, and if you are overstocked in any particular booklets urge the publishers to use those as gifts </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> new Awake/ subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The audit of congregation accounts is due to be made on September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Suggested points for discussion at meetings for service: Week of August 13: How to Invite people to a public talk. August 20: what to do if no one is at home. August 27: Is your House-to-House Record guiding you back to the interested ones? September 3: How to start a Bible study on the first call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Offer for August and September: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’ </span><span class="font10">book, and a booklet, for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ If you did not get to a &quot;Disciplemaking” District Assembly as yet, be sure to do it in August.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>(Question.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">• How should we view volunteering for service at assemblies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a wonderful privilege and blessing, brothers! The Bible principle that “there is more happiness In giving than there is in receiving’’ is something you will experience firsthand in giving of yourself to the work that must be done at each assembly. A fine example of this willing spirit was the tribe of Zebulun, who were noted for their wholehearted support when there was opportunity to volunteer to help in Jenovah’s service. (Acts 20:35; 1 Chron. 12:33) Because of this they were a happy people and were blessed by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How we rejoice to see our assemblies grow In number and size each year! But with this growth comes a real need for more willing volunteers to accomplish all the work necessary in the different assembly departments. Do you feel this need? Reports indicate that it has become increasingly necessary for some of our brothers who have volunteered, to work every day throughout the assembly, missing much of the assembly program due to the lack of help in some departments. Yet this would not be the case if more volunteered; all would be able to benefit more fully from the program. So there is a real need for your help at the next assembly—will you volunteer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Who can volunteer for service? There Is work for everyone! Young brothers and sisters are in an excellent position to give of themselves wholeheartedly. The strength and vigor of our young ones can accomplish much In the cleaning, cafeteria and refreshment departments at our assemblies. Parents, do you have children old enough to enjoy a part in the work to be done? Why not have your children working with you side by side? Explain to the one In charge of volunteer service that you would like to work together. Train the children while young to offer themselves willingly to Jehovah’s service and experience the jov that results! Some parents who have children too young to work with them have arranged to take turns in caring for the children and serving in an assembly department; this, too, can be arranged by simply explaining your situation at the time you volunteer. And how encouraging it is to see our older brothers volunteering their service in caring for the contribution boxes! They may not be able to help with the more strenuous work due to their advanced age, yet they see the value of volunteering and doing what they can. This is a wonderful attitude to have!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So plan ahead to volunteer your service at the next assembly, whether a district assembly or a circuit assembly. Then take appropriate work clothes with you to the assembly. Each one should give careful consideration to volunteering his service at the assemblies of Jehovah’s people. If we view the volunteer service as a real privilege, doing what we can, we will go home from each assembly with a double blessing—having received a rich spiritual feast and having given with a whole heart.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It has a good effect on others when one is friendly and generous. Oftentimes people refuse the literature offer, but we can very generously offer a handbill or a tract. It makes you feel good as a publisher ; there Is happiness in giving. You feel you have accomplished more if you can leave something at each door. Using handbills and tracts can have a good effect on our territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In California a publisher put a handbill under the door when no one was found at home and continued witnessing down the street. A little while later a man came running down the street, looking for the publisher. When he reached the publisher, he explained that he had not been at home but that he always liked to get the magazines when they were brought to the door. Right on the spot the publisher was able to obtain two subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A circuit servant’s wife in the Netherlands rang a doorbell on magazine day. A little girl of about ten years of age opened the door. Her parents were not home but, on request, her older brother came to the door. He refused the offer of two magazines. The publisher then kindly offered him a handbill for the talk to be given that week and encouraged him to read the print on the back. After that she walked away from the door. When she had worked a few more houses, that same young man came running out of his house and asked her if she had that new Bible that was</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Have you noted in your conversations with people at the doors announced on the back of the handbill. Later that morning she brought him the Bible and he gave her enough money not only to cover the cost of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> but also to pay for the two magazines that he at first did not accept.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If your magazine territory has been worked often, you may find that good results will occur if you, for a change, begin your presentation by extending a friendly invitation to hear a public talk, and then offer the magazines. In apartment houses our offering this printed invitation sometimes helps to get people to open their doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>B</sup>But suppose your congregation does not have a public talk every week. Then it would be a good thing for the congregation to have a stock of Style No. 3 handbills, which can be used at any time to extend an invitation to attend your congregation meetings. And it is good to carry them, in the event you run out of the current handbill while In the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Especially in the summertime we often find no one at home. It costs us something to go to these places, especially so in the case of outlying territories, so it is practical always to leave something under the door.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> A good practice is always to carry a few tracts to use when an appropriate occasion presents Itself or if you run out of handbills. And both are fine instruments to have with you for your incidental witnessing. There is indeed happiness in giving something to everyone.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">or in incidental witnessing that some are willing to listen to the truth even though they may not take literature? Do you have written notations of these persons on your House-to-House Record or in a notebook? Do you let those with a spark of Interest have the benefit of good association with you through your calling back on them to tell them more of the good news? How many back-calls have you made in the last month?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> If these willing listeners are ever to get a firm spiritual foundation and become disciples, someone who has the truth will have to spend time with them. Paul said</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This June there were 10,248 more publishers than we had last year, an increase of 3.4 percent, and at the same time congregation publishers had higher averages for hours, magazines and back-cal Is. Additionally, we saw 2.025 more vacation pioneers reporting than last June and almost equaled the peak of regular pioneers. During June 1,630 were reported immersed, and the assemblies now under way will produce even more new ministers. All of this is very encouraging and we are thankful to Jehovah for his rich blessings in our ministry.</span></p>

Lunches can be packed and plans made, thus there can be some very pleasant association in the service and taking material food together in the countryside. Each one in the family can be a good influence on the others for keeping good habits, having some part in the Kingdom service each month and making certain to send in his report to the congregation. We hope this will be the best August we have ever had in the United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Here is a little news about the Gilead graduation program of September 10. Imagine our joy at seeing 102 students from 11 lands receive assignments to 34 different countries! After five months of training their chosen goal was now just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A delightful part of the program was a stage presentation of the circumstances facing God’s people in the days of Judge Jephthah, and their fulfillment in our day. it riveted the attention of a capacity audience, and ‘respect for Jehovah’s organization’ was deeply impressed upon all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Knorr concluded the morning program with very appropriate remarks to the student body of this 44th class, on the subject &quot;Having Something Others Do Not Have&quot;—the willingness to make missionary service their career, their special training and their foreign assignments. He urged them to use this unique ‘possession’ effectively to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For thOse of us who were present, there was special satisfaction in seeing those 102 vigorous young worshipers of God receive assignments to serve in distant lands with evident eagerness. They are willing to leave families and friends to share anywhere in Jehovah’s service! Surely Jehovah will richly bless them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theirs is a privilege thus far shared by only 4,464 publishers— comparatively, only a few. However, there may yet be time. Have you given serious thought to the missionary service as a career? Many of you young people could set your sights on that goal and work to attain it. You could vacation pioneer, then later apply for a regular pioneer appointment, and do all possible to qualify for an invitation to Gilead. Those who, for some reason, cannot go abroad can help fill the continuing need for vacation and regular pioneers right here in the United States. And all of us can keep</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Finest Work on Earth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It is a real pleasure to have a part in the finest work done on earth today, the work Jehovah Is asking us to do in these “last days,&quot; isn’t it? All of us appreciate that there is little time left for this present system of things. In the remaining time it is our desire to share in the preaching work as fully as possible so as to help many more honest-hearted persons to escape from Babylon the Great.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During the last service year it was our privilege to help 18,582 more persons to become dedicated and baptized participants in this God-given work. Very fine, indeed. This certainly indicates that Jehovah is blessing our efforts to please him and that he is still drawing new ones into his organization. Yes. the door is still open for more to come in! To help them, we all need to share as fully as we can in this finest of all work, Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> This month we will be featuring a year’s subscription for the foremost magazine in its field. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">New subscribers will be given free three booklets. Publishers will remit 90c for new subscriptions. Many of us have found that it is just as easy to obtain two subscriptions as one, so we offer a subscription for both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> with six booklets, for $2. One of many publishers who offers the double subscription wrote: “I offered the double subscription and in the course of one month obtained 18 subscriptions.&quot; When householders get both magazines rather than one, there are many more times during the year when the arrival of another magazine encourages them to consider Bible truth. Why not try offering busy, now and in the months ahead, preaching release to Babylon’s captives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">the double subscription, especially where good interest is manifested on the part of the householder?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Many of us in our witnessing meet householders who manifest sincere interest and who say: ‘I would like the magazines, but I don’t have the money right now.’ One publisher writes us that he kept a record of such householders and, by calling back, obtained thirty-three subscriptions in one month. Another publisher tells us that he places the two current magazines for 10c, returns two weeks later with the current magazines and in this way has developed a tine magazine route. It is a good thought, isn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Also, don't you agree that magazine routes provide an excellent field for obtaining subscriptions? The people are familiar with the fine information contained in the magazines, and many, when invited to subscribe, are pleased to do so. One publisher informs us that 'thirty subscriptions were obtained in six weeks from magazine route calls.’ Why not think of the various ones on your route who are potential subscribers and make the subscription offer during the month?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> What other avenues are open to us for obtaining subscriptions during October? To list a few, there is our house-to-house work, which will yield many; we can offer the subscription to persons with whom we study, our relatives and friends, also those with whom we do business, and we can send gift subscriptions. Then, too, if we do not subscribe personally, it would be good for us to become subscribers, wouldn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">' Often in our house-to-house ministry and especially on the weekend children answer the door. Do we ask, “Is your mother home?” or do we first ask, &quot;Is your father home?” Since most of the time the woman </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments, including appropriate Announcements on page 3. Song 77.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Personal Letter to You</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each month when the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> arrives, it is the hope of the Society that you feel a personal letter has come to you from your brothers and fellow workers at headquarters. We try to make it practical, for we want to help you all that we can in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> There are many things that guide us here in determining what should be considered in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> We rejoice with you in the good efforts put forth in past months, while making suggestions for Improvement based on these reports and on trends that are developing, as reflected by observations from the field. We try to provide timely topics for sermons and to answer your more frequently asked questions in the “Question Box.” Campaigns and offers are suggested for good coverage of territory with the good news.

<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ A number of mimeographed letters are being circulated from unknown sources, supposedly quoting district servants, members of tne Bethel families, etc. If you hear a talk that you enjoy, it is only natural to tell close friends about it, but it is not wise to mimeograph your notes for general distribution. Some of the items currently being circulated are of a &quot;sensational” nature but not at all accurate. As for printed material, the Society provides this in abundance in its official publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Starting November 5 the new public talk for circuit servants will be &quot;Science, the Bible and Your Faith.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ Publishers of draft age, on July 1, 1967, the new Military Selective Service Act of 1967 became law.

As in many things we do, so in our ministry, too, there is more than one way to accomplish the desired results. That is why you find, for instance, several suggested ways of getting a Bible study started, or a variety of ways to give house-to-house presentations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The question arises sometimes as to what latitude overseers have in adjusting the suggested service meeting programs. Any part can be slanted to provide local application. Some parts are prepared with the needs of the majority of the congregations in mind, but in a certain area the suggestions may not apply directly. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial for the congregation to consider briefly what is being done in other congregations and then the remaining time could profitably be spent discussing local needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Occasionally, too, some adjustments are needed when the circuit servant comes, assemblies are held and special matters need to be discussed, such as the prospects</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">dence may be filed with the local board to be included in the file going to the appeal board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each publisher registered with the draft is cautioned that the law requires him to carry his registration card and his classification card at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of interest to all who are registered with the draft is the executive order of the President of the United States on May 3, 1967, extending the time within which to appeal a classification or to request a personal appearance from 10 to 30 days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1967 336,029 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN AUGUST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a grand conclusion to our 1967 service year: 315,638 publishers —13,317 more than last August! And, isn’t it good to see regular pioneers at 9,954, which is very near the 10,000 mark? Also, it is most pleasing to say many more are applying to serve as pioneers. Let’s all continue sharing fully in the finest work on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">for building a Kingdom Hall. Congregation servants are at liberty to make these changes according to the need, while endeavoring to avoid leaving out any parts of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> that would be of particular benefit to the congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> will be of more personal benefit to each of us if we make a habit of reviewing beforehand what will be considered at the coming service meeting. The material will be more meaningful and we will be able to participate in group discussion readily.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is suggested that congregations keep a file of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> in the ministry school library for ready reference. Individuals have found it helpful, too, to keep back issues for a while so as to review suggested sermons or other helpful points. We know that you appreciate the help </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> brings you each month, because your letters express your appreciation. We enjoy hearing from you and we take this opportunity to express our appreciation for your letters. May our personal letter in the form of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> continue to bring us closer together in the doing of our Father's will acceptably.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Ready</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember that thrilling Friday afternoon at the recent “Disciple-making” District Assembly? Recall what happened at approximately 4:35 that afternoon? How excited we were with the release of the timely and thoughtprovoking textbook </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </span><span class="font11">Probably you said to yourself, ‘I do hope we have the opportunity to work with that publication soon. It looks so appealing.’ Many of you have already placed copies with other persons, and you will be glad to know that in November we will all be offering it to the public from house to house on a contribution of 25c, or in combination with either the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book for 75c.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> May we recommend three things before that time? First, take some time to read this new book now. Its style is moving and absorbing and, after reading it, you will surely be enthusiastic about placing it. Second, overseers, be sure to order sufficient supplies. Third, start now to think of all the people with whom you want to place this book—and there will be many. Details regarding the November campaign will be given later, but we mention these few things now to whet your appetite. We hope they will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">When Minors Answer the Door</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Every now and again when we are engaged in the house-to-house ministry a minor answers the door and informs us, “My parents are not at home.” What should we do? Jesus took time in his ministry to talk with children. It was not simply that he liked children. He was interested in their salvation. (Matt. 19:13-15) The same is true of us today. Of course, it is usually best to be cautious about accepting a child’s invitation into the home, as some parents may object. But often it is appropriate to give a short witness to the minor at the door.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When a publisher encounters children, it has been effective to ask them if they are acquainted with the ‘Lord’s prayer’ or, if Catholic, the 'Our Father prayer.’ Most youngsters are acquainted with it and are pleased to repeat it. We can draw attention to the phrase ‘your will be done on earth’ and ask them if they know what conditions will be like here on earth under the Kingdom, and then use appropriate scriptures such as Revelation 21:3, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font11"> to explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> With young children, after a brief conversation, it is usually wise just to leave a handbill and call</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The Finest Work on Earth </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font11">of the house is contacted, and our desire is to give a witness to every occupant of the home, why not ask for the father first and, if iie is at home, take advantage of the opportunity to acquaint him with the fine work that Jehovah is having done on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> While every issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> is good, this month the October 8, 15 and 22 issues are all specially line. Each one deals with matters of vital concern. These magazines are deserving of more than usual distribution. It would be very fine if we were able to arrange to spend even more than the usual amount of time in magazine activity this month, so as to enjoy added pleasures in placing this faith-building Information In the hands of many others. By zealous service we can show that we really appreciate what a privilege it is to share in this, the finest work-on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">back when the parents are at home. On the return call you can mention the interesting discussion had with the child, commend his interest in the Bible and go on to express your purpose in calling. Even then, if the child is on hand and you can draw him into the conversation, you may find that it helps to hold the parents’ attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When older minors answer the door and the parents are not at home, use the opportunity to give a witness. Many youths are concerned about the future and what it holds for them. We might ask them what they think the future will be like and then, according to what they express, use the Bible to show them the wonderful future that God promises under the blessings of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> On completing the witness, you might ascertain from them if their parents permit them to choose their own reading material. If the answer is yes, there is no objection to presenting the magazines or even the regular offer. The same is true when they reply that their parents often take our literature. However, if they are not free to choose reading material, then, perhaps, a tract can be given to them or a handbill and they can be encouraged to read it and give it to their parents when they come home. We recognize that the parents are responsible for supervising their own children, so it is good to use discernment when it comes to leaving literature with minors. But, by using good judgment, s'oiue publishers have had wonderful experiences in bringing youngsters to a knowledge of the truth and, later, their parents with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Our new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your</span><span class="font11"> Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">In a Lamp to My Loot,”</span><span class="font11"> on page 79, tells us: &quot;Keep in mind... that there are usually a number of persons in each household, and by working the territory at different times or on different days you may be able to meet various members of the family. Recognizing that the message you carry means life to those who embrace it, be diligent to give everyone in your territory the opportunity to hear it.’’ Thus, as opportunity affords, let’s witness to the young folks too, just as Jesus did.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Question. (Sox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">• Is it necessary for all dedicated and baptized publishers to have their congregation servant sign the Record of Christian Baptism on page 220 of the new book ‘Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A written certificate is not what makes you a minister of God. If you are a dedicated and baptized Christian, you are an ordained minister whether you have a written statement that testifies to your baptism or not. It is God's appointment of you to preach the good news of the Kingdom, as recorded In the Bible, that constitutes your ordination. Living up to this responsibility is the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, it is good for us personally to have some written record of the elate of our baptism, because we need it at various times. So, if you have been immersed, we suggest that you fill in the spaces on page 220 of the book, calling for the place and date of your baptism, and then sign your name. There is no need for the congregation overseer to do this for each one who was baptized in years past. But, if possible, the brother in office when one was immersed should sign the certification. If you should ever need a written statement from your present overseer testifying that you are a baptized Witness, he will be glad to accommodate you when the need arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But In the future, after anyone has been immersed, the newly baptized person may take his personal copy of the book “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot” to his overseer and together they will fill In the Record of Christian Baptism and the overseer will endorse it. The overseer's signature affirms, not only that the individual has been baptized, but that he attended the entire series of meetings arranged to prepare candidates for immersion and that he really has a sufficient grasp of the basic teachings of the Bible to discharge the obligations of a baptized witness of Jehovah.</span></p>

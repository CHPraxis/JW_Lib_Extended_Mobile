<p><span class="font10">No doubt you have been awaiting word about the Society’s annual business meeting in Pittsburgh. Well, we had a grand time I On Sunday, October 1, the beautiful Civic Arena there was just filled to capacity by 11,793 brothers from all across the continent—Florida, California, Indiana, Kansas and Canada. Also, some 250 members of our Bethel family managed to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many brothers, of course, were there for the first time, and they were impressed by the fact that this business meeting, required by law, was In fact an occasion for spiritual refreshment. The three-hour program included reports on the progress of the Kingdom work in Peru, Japan and Israel—reports given by Society members just recently arrived from these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Specially enjoyed was the address of the chairman and vice-president, Brother Franz. He spoke on the subject “In All Nations the Good News Has to Be Preached First.” He made the distinction between the discipling that has always marked the work of Jesus' followers, and the preaching or heralding of “this good news of the Kingdom,” a work he described as “a startling feature of only this twentieth century.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Deeply appreciated, too, were greetings and experiences from around the world, read by the secretary-treasurer, Grant Suiter. It was like being at an international assembly, for we heard about preaching amid difficulties in war-torn Nigeria; construction of the large new branch office in Brazil; outstanding increase in the pioneer ranks in Korea and Japan; France's Memorial attendance of 41,274, and the joy of 800 Yugoslavians who attended an assembly in Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, brothers, in harmony with the Society’s chartered purpose, let’s go on heralding the Kingdom message, discipling willing listeners, and building godly personalities on the right foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">A Time to Build</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When we think about our work for November, we are reminded of what the congregator says: “For everything there is an appointed time, ... a time to break down and a time to build.” (Eccl. 3:1-3) November really is a special time to break down the faith-shattering, morals-disintegrat-ing theory of evolution in the minds of all honest persons. And we have just the instrument to do this in our new publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Did, Man Get Here</span><span class="font10"> fey </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font10"> Yes, it is a time to break down these false teachings, but also it is a time to build up faith in Jehovah, in his written Word, and in his organization. What a blessing it will be to take this liberating instrument to the people!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Who will be interested in this new book? What about those with whom we placed the April 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> “Evolution or Creation by God—Which?” There were educators, physicians, dentists, lawyers, architects, engineers and many others. Frankly, brothers, it would be good to call back on all who showed even a spark of interest in this issue, and when you call you could say something like this: “Did you enjoy the articles on evolution? Well, when we went to our convention this summer, an entire publication on this subject was released and I couldn’t help but think of you when I began to read this new book. I’m sure you would enjoy it very much. It’s placed on a contribution of only 25c.” Remember, too, brothers, every one of these return calls should be reported as a back-call, if you contact the person with whom you placed the magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> And you young folks, remember all the contacts you made during April and May with your schoolteachers and fellow students? Wouldn’t it be splendid to offer them this new publication? We believe that many of them will thank you for offering it to them. Yes, school principals, science teachers, other educators and students are just a few of those to whom we can make the offer of this exciting publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In showing the book to teachers, for example, why not open it to the Table of Contents and whet their appetites, so to speak? Then you could refer them to pages 187-191, where they will observe 248 up-to-date references that amply document the points made in this publication. This alone will be an eye-opener for many.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> And the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book is so well illustrated. Isn’t it? Pictures are often more persuasive than words. Use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">°If some householders are not interested in the subject of evolution, we can show them the section of the book dealing with the permission of wickedness. This is such an absorbing and faith-building subject too. Who is responsible for man’s wickedness? Why has wickedness been permitted for so long? How much longer will it be tolerated? Is there a sound hope of a marvelous future? Notice that the material in this part of the book, too, is well documented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Truly each one of us should be very enthusiastic about placing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book with as many people as we possibly can during the month of November. You may present it, with a booklet, for a contribution of 25c. But where exceptional interest is shown, why not suggest they take one for themselves and several for their friends? Likely many will contribute a dollar for four books. A brother who tried this in house-to-house work here in Brooklyn placed 12 books in an hour and twenty minutes one evening. Of course, if you choose to place it in combination with either of the two latest bound books for. 75c, that would be fine. But whatever we do, all of us should work hard at our building effort, to make November an outstanding month to Jehovah's praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Improving the Quality of Our Ministry. Song 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: &quot;Your Word Is,a Lamp to My Foot.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In preparation read pages 70-84 of the book, looking up scriptures and noting points that answer questions below. The one in charge should know the material well to be sure information is covered thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Your Field Ministry&quot;: How did Jesus carry on his ministry? What work did he outline for us? Explain your ordination as a minister of God. How can we find time to share fully in the field ministry? (Read p. 72, par. 1.) When we tend to feel inadequate as ministers, it is good to remember that what else is of far greater importance than our natural ability? Ip what ways is good accomplished by our ministry even when it is difficult to place literature and when people do not show Interest? Why is it beneficial to call again at the homes even if the people were indifferent or unfriendly previously? How do Bible examples help us to know what we ought to do about meetings and service when being persecuted? To what extent should we individually participate in the ministry, and why? (Read p. 76, par. 2 and p. 77, par. 1.) (Territory in Which to Preach) How may you obtain a personal assignment of territory in which to preach? Why is frequent coverage of territory beneficial? Give some suggestions to assure thorough coverage of a territory. (Group Witnessing) When do groups meet for service, and how are these times determined? At what time is it proper to begin calling at homes in the morning? Why is it beneficial to attend the meeting for service before going out into the territory? Offer some practical suggestions on assigning territory in group witnessing so that the most service is accomplished. What provisions are made for the personal training of publishers in the field service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the first steps in preparing those with whom we conduct Bible studies to share in service is to aid them to attend the congregation meetings. We do not invite others to become Kingdom publishers unless they are attending meetings, if they physically and circumstantially are able to do so. Some readily come; with others, this is a major problem. After a few attempts on our part, what can we do when householders fail to respond?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two publishers discuss together how to aid newly interested ones to get to meetings. See &quot;Qualified to Be Ministers,&quot; pp. 215-218; also Nov. 1, 1967, &quot;Watchtower,” pp. 668-670.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ask audience for suggestions. Inquire as to what it was that moved publishers now present at meeting to start attending congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage all who are conducting studies to try these suggestions within next week or two. This Is something that needs to be done whether studies are very new or well established. 15 min: &quot;A Time to Build.&quot; Audience participation and demonstration of pars. 2 and 4. Discuss local arrangements to make personal follow-up calls on those who received April 22 “Awake!” to offer new “Evolution” book. Plan this carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts report, also encouragement for all to study ahead each week for participation in discussion of “Your Word Is a Lamp” in order to benefit from it most fully. Song 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Building on the Right Foundation. Song 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Handling of branch letter along with text and introduction to meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In preparation read pp. 85-103 (par. 1). Cover with audience participation, using questions below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Preaching from House to House) Why do we preach from house to house?aWhat two things is it appropriate for us to make prominent when we preach to people?<sup>1</sup> Give illustrations of ways in which flexibility in our presentation plight help us to find hearing ears. How long should we talk at any one doo£?/How is it determined what literature we. offer people?. Why do we keep a House-to-House Record? (Back-Calls) Why is house-to-house work by itself not sufficient to carry out our commission as teachers?. On whom should we make return calls? How soon is it beneficial to make a back-call?/What may we discuss with people when we make back-calls? Why is patience required in the back-call work?-Why is regularity in this activity important? (Home Bible Studies) How do those who conduct home Bible studies feel about that feature of service? How can studies be started? In what publication should the study be conducted? What suggestions are offered on how to conduct a study? Offer practical suggestions (pp. 95, 96) on how to build with fire-resistant, materials when conducting a study. What can be done progressively td build the student’s appreciation for Jehovah’s organization? What is the purpose of the study, and how can you tactfully achieve it? Who qualifies to conduct a home Bible study, and why so? (Magazine Distribution) How does magazine distribution accomplish much good? In what ways are both “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” beneficial to the public? When may we engage in this feature of service, and what type of presentation is suggested? Why is it beneficial to call back on those who obtain magazines? (Other Witnessing) What other opportunities are there to talk to people about God’s Word? How does the Bible point to the benefit that comes from witnessing to one’s relatives? Offer some suggestions on how to witness to people we meet in our daily activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “How Important Is Good Association to You?” Sept. 15, 1967, &quot;Watchtower,” pp. 572-575.</span></p>

Ill), how the Society compiles the report for the country and for the world (pp. 112, 113), and why we put forth special effort during certain months (emphasize it for December) to aid new’ ones to start in service (pp. 113, 114).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">32 min: Report for 1967 Service Year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Animated family discussion on “An Excellent Report!&quot; in &quot;Kingdom Ministry&quot; insert. Father takes the lead and guides conversation. Didn’t think he had such a good year, but when we see what was done by all of Jehovah’s people, the report is truly excellent. Each family member contributes to lively discussion.

<p><span class="font9">8 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God. (Invitation to meetings)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Select man and wife as persons with whom home Bible study is being conducted, and publisher who conducts the study. It would be fine to use the (Confinued </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">on page</span><span class="font9"> 7, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>REPORT FOR THE 1967 SERVICE YEAR</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>An Excellent Report!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brothers, you will recall how Moses, at the threshold of the Promised Land, recounted the marvelous things that God had done in directing and protecting his people. His words were so upbuilding as he urged fellow Israelites to hold to Jehovah their God for future success. (Deut. 7:12-16) Can we not also gain benefit from reviewing the evidences of God’s blessing upon us during the progress of the 1967 service year? Surely we can!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The report is indeed a cause for rejoicing, for it shows that you have been working hard at ‘making disciples of people.’ For example, the average number of publishers here in the fortyeight adjoining states of the United States showed an increase of about 2 percent, from 305,481 to 311,378. This was twice the increase we had in the previous year. And our April peak of 328,648 was another cause for rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Proof of your disciple-making is to be noted in the number baptized during the year—18,582. That represents a lot of teaching! If we view this in terms of a town, 5,000 persons would represent a fair-sized town, and here we have almost four of such towns, people now in the truth, in line for everlasting life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, it was the Bible studies that helped us to lead sincere persons to the step of dedication. There were, on an average, 247,957 Bible studies reported each month during the year, and the report indicates that you conducted a total of over 14,000 more Bible studies than in 1966. This is really very fine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As to back-calls, congregation publishers aver-' aged 3.6, and pioneers 28.5. Our grand total of return visits on people who are not Jehovah’s witnesses wns 18,309,703. Just think what a tremendous amount of good all these calls did! And many of the calls involved extra time preparing for discussions or to answer questions. Also, as you well know, repeated calls were frequently required to find some of these people at home. So you have actually expended much more time and effort than appear on the report. Fine work, brothers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another commendable feature was the average hours of the congregation publishers—9.6. Do you realize this means that, on the average, each of you devoted about 115 hours to teaching and preaching during the year? This is a great deal of time, considering all the things you have to do at home and in secular w’ork. Satisfying, is it not, to know that so much time has been given to Jehovah’s praise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The year was outstanding for pioneer activity, an all-time peak of 9,954 pioneers having been reached in August. In potential, their work equals that of almost 100,000 ten-hour publishers! Our monthly average of regular and vacation pioneers was 15,315, up almost 1,000 a month over last year. And vacation pioneer opportunities continue to receive excellent attention. It show’s a keen desire on the part of you brothers to grasp opportunities as you can, even when you have family and other responsibilities. It may well be that one out of ten publishers shared in vacation pioneer service during the 1967 service year. And this has contributed immeasurably to the maturity of many congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The subscription report is also cause for rejoicing. Together, we obtained 1,061,110, an increase of 183,467 new subscriptions over the 1966 report, or a 20.9-percent increase. Isn’t it gratifying to know that now, of every issue, about 785,000 copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and 600,000 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines are being mailed to home addresses in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And as to individual copies of the magazines —you placed a total of 59,999,928! Besides that, 6,179,567 books and booklets were distributed. When we reflect on the fact that there are about 58,000,000 households in the United States, this means that, on the average, each household received more than one piece of literature explaining the Bible’s message of liberation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Often, of course, we do not place anything. Nevertheless, our very presence at the door can have good results. In one Italian Catholic area of Brooklyn w’here publishers seldom have the opportunity to give a sermon, a woman told a circuit servant’s wife: “It gives me great courage th see you people come to the doors.” Yes, our calls have an impact on people whether there is any immediate response or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young publishers, too, have done much toward making this a good annual report. One lady in Virginia, for instance, told a circuit servant of her observations, she having lived in many different parts of the world: “You know, the thing that’s impressed me about you people is the way you train your children. No matter where we’ve lived, we haven’t been there long before some of the Witness children called with your magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You elderly and infirm publishers also have contributed to our excellent report. This you have done, in many instances, by letter writing. For example, one elderly sister in Iowa wrote about the Kingdom to all her children and others she knew. Result? A total of 26 subscriptions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another powerful factor in the witness given during the past year has been the Society’s films, “Heritage” and “God Cannot Lie.” There have been many private showings. At one of these showings of “Heritage” to a church group, a high school principal said he “would endorse the showing of this film in every church, school and social group concerned with the welfare of youth.” A multitude of people have seen “Heritage” by reason of the 194 TV showings since June 1966. One young man who viewed it on TV had planned to enter college that day. He changed his mind and is now studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Films, public talks and literature have all been widely advertised by leaflets (140,958,600 of them were printed for your use). These have been effectively used in the field. Sometimes a person may incline to discount the value of this form of advertising the Kingdom. Well, one leaflet announcing the “God Cannot Lie” film brought a man to a circuit assembly for three days, with the result that a Bible study was started in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is so much more we would like to tell you about the year’s report! For instance, about territory coverage. Briefly, it is estimated that, on an average, both city and rural territory throughout the country was covered about once in six months this past year. But, of course, it varies. Some city territories are covered often. One congregation in Florida, in fact, covered its territory 26 times in six months! But sheeplike ones are still being located. All in all, brothers, the report shows encouraging progress in the work of making disciples. Keep it up!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Our </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Best Coverage of Unassigned Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to the fine effort you put forth in regularly assigned territory, a grand witness was also given this past year in unassigned areas of the country. Responding to the reminder in last May’s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> about the many unassigned areas not worked for two or three years, hundreds of letters poured into the Society’s office requesting assignments to care for these areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society invited special pioneers to participate in the campaign. Also, regular pioneers willing to spend 150 or more hours in such service each month were given some financial assistance under a special arrangement. So, many special and regular pioneer teams moved out into isolated districts and managed to contact thousands of persons who otherwise would not have heard the good news this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Truly the foretold willing spirit of God’s people contributed immeasurably to the unprecedented success of the 1967 unassigned territory campaign. (Ps. 110:3) All told, there were 568 congregations, besides pioneers and others, that requested and looked after unassigned territories this year. By this concerted effort it was possible to cover all but 58 of the counties or parts of counties available. This is the best coverage of unassigned territory in the United States to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider the progress that has been made since 1960. That year we started off with 941 unassigned counties or parts of counties. By the close of the service year 564 of these had still not been worked that summer. However, in 1962 only 91 unassigned territories remained unworked at the end of the campaign. This year only 58 were not cared for by any congregation or pioneer, and you’ll be glad to know that only 6 of the 58 unworked counties are completely unassigned, with no one doing any witnessing anywhere in the entire county. So, throughout the United States only 6 out of a total of 3,069 counties remained completely unworked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And on closer scrutiny we find that only a relatively small portion of the total population that is the responsibility of the United States branch remained without contact by you Kingdom publishers during the past year. Of the estimated three million people living in our total unassigned territory, less than 100,000 live in territory not assigned during the year, and most of them have been called on at some time in the past. Surely the good news is being spread!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is not possible as yet to assign all the territory to congregations. In most cases, congregations near unassigned territory do not have many publishers and already have an extensive area to cover in their regular assignment. Then there is the great area of some unassigned territories in comparison to the number of people living within them. For example, let’s take two counties in Texas, Hudspeth and Culberson. These counties have a combined estimated unassigned population of about 6,000 persons. That does not sound like so many people, does it? However, they are difficult to reach because the unassigned territory in these two counties covers roughly the same areas as the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware! Thus it takes an expenditure of much time and money to reach the isolated persons in these areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But how different the response in unassigned territory from that often encountered in our home fishing grounds! Here is a report from one congregation sharing in unassigned territory activity in Alabama: “There is something different about the rurals and small communities. In general people are more ready to receive one and show hospitality. This gives us the opportunity to talk about the Kingdom. In cities people are quicker to turn strangers away before hearing what they have to say.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Wouldn’t you enjoy working territory such as that described in this interesting report? ‘Teople are very friendly and many invite us in for refreshments or a meal. Almost all had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and are very interested in people who are •willing to make free visits to preach the good news. It is often difficult to depart, since people are eager to discuss the Bible. At the end of the day, as we drive back through the territory, we note the friendly waves of those with whom we have talked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here are other experiences not at all uncommon in unassigned territory: “We have been able to organize a book study and have had 21 different persons in attendance. With the assistance of five others, one Saturday and Sunday we were able to obtain 27 subscriptions and place 352 magazines. Once my wife made six consecutive calls and obtained 12 subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A group of publishers traveled 250 miles one way to reach unassigned territory. Reporting on the rich blessings they enjoyed, they wrote: “We found that average placements are from 3 to 6 books, 30 to 50 magazines, and 1 or 2 subscriptions per day. This is most encouraging. Discussions in depth are usual and many studies have been started on the initial call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Yes, brothers, you have been giving a mighty witness in all areas of the country. As a result of your fine efforts, 13 congregations have been formed from isolated groups this past service year. How wonderful! Truly, Jehovah has richly blessed our united efforts to make disciples in unassigned territory!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Assemblies Built Us Up, Gave Wide Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Didn’t we have fine assemblies this past service year too? What a stimulus to our disciple-making efforts and what an excellent witness! You will be happy to learn that, besides the “Disciplemaking” District Assemblies in 45 different cities, we also conducted circuit assemblies in more than 475 locations in 48 states. Many of those circuit assemblies as well as 12 of the district assemblies were held in towns and cities never before used for such assemblies. By supporting the assemblies you shared in giving a fine witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society seeks to give the greatest witness by making special selection of assembly cities. For example, the 30 to 40 district assemblies now being arranged for 1968 will, it is hoped, be held in cities not used in 1966 and 1967. In fact, many of the places will be those not used for eight to ten years. If all of our arrangements work out, we shall have district assemblies in ten cities not used in the last twenty years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another most encouraging feature, brothers, is the far-reaching effect of your fine Christian conduct observed at assemblies during the past year. A high school principal in Washington, for example, wrote the circuit servant: “I can most honestly say that you left our facilities in much better condition than you found them.... I think we all learned a great deal from you. ... I find myself somewhat awed' by the respect I have for you people.”. And the business manager of an Ohio school district wrote: “Our district hat is off to you folks. Your complete organization and handling of those thousands of people won the admiration of our district employees and weekend visitors. The behavior of the children, the courtesy in the cafeteria, parking lot and building in general were noted by all of us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Isn’t it happifying to know that your conduct has been observed with appreciation? Think, too, of the fine witness given by the circuit assembly programs and all related publicity! At Brookings, S.D., for instance, there were 25 spot radio announcements. At Ipswich, Mass., the radio station carried the public address. At Mascoutah, Ill., despite the groups protesting our use of the school auditorium, the high school board listened carefully to representations made by our brothers and then determined to hold to their contract. Said the circuit servant: “The whole incident proved to be a good witness. As our brothers covered the surrounding territory they received a friendly reception and many favorable comments were heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another point. Do you notice that people are still talking about the Society’s films “God Cannot Lie” and “Heritage,” used at our circuit assemblies? Remember how one assembly program was built around the “Heritage” film, encouraging families to do things together? Have you put those suggestions into effect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recall, too, the excellent circuit assembly program developing the theme “Adding to Our Faith Endurance.” It was fine to be reminded of the importance of giving children reasons from the Bible, not just rules. Then there was the demonstration of help given to the “Zeal-out” family. Tactfully the servants explained that their call on the family was not with field service in mind, but to aid in the solution of the family’s spiritual problems. The aim was to help the family get down to regular family study and meeting attendance. And, brothers, do you remember the point about greeting those who resume attending meetings? Don’t discourage them by telling them it’s such a long time since you last saw them. Have you practiced showing warm interest in their spirituality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The last part of that program, you recall, came right home to us individually, with analysis of four spheres of activity: Personal and family study, guarding against encroachment on our time by too much TV viewing; our meeting attendance, making sure we are there in mind as well as physically; then the matter of predetermining our service-in-the-field times and sticking to them, rather than sharing in the ministry in a haphazard way; finally, there was our recreation. How do we use these occasions for relaxation? What do we talk about? Do we use such opportunities to speak about spiritual matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No doubt about it, our circuit assemblies surely helped us all to improve our spirituality. Not only that, but think of the grand witness they gave in so many towns and cities! And all of us who attended have been much better equipped for effective participation in the discipling work to be done in the coming months. Let it be our firm resolve, brothers, to use our improved spirituality for the blessing of our fellowmen and the praise of the generous God who made all these assembly benefits possible.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Education for Everlasting Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Assemblies are high points of the year’s experiences, but throughout the year Jehovah provides education for life in the new system of things—our weekly meetings! Our congregational study of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book is a fine example. Didn’t you enjoy those chapters on the antitypical Jubilee, various baptisms, and marriage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Theocratic Ministry School we listened to more than 200 excellent talks. Wasn’t it good to have all these reminders of God’s way of thinking? And how wonderfully service meeting programs equipped us for better service in the field! Too, our public meeting program was enlivened by so many brand-new topics, presented in such a variety of ways! Just think how much we all have learned at those meetings. We didn’t want to miss a single one of those educational sessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Vitally necessary to us for incitement of one another to love and fine works were the weekly </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> studies. Recall how practical were some of those topics we discussed: “Building on a Right Foundation with Fire-resistant Materials,” “Making Grateful Use of a ‘Penny,’ ” “Festivals of Praise to Jehovah,” and “Keeping Free from the Spirit of Complaint.” Coidd we safely have missed this life-giving education? Assuredly not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That we did appreciate these generous provisions from our God' can be noted by the increase in average attendance for all congregation meetings. Attendance at the Theocratic Ministry School rose from 70.9 to 76.1, while that for the weekly book study jumped from 78.9 to 82.8 percent. About 5 percent more attended the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and the service meeting, figures for which now stand at 84.7 and 75.4 percent respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So, brothers, go on making this fine progress. Regular attendance at all meetings is improving the quality of our God-given discipling work.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How thankful we are to Jehovah for the training he offers us in the Theocratic Ministry School! He has taken farmers and fishermen, factory workers and housewives, and through his organization he has trained us to be qualified ministers. Truly, we do appreciate the fine provisions he constantly makes for our care, including the recently revised publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers. </span><span class="font10">Are you making good use of it when you prepare your student talks? We hope so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One big question that always comes up when preparing a student talk is. What setting should I use? Sometimes we have our householder all primed to ask a question that no one has ever asked us in all the years that we have been in the ministry. That’s not very practical, is it? Of course, the one researching the material gets the benefit of such research and we all enjoy hearing him discuss it. But how much more interesting and helpful It would be If the setting showed us how we might really use the Information. In this way we would be making our assignments live, wouldn’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our school instructions say that for talks numbers three and four one assistant is assigned by the school servant, but others may also be used. In some instances, the situation can</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">same ones for the entire series of demonstrations that will be held twice a month from now through March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman briefly reminds audience that we all are making special effort to encourage those with whom we study to attend meetings. Suggest that, if they have already tried several times to build up interest in meetings, they may want to take along another publisher to let that publisher help to stimulate Interest in meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstrate: Two publishers arrive at home for study; introductions made. Visiting publisher says that he (or she) has heard about how well they are doing in their study of the Bible. Get ready to start study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman interrupts, suggests that we see what happens at conclusion of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstrate: Publisher conducting study mentions that both of them attend meetings at Kingdom Hall together. Other publisher promptly follows through with enthusiastic comments about public talk and &quot;Watchtower&quot; study; explains that new at-tenders are not called on to comment unless they volunteer; invites newly interested couple to attend meeting with them that week. Arrange to pick them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: If those with whom you are studying are not yet attending meetings, why not try this suggestion within the next week or two?</span></p>

For example, often when we conduct a study, it is with a husband and a wife or with a mother and a child. We may do that in the school too. Or it may be that, when you are making a back-call, a neighbor comes in and tries to disrupt things by asking somewhat hostile questions. We have to cope with the situation so that the progress of the householder is not hindered. These things really happen. And it is what really happens that we want to use. If we keep in mind that true religion is a way of life, that it influences everything we do, then we will remember that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">our settings may be taken from anything we do in life. If</span><span class="font10"> the material we are discussing is really something that we would use from house to house or on a back-call, fine. It is good to use such a setting. But if not, then it may be useful to have another setting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For example, your material might be something that would help two people settle an argument. Possibly your setting could be right at home, helping two children when they get Into a quarrel.

<p><span class="font9">Chairman comments very briefly that servant body is made up of mature Christians and all of them have assignments to be of help to us. We are going to get better acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Call them to the front, one at a time. Some may be called on simply to state to the congregation what they do as servants. Others may be Interviewed with a series of questions. Emphasis should be on the ways they serve their brothers in the congregation; records may be discussed to some extent, but highlight their value to the congregation. Draw comments largely from Information in the book, on pp. 124-132, 135-152 (par. 1). Call on one congregation book study servant to speak for them all. Ask one public speaker to represent all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If there are any servants’ positions not currently filled by brothers, but sisters are helping to care for the work, explain that. (See p. 120, par. 1.) The sisters may be asked to explain from their seats what work they are doing to assist in caring for congregation Interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Paving the Way for Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Recently one of the brothers here at Bethel took a group of college students on a tour of the Service Office. Most of them already knew of our house-to-house activity, but, before conducting the tour, this brother wanted to be sure they fully understood the real purpose of our ministry and so he told them: “The primary work of Jehovah’s witnesses is to teach Bible truths. For this reason we conduct personal Bible studies with those whom we find interested in God’s Word.” Now that they knew the objective of our ministry, the tour resulted in an increased appreciation for the motive behind our work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What this brother said is true. The Bible study work is the foremost means by which persons are aided to learn of Jehovah’s purposes. When we place literature with interested persons it is usually beneficial to tell them about this home Bible study service. Even if you have difficulty in starting studies, you may already have a fine source of Bible studies without even realizing it. To what do we refer? Magazine routes! Have you told those to whom you deliver magazines that you would like to conduct a regular home Bible study with them? When you call back on your magazine placements week after week, a warm, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Our Assignments Uva </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Coat’d) </span><span class="font10">nity to do some incidental witnessing; that might be a very useful and practical setting. Or, we might suggest a conversation in the waiting room at the doctor’s office. Or, perhaps explaining to a schoolteacher why our children do not share in holiday celebrations. In other words, settings may be taken from anything we do in life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> We might also say a word about our settings for the final student talk. Here, too, the setting should be realistic. If the subject is the type that a young publisher might be able to use as a talk in school, that would be fitting. We have heard that one brother gave a talk as if it were his defense of his ministerial status before the draft board. Some of our brothers who have refused to join in picketing when the union friendly relationship is built up with the householder. As you discuss various articles together, you can’t help but learn something about his interests and views on the issues of the day. How beneficial this knowledge and friendly relationship are in selecting topics for study that will be most appealing. Truly, magazine routes provide an excellent foundation for starting Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> After a few calls you might place a booklet when delivering the magazines. Or, if you prefer, you might point to one of the articles with the study questions in the first issue of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> each month. If you know of something in the publications that would be of particular Interest to the householder, you can ask a question on that point and show how the literature readily provides the Bible’s answer. Look up the scriptures together. If it seems appropriate, consider several paragraphs. Before leaving, review with the householder what he has learned and arrange to discuss the next few paragraphs the following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* By using magazine routes to pave the way for Bible studies it has been possible to start studies without difficulty in territory where there is indifference or even prejudice. By keeping your objective in view when placing magazines, we believe that you too will find the door open to many fine Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">went out on strike have had the opportunity to explain their position before union members, and as a result no fine Vas imposed upon them. This could be used for a setting for scriptures on Christian neutrality. And there is also the setting of a service talk. It usually is appropriate when the others are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If any of you have difficulty in selecting a setting, you should never hesitate to ask your brothers for ideas. After all, we enjoy doing things together. It is hoped that some of these suggestions for settings will help us to make our talks more alive, more informative and more practical. Remember, the basic principle Is, true religion influences everything we do. So our settings may be taken from anything we do in life. Brothers, let’s work to make our assignments live!</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Question £o<sub>X</sub></span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• What inay be reported as time spent in the field service?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">This question is answered in the new book &quot;Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot,&quot; on pages 104, 105. There you will notice that it says time to be reported is from when you personally make your first call In the territory until you leave your last call, and this is true whether anyone is at home or not. So your report may differ from that of others in your group. The best thing to do is to plan your work so that everyone in the group can keep busy for the full time set aside for</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is also stated that, if two publishers work together, both may count the time, as long as both share in giving the witness. In most cases no more than two are needed to handle any call. But if. for some reason, more than two publishers go to the same home Bible study, as, for example, if parents take a child with them, just two are to count service time, and these should be the ones who actually share in giving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the other hand, there is much time that may be counted as service that some may overlook. For example, do you count time spent'in incidental witnessing? in writing letters to give a witness? in conducting a Bible study with your unbaptized children? in calling newly interested persons on the phone to get them to meetings? in calling at the home of an unbaptized publisher to take him along in service or in helping him to learn a sermon to use in the service? You may. In fact, any time that you spend in helping persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah to learn about God’s Word and his organization may be counted in your report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even among those who got baptized in the past there may be some who need special help. Perhaps they seldom come to meetings and miss sharing in the service for entire months at a time. They need help, don’t they? Tf you can arrange to conduct a Bible study with them, it might help to build them up. and that may be included in your report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We appreciate your turning in your service reports; they are a source of encouragement to all of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL, 1967</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA “Here I ami Send me.”—Isa. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. X NO. 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">My dear Brothers and Sisters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isn’t it good to have spring back with us again? It has been a difficult winter in most parts of the United States, but winter to us means summer to our brothers and sisters in the southern hemisphere. You know', some of those countries in Latin America have had new' peaks in publishers, and some have reached 10-percent increases even though they had conventions to care for. Usually a convention month pulls down the number of publishers who share in the ministry. I was just checking over the reports for the 21 countries where we had conventions during December and January. During the 1966 service year we had 116,586, on the average, throughout the 21 lands. In December In these same countries we had 121,751 publishers in the Held, and in January there were 122,875 preaching the good news of tlie Kingdom. So they did very well, didn’t they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, the best month for those countries is April, just as it is here in North America and elsewhere. So we are looking forward to April’s activity. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> am just wondering, have all of us thought of what we can do this April as compared with last April? Or what we can do tills April as compared with March? Can we do better? Can congregation publishers add, say, five more hours to their field service report during April than they did in March? This would make April outstanding, something special. Is it possible that we might make more back-calls, get another Bible study started? Could we really put forth an extraordinary effort to take someone else out in the field service that we know has not been out for a while? Would not April be a good month to start those people in the field ministry who have been studying with us for six months or a year and who attend meetings and qualify? Now that it is still early in the month, let’s do our planning to make this our best April ever in every way we can.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Be a True Companion</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “A true companion is loving . . (Prov. 17:17) He is one who can give help when it is needed. Such true companions were never more greatly needed than in these critical times in which we are living. Their help Is essential in building up others spiritually and aiding them to keep active in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Think how needed true companions are. In April we are seeking a 20-pereent increase in publishers—366,577 is the exact figure. The only way we can reach such a fine figure is by outstanding activity in the congregations throughout the country. It calls for each one to be active In the ministry and to give practical aid to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Whom can you lovingly assist? One large group is made up of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">We have had an exciting month of March here at Bethel with the graduation of the 43rd class of Gilead, and we have been saying good-bye to many of the missionaries who are going off into these distant lands. Also, here in the Brooklyn office we get subscriptions from all over the world. Many brothers send them here because we print their language, and we are very pleased to know' that, at: the end of February, we were 68,000 subscriptions ahead of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-tower</span><span class="font8"> campaign of 1966. It looks as though the 1967 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">campaign will be better than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By Jehovah’s tindeserved kindness let us make April an extraordinary month in the life of each one of us as far as preaching the good news is concerned; and let us continue to pray for Jehovah’s rich blessing to be upon our brothers around the world as, together, we, &quot;by teaching, make disciples of Christ.” What a glorious treasure we have!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother, children of dedicated parents. Thousands of these have published. Perhaps all they will need to publish in April is encouragement and companionship. There may be many youngsters who are now willing and ready to share in service for the first time. If so, could you parents aid them to develop a magazine presentation or a simple sermon they might use?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> How about those with whom you are studying and who have been making good progress? Are such ones attending meetings? Are they now Scripturally and morally qualified to be extended an invitation to share In the service? If so, and if you have not already suggested this, why not talk it over at your next study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Since extensive efforts have been put forth to study with those who have been inactive, there may be many such ones who are now attending meetings and would be happy to get started in the service again. Perhaps you know of such a one that you could invite to accompany you as you engage in the discipling work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Of course, the first one to get In the service in April is oneself. We may be the ones who need encouragement. If so, we want to remember what a privilege it is to act for Jehovah as a teacher making disciples.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> With all this talk about true companions, we do not want to forget the servants, study conductors and other mature publishers who are doing such a wonderful job of helping others all the time. They will be especially busy this month working for the 20-percent increase, and we feel confident that their fine efforts to aid others will be deeply appreciated by all, whether weak or strong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> As all work together unitedly as companions, we can look forward to reaching a grand new peak of publishers in April.</span></p>

[Read] How can a person rejoice when wickedness, wars and troubles among mankind are worse than ever before? Because these prove we are in the last days of this system of things. It means a great change is at hand. It is the apostle Peter who tells us what will happen when these days come to their end, here in 2 Peter 3:13. [Read] Can’t you see now why this is a most marvelous and favored time to be living? While a big change is at hand, we can enjoy the righteous benefits of this new system if we follow the counsel in the next verse: 'Beloved ones, since we are awaiting these things, do your utmost . . . ’ This Bible-study aid will show you where you may find further information from God’s Word on this promised new order.” Chairman then will encourage prompt return visits on placements to start studies or suggest that some may wish to invite householder to study the Bible and then use sermon, depending on response of householder. 10 min: Experiences of young publishers and others in placing special April 22 &quot;Awake!” with teachers.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN FEBRUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Best ever! That’s the February report of new subscriptions obtained. The exact number is 138,726, or 26,334 more than last February. This is certainly excellent, especially since February is a short month and there was much stormy, cold weather. It appears that the suggestions to offer subscriptions to relatives and to those with whom we study have been blessed with fine success. Gift subscriptions also have been received in large numbers. If the trend continues in the last two months, the entire campaign will be the best ever!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the Teachers Hear!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Brothers, there is an important work that we would like to do in April that needs your special attention right away. Because the April 22 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> on “Evolution or Creation—Which?” is especially appropriate for educators, we suggest that each congregation put forth a diligent effort to see that teachers in their territory receive personal copies. The special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> will appeal to teachers because it presents scientific fact and is well documented. It is frank in showing that evolution is based upon popular misconceptions, that It is not supported by facts of science and that it undermines faith in God and weakens the morals of those who accept it. The special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> may help teachers individually, not only to break free from belief in evolution, but to learn the Bible’s truth 1 Here is an assignment well worth special time and effort.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> You young publishers in school will want to offer the teachers you know a copy of the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">Why not present it personally at an appropriate time and in a friendly way? Even if you do not personally know all the teachers in your school, you can still present them with copies. If it is not convenient to approach them personally, then sit down and write a brief, friendly note introducing yourself and the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> Sign the note and leave it with the magazine for the teacher. Where there is more than one Witness in a classroom, determine among yourselves who will make the presentation. The others may supply the magazines to the remaining teachers in the school, either by personal contact or by mail. One of the young publishers should also be selected to take the magazine to the principal. As to how you place the magazine, whether as a gift or on a contribution basis, you may decide, since circumstances vary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Where will you attend? In most cases it will be practical to attend the nearest assembly. However, due to the large number of brothers in certain metropolitan areas, coupled with the size of cities and assembly auditoriums, it is necessary to make the recommendations below so the attendance will be in keeping with the facilities in each city. This will work for the comfort of all attending. The difference in mileage is only slight and should affect only a very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> As an example, some of the Chicago circuits are slightly nearer to South Bend. Nevertheless, because of the smaller facility it will not be able to accommodate circuits that are being asked to go to Madison, Wisconsin. Please check carefully the following list to see where your circuit is assigned to attend if it is other than the nearest assembly city. So you can benefit most from the program, we know you will want to cooperate with these recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivating or Abandoning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’Having carefully sown the seed In the spring of the year, the gardener knows that he has work ahead, doesn’t he? Regular cultivation must now take place. Of course, he could abandon the field, allowing the weeds to take over. But would that make sense? Hardly. All the labor and money thus far invested would be completely lost.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Are you cultivating or are you abandoning? Having spent time and effort patiently calling at each door to present the good news, tactfully overcoming the objections of some, enduring abuse from others, then finding some interest or placing some literature, what do you do about it?—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> What should we do about it? Really, we should view things as Jehovah does. “He does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Thus when someone shows</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the Teachers Hear! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">express appreciation for the magazine when you give it to them. If so, it may be the ideal time to tell them how they may obtain </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">by mail for only $1 a year. In other cases, a few days after you place it a teacher may tell you how much lie enjoyeil it. If so, tactfully seize the opportunity to offer a subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Congregation servants, please do the following right away: (1) Determine how many schools and schoolteachers there are in your territory. (2) Work out arrangements with young publishers to reach as many teachers as possible in the schools they attend. (3) Determine which schools do not have publishers attending and arrange to cover these as already suggested. (4) Decide how many more magazines you will need and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">order these right away.</span><span class="font8"> The cost may be cared for either by the congregation or by each publisher, as you decide. Some congregations have ordered extra copies already, but you may need still more to care for this special work. Yes, let the teachers hear, and let us all look forward to hearing some of the resulting experiences on the first service meeting in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">any interest at all in the truth our interest in him should immediately be aroused and our minds should begin to formulate plans for cultivating that Interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> When we look at matters this way we begin to appreciate just how many opportunities for cultivating are open to us because of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> campaign. When someone subscribes, we will want to deliver the current issues until the magazines begin to arrive through the mail. Delivering these single issues should never be looked upon as an ✓unimportant, routine work, but, rather, as an outstanding opportunity to do some cultivating work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Do you have difficulty deciding just what to talk about on your back-calls? This need not be true when calling back on a subscriber. Just read carefully an article in a recent magazine that you believe he will be interested in and then discuss it with him. You know the magazine should be in the home, so right there is your opening. If it is lost you will have another one, and whether he did or did not read the article makes little difference; present some of the highlights and stir up interest. Some have obtained double subscriptions or just a subscription for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font8">and then a study article in the first </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> issue of almost any month can be used to start a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>0</sup> Of course, there are obstacles, aren’t there? Time slips by and the back-call isn’t made. Have you failed to deliver the single issues until the mailman makes the delivery? Have you ever received an expiration notice from the Society and realized that you should have called back on that subscriber long </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ago? Are</span><span class="font8"> you using the new feature of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> for starting studies? It makes one think, doesn’t it? This would be a good time to make a self-appraisal and then to improve our cultivating if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>T</sup> What a privilege Jehovah extends to us 1 Right-hearted ones will show that spark of interest that our training will help us to recognize. Would a fellow worker with God willingly abandon such a one? No; rather, doing things Jehovah’s way, we will begin thinking immediately in terms of the cultivating work.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font7">• Why is it important for each Kingdom publisher to report his activity in the field service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has given his people a commission to preach “this good news of the kingdom” in all the inhabited earth. (Matt. 24:14) This is one of the features of the sign showing that we are living in the “time of the end.&quot; As each hour is reported by every publisher, the total report as shown In &quot;Kingdom Ministry” and the &quot;Yearbook&quot; reveals what is being accomplished in preaching this good news. It proves that God’s Word is true, that the work foretold is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By our turning in these reports to the congregation it is possible to ascertain the extent of theocratic activity in the congregation, in the country and in the world. Such information is encouraging to us all. —Prov. 15:30; 25:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a Scriptural basis for such reports. Jesus and the man with the writer’s inkhorn in Ezekiel’s prophecy are both described as reporting on the work they did. (John 17:4; Ezek. 9:11) The reports, when tabulated for each country, help the &quot;faithful and discreet slave&quot; class to determine where the need is greatest and the progress of the work. When some share only in a limited w’ay, their report indicates to the servants that they are in need of help. Thus individual reports remind the servants of those needing assistance, so they can better care for the flock of God. So your service reports benefit both you and all your Christian brothers.</span></p>

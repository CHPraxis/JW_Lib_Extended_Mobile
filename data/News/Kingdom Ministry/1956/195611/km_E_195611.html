<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“HELP EVERY ONE HIS NEIGHBOR”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach to Those on the Outside Train Those on the Inside</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Come up to us quickly and do save us and help us,” cried the Gib-eonites to Joshua. To answer that plea he and his army made an allnight forced march. “Step over into Macedonia and help us,” said a man in a vision to Paul. And Paul promptly went there to preach. Likewise in Achaia, Apollos “greatly helped those who had believed . . . for with intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong, while he demonstrated publicly by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.” Yes, God’s servants have ever helped their neighbor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The same is true of our day, even as foretold: “They help every one his neighbor; and every one salth to his brother, Be of good courage.” (Isa. 41: 6) During the month of November we can have a share in fulfilling this prophecy; first of all, by calling upon our neighbor in our territory and letting him hear an interesting and effective three- to eight-minute sermon, endeavoring to place with him a bound book and a booklet. In doing so let us apply the excellent counsel given in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">October 15, 1956, “Offer Your Sacrifices of Praise Aright.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Of course, to be of lasting help to our neighbor we may not content ourselves with merely leaving literature, but must call back. Do so properly prepared, not only to answer questions and refute objections, but especially to give a good sermon so as to arouse interest in God’s Word and kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Then tactfully work toward a home Bible study. With some a study can be started on the first or second return call; with others it takes longer. Once having started a study, be dependable. Take It as seriously as you want them to take it—-everlasting life is at stake! On the other hand, do not be discouraged if you find they lack dependability or are slow to learn. Patient, cheerful perseverance is required. Fight for the life of your study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As you study with them make them service-conscious by relating interesting experiences. Would they like to accompany you sometime? Remember, in December we are aiming for a ten-percent increase. Start working toward that goal in November.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Helping our neighbor inside the New World society is also obligatory. Help' or be helped toward greater efficiency. Let our slogan during November be, “Each One Help One.” And help, not just to be more effective, but also to be regular, week </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">[OFFER FOR NOVEMBER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Supporting the Service at Jehovah’s!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">House Fully.—Malachi 3:10, AS. }</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PREACH AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Magazines; Use Tracts Freely</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our commission to preach is good twenty-four hours a day, everyday, as long as we live. “All day long will I bless thee, and praise thy name forever and ever,” said David.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Traveling time to and from work Is our time. The noon hour is ours. Use these moments to speak to your working friends and traveling companions. On trips converse with passengers. Talk to gas station attendants when you are refueling. Witness to the grocer when you are shopping, if only briefly. Leave him a tract or a magazine. When salesmen call, preach; when the milkman delivers, preach; when friends stop by, preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Respect people’s time and privacy, however. Do not be rude or overly persistent. Be friendly. Let </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> speak for after week, in all features of the ministry. Progress cannot be made while sitting at home I In giving help be like a good school servant, constructive, practical and encouraging.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> November, because of its holiday, offers a special opportunity. Shall we waste it or use it to preach the good news by magazine activity? Some very fine reports have appeared in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> on holiday witnessing: Bahamas (89), Western Germany (154), India (179), Sweden (271). Congregations having excellent results or unusual experiences should write them in to the Society for others to learn about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> During November will you make full use of your opportunities to help your good-will neighbor on the outside and your witness neighbor on the inside of the New World society? If so, you will bring honor to Jehovah’s name, save yourself as well as your neighbors and share in fulfilling Isaiah 41: 6: “They help every one his neighbor.” you. Encourage them to subscribe for a year. Many will. If they hesitate, offer individual copies. Leave one of the twelve tracts with them. Never be without a supply of tracts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is amazing what you can accomplish. For example, riding home on a train a witness talked to the man beside him. The man showed interest. Today this same man is a study conductor. Another witness reports: “I made it my business to always speak about subscriptions for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">magazines with the public and train crew.” In the past year this publisher obtained over a hundred subscriptions; studies are being held right on the train at 2 a.m. among trainmen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Be an all-day-long praiser of the one true God Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Below are scheduled four service meetings for November. Almost all congregations will have a fifth meeting during the month and they will arrange that meeting locally. There may be some local problem you want to discuss, or a special talk you want to schedule. You might want to pick out some </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">and have a capable brother give a talk on it, or a demonstration might be arranged, or experiences heard, or a review of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> held. It will be easy to arrange a profitable meeting; use well-qualified brothers who will stay within the time assigned.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER </span><span class="font11">Theme: Supporting the Service at Jehovah’s House Fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on “Supporting the Service at Jehovah’s House Fully.” (See “Watchtower,” 11/1/56, p. 670, and 12/15/55, p. 745.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Help Every One His Neighbor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Demonstration on developing magazine routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) “Do you love me?” said Jesus to Peter. Then “feed my little sheep.” It is this warm love for the sheep that prompts us to use every suggestion for increasing our personal magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (6 min.) Group at territory for magazine activity. Captain sees that all have proper supplies, territory for at least two hours’ work, also house-to-house records, since the name and address of all placements will be recorded. Group disperses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A publisher at first door delivers effective 30- to 60-second sermon, featuring information in a specific article. Places both magazines, tactfully obtains householder’s name and says that a special effort will be made to bring the next issues in about two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A second publisher gives sermon at another door, reading a pointed sentence or two directly from magazine. Both magazines are placed, name is obtained and the householder is informed that in about two weeks the publisher will be bringing the next issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Summarize points. Emphasize diligence and effectiveness of both publishers, how information rather than magazines was stressed. (Prov. 22: 29) Territory may be divided into two sections, each worked on alternate magazine days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (8 min.) Two weeks later. Group returns. Captain instructs group to make deliveries first, then work door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publisher makes call on first placement, calling householder by name. Householder says had no time to read magazines. Publisher stresses need to take time same as we do to eat and sleep. Comments on an article in latest issue, emphasizing benefits to reader. Delivery is made, publisher promises to return in two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Second publisher finds householder has read several articles, and shows definite interest. Invited to come in —has many questions. Publisher enters and householder asks first question. As publisher starts answer chairman breaks in and explains that since the householder is enthused and wants information right now the publisher must not refuse. If the publisher refuses, saying he must get on to other doors, the householder is disappointed and may think the publisher is interested only in selling magazines. So the publisher spends some time with the nouseholder, briefly answers the main questions, but does not go into full details. Rather, the publisher arranges for a back-call in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When chairman says this, the demonstration goes back to hear publisher finish last answer and then make back-call arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Make return calls where interest is manifest, holding home Bible studies. Develop routes. As route expands, offer subscriptions to regular receivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Back-call to present information on “Make Sure of All Things”, Jews’ Return to Palestine, p. 215, from Rejection of Jesus to James 4: 4 on p. 216.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “New Benefits from Circuit Servant Visit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on “Preach at Every Opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Suggestion: discuss slogan at bottom of page 4, then local announcements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on keeping the organization clean, based on “Yearbook.” Because Jehovah God, his heavenly organization and his Word are clean, pure and righteous he commands his servants on earth: “Touch nothing unclean! Keep yourselves pure, you who bear the vessels of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Uncleanness reflects unfavorably upon the New World society and interferes with expansion, as is to be seen from the “Yearbook” reports on Eire (104) and Honduras (173).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But keeping clean is a witness in itself, as reports from the Sudan (138), Liberia (208), Poland (244) and Southern Rhodesia (267) show. And it proves false religions wrong, as shown in the Ivory Coast (159).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a joy to note our brothers’ willingness to go to great expense to clean up, as in British Honduras (101), and the good results of stressing cleanness by those who have the oversight, as in Argentina (80).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on material in “Congregation Organization: Better Meetings.” 25 min: Have a panel discussion to bring out points answering the objection, “Why come to us? We have our own religion,” as found in “Presenting the Good News.” Do this in fifteen minutes. Then let chairman have suggestions from audience on answering this objection, for six minutes. The remaining four minutes the chairman will use to summarize the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Suggestion: stress special magazine activity on Thanksgiving Day.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Experiences had on Thanksgiving Day in magazine work. Select some good experiences in advance for presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk on “Make Sure of All ' Things”, Jews’ Return to Palestine, p. 216, from True Nation of Restoration to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23 min: Demonstration on Preparing for Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Plan contactpoint discussions and make them instructive. What should be considered either Sunday or any other morning by a group? (1) The text, (2) discussion of presentation, experiences, etc., (3) definite working arrangements and (4) prayer. (Evening contacts are brief, covering arrangements and prayer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (8 min.) Publishers warmly greet one another as they arrive. At scheduled time conductor promptly starts and leads lively discussion of text. Question is asked on text, several comments made, conductor sums up discussion and reads “Watchtower” comments. Next he has group consider talking points in literature offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN interrupts (M&gt; min.) Other things can be discussed other weeks after considering text, such as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (3 min.) Publisher asked to read and comment on experiences he was to select from “Yearbook” on working Catholic territory (Italy, pages 185-187). Material used as basis for encouraging group to work Catholic territory that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (% min.) Introductions can be considered another week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE III (3 min.) Group discusses how to overcome objections before barrier is raised by householder. One publisher suggests: “I am calling with a vital message from the Bible. Many say that they are not interested, but it is true that really God-fearing persons are always glad to discuss the Scriptures, for the Bible is the book with the answer to our problems.” Another: “I am calling in the interest of right worship. You may say that you have your own religion; that is exactly why I am calling. Haven’t you often wondered why it is that there are so many different religions yet there is only one God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1% min.) Give additional suggestions, such as different publishers’ giving their sermon, group can work out refutations for common objections in territory, etc. Now for organizing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE IV (2 min.) With map in hand conductor assigns individual publishers and service companions streets or blocks to work. Each given enough to last the entire time he plans to be in house-to-house work. Publishers make note of assignment so they will not forget. Conductor checks with each to make sure all have arrangements to make back-calls following at least 2 hours of house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2y<sub>2</sub> min.) Words of caution: Much can be profitably discussed at contact point, but do not try to do this all at once. Take one thing at a time and vary from week to week, using things of practical value in preaching work that day. Contacts should begin promptly on time and last no more than 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Suggestion: discuss the slogan at the bottom of page one.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Better Meetings</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our seven goals for 1957 are vital. Are you taking them seriously? Goal one is better meetings. What have you done about it? Why should you do something about it? Because better meetings depend not just upon servants, but upon all publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Attendance is the first requirement. What would the best program be with no one to listen? Study, preparation and knowledge are second; they will enable you to understand and to participate. And only by understanding, participating and offering helpful, constructive comments can you really do your part toward having better meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> This does not mean that you will read ahead during the meeting to have a comment. Instead, study in advance. You tell good-will people to study before meetings; let them see that you do it yourself. Jot down interesting points or comments in the margin to consider later, but follow along with the reader during the lesson. In this way you will get the most out of the lesson and will set the right example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Only capable brothers should be used on the programs. They should recognize the great responsibility and privilege of speaking to Jehovah’s people, so should prepare properly and speak with enthusiasm.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1957 “Yearbook” and Calendar</span></h4>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes demonstrations have not really been thought out, or have been poorly rehearsed. This should never happen. A demonstration should provide the best information you can offer. It should be prepared carefully and practiced thoroughly. Like the sacrifices offered by Israel, it should be without blemish as far as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Sometimes brothers who are not yet qualified to give public talks at the Kingdom Hall are used for forty-five-minute talks at the book studies. This should not be. Only brothers who qualify for talks at the hall should give these study talks. Speaking to a small group is, if anything, more difficult than speaking to a large one. The newly interested ones deserve the best we have. At the ministry school, not at the book studies, is the place to learn to speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Are your public lectures lively? arresting? informative? Are they clear, simple, colorful and interesting? Do people want to come back? Are the brothers always anxious to hear the talks because of the good information they contain? To have that kind of talk requires real effort. But that effort is expected from the speaker who represents Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Goal one; Better meetings. Achieving it requires real work, but applying these principles will help.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As sons of light, Kingdom ministers are commanded to stay awake and to “keep comforting one another and building one another up.” New benefits from the circuit servant’s visit will help us do this. The increased benefits will also help us to &quot;go on bearing fruit in every good work.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> To increase the benefits from the meetings held during the week of the circuit servant’s visit the following arrangement goes into effect: On Tuesday evening the theocratic ministry school will be kept to about forty minutes. There will be a five-minute review, a fifteen-minute instruction talk and two student talks, the third one being canceled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The service meeting, as usual, follows the school. But the service meeting will adhere to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> schedule for only forty-five minutes. Then the circuit servant will give ten minutes of apt counsel on the two meetings.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Answering: “Why come to us? We have our own religion.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Oftentimes </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> householder will say: “Why come to us? We have our own religion.” Many of these people are good church members and active in its work. So was Saul. A miracle showed him the truth. But at the door you must do it. How can you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The main thing is to stir interest. Get the person to talk. Present such a logical sermon that he wants to hear more. But how to get him to listen? With one of the following themes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The Christian oneness theme: “We come to talk about religious unity. The whole Communist world is united against religion. But religion at home isn’t united, is it? The Bible shows that real Christians would be united: ‘For one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.’ [Matt. 23:8] We have come to talk to you about how that unity will come under God’s kingdom by Christ.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Or: “We’re here because as members of the same community it is good for us to learn about others’ religion. Certainly it promotes understanding and expands our own spiritual knowledge.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The discussion of religion theme: “We come to you because we are encouraging more discussion of religion among all people, both among themselves and with others. We like to talk about religion and are en</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Servant Visit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Coni’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Also heightened are the spiritual benefits of the Saturday evening program. First there will be a fifteenminute talk on our spiritual needs. Following this, a thirty-minute program called “New Things Learned.” This will be conducted by the circuit servant. It will be a review of the high points of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> articles for current months. Chosen, mature publishers will be called on to give two-minute comments. The purpose of “New Things Learned” is to keep us alert and mindful of the truths that we learn through </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> The circuit servant will climax the Saturday evening program with a thirty-minute service talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The circuit servant’s visit should be a week of increased benefits for couraging others to do so. For example, I’d like to know what you think this scripture means.” Use a key text from your serinon to begin the discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Acknowledge the objection and deal with it briefly. You might say: “Of all people, we feel that people who are interested in religion are interested in peace. We have come to talk with you about it.” Show from the Bible how peace really is coming.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> If there is a real objection, you might say: “There is only one way of knowing whether people are associated with any church, and that is by calling at their homes. In fact, this is a Scriptural method. Christ Jesus went from house to house to talk with the people. He sent his disciples from house to house to preach. We are told to do the same thing. So this is a proper work, one that is at the very foundation of Christianity, and one that all Christians should be doing. I should like to explain what we tell the people.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Or: “Rather than being offended at my being here, consider it a carrying out of the things Jesus commanded to be done at this time. At Matthew 24:14 he said [quote it]. We are preaching about that kingdom. You know, there are many different ideas about what the Kingdom is. I should like to show you what the Bible says about it. Since you are interested in religion, I think this would be of greatest interest to you.”</span></p></li></ul>

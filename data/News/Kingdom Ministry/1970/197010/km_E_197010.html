<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Time has passed quickly, and another service year has ended. The annual report has just been completed, and it has certainly been heartwarming for us here at Bethel to see what it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Compared with last year, the average number of publishers in the United States has risen 27,888, to 371,561. Isn’t it wonderful to know that all these have been sharing in magnifying Jehovah’s name? Included among them were 23,507 pioneers each month. And how busy these all have been, for the report shows a marvelous increase over last year of 6,693,117 hours spent in the field ministry, the total this year being 69,791,988, or the equivalent of nearly three million 24-hour days. Just think of it I • Very encouraging too is the report on that important work of conducting Bible studies. There were 295,468 studies conducted each month to aid others to learn God’s life-giving Word. Did you have the pleasure of conducting one of those studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That this Bible study activity, using the six-month study program, is yielding good fruit is evident in the healthy increase in the number of those baptized. For 1969 the total was 29,730; this past year it was 38,790. So we </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font9"> finding those who truly want to be disciples of Jesus Christ, and this makes us rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now we are keenly anticipating what the new service year will bring. There are many new publishers to be helped to mature; there are thousands of Bible students to bring into association with Jehovah’s organization; and the time left in which to start studies with others and to assist them to take their stand with Jehovah is reduced. So, with deep appreciation for the service entrusted to us, let us share in it to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Be assured of our warm love for each one of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your brothers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Help Them to Choose Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>X</sup>A few weeks ago you saw the front cover of the special issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> But now that you have the entire magazine, have you read it? If so, you know how valuable it will be in helping others to appreciate Jehovah’s loving provision for eternal life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The majority of people on whom we call know that we talk about living forever on earth, but they personally 'just don’t believe it. Hasn’t that been your experience? Some object that, if no one ever died, there would not be enough room for everyone on earth. Others say that the fact that people have been dying for thousands of years is proof to them that man was not meant to live forever. Asked if they would not like to live forever, there are those who frankly say “No.” What do you answer when householders respond in this way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The October 8 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is designed to break through their skepticism and to help them to appreciate that what the Bible says about eternal life deserves wholehearted acceptance. It answers their objections in a satisfying way and shows what they must do now in order to choose life. But, of course, they need to get this magazine in their hands and read it in order to benefit from it. So, let’s be enthusiastic about offering it, along with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> to everyone possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Who is there that you especially would like to encourage to read this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span><span class="font9"> Might it be the instrument that would help a relative who, until now, has just not responded? Is there a neighbor who possibly would be moved by it? Why not make a list of these people whom you know personally and see that each one of them receives a copy. As you have observed, the appeal of the October 8 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is broad. It involves every living human—agnostics, church members and others too. Give as many as possible the opportunity to read it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">When arranging your service schedule for the month, could you plan to spend more time in magazine work than you usually do? What a blessing that might prove to be to those who obtain the magazine as a result of your added effort!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> October, as you know, is a subscription month. We feature </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">subscriptions, though you may offer both </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">for $2 if you prefer. True, some people have lots of magazines in their home, but are there any other magazines in the world that fill the needs that these two magazines do? Certainly not! While providing wholesome reading for the entire family, they also answer people’s most searching questions about life and point them to the only way to survive the “great tribulation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Even if they do not at first see the urgent need of having such information, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font9"> has a way of making friends. It has a wide appeal. As a result, a newspaper columnist in Indiana wrote: “I was recently asked to analyze a number of popular magazines. . . . My favorite magazine today is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!” </span><span class="font9">And • a Catholic woman recently wrote to the Society to say: “Your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is one of the finest little publications printed, and my husband and I enjoy it immensely.” They appreciate its wholesome, truthful outlook. This makes Jehovah’s witnesses welcome callers at their door, and it may help them to get on the road to life. So, regardless of what there is about the magazine that appeals to a person, urge him to subscribe. In the course of a year, he may get far more than he expected. Take a positive outlook. Offer subscriptions to workmates or classmates. Talk about subscriptions to those with whom you have recently started studies; they need them. And, by all means, during October offer subscriptions regularly from house to house.</span></p></li></ul>

(Comment on any articles other than the one beginning on page 633.) Demonstrate how to feature it on Magazine Day. (3) Special effort to cover as much of congregation’s territory as possible with both special issues during October. Might arrangements be made for school-age publishers to do some extra magazine work after school on weekdays? Could we spend an extra hour in Magazine Day activity? En route to congregation book study, could we make a few house-to-house calls with magazines or offer magazines to people on the street?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">20 min: “Cameroon Says ‘No!’ to Freedom of Worship.” Start with talk based on article in October 15 “Watchtower,” making clear what is happening to our brothers in Cameroon and why. Then discuss with another brother how knowledge of this situation can fortify us for whatever may lie ahead. (Luke 4:8; John 15:19; Rev. 14:9-12) Finally, ask congregation what they can do to help their brothers in Cameroon. Discuss what might be said in letters of appeal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">15 min: Suggestions on variety in presentations of the “Truth” book. Each chapter provides basis for a fresh approach. Discuss possibilities.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> When you make return calls on those who subscribe or who obtain the individual copies of the magazines, it should be easy to introduce the home Bible study. The special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> stimulates interest in eternal life; the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font9"> can help to build on that interest. The magazine even describes the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book and explains the free study course. Offer to demonstrate how interesting it can be to find answers to their Bible questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> It is a wonderful message that we are privileged to take to people of all kinds. It can change their whole outlook on life and open up to them the opportunity to live forever.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What </span><span class="font3">Are We Doing to ttefigs ©ra®</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As we all know, being a Christian involves much more than publicly preaching the ' good ' news. Among other things, it also includes showing love for our Christian brothers and sisters. Not only the appointed servants are responsible to give attention to the building up of those who are already publishers. Whether we are appointed servants or not, the fact that we “love one. another” identifies us as followers, of Jesus. (John 13:34, 35) This trait is prominent among Jehovah’s witnesses. But is there room for us individually to “widen out” in our concern for our brothers? (2 Cor. G: 11-13) There are so many areas in which help can be given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Some need assistance to get to the meetings. Is there someone that you know who* needs such aid? A circuit servant reports that in a rural congregation in Maryland only a few of the publishers have cars. But those few, with genuine interest in the rest, often make four or five trips in order to get everyone to the Kingdom Hall for meetings. It is obvious that they really care about one another, and that is the way it should be, isn’t it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If yours is a household that has a regular family study, you know what a blessing that, can be I Perhaps, you prepare your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> lesson together. Not only does it enable you to benefit more fully from the' congregation meetings; it also contributes directly and noticeably to your spiritual growth. However, there may be in your congregation newly associated families that do not yet have a regular family-study time. Is there such a family that you could invite to join your household for study from time to time? We know a family of six that has welcomed to their midst a ypung brother whose parents do not share his faith, and each time after he is with them he talks about it enthusiastically for days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> An invitation to share in the service is something else that upbuilds. If y&lt;m are planning to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">gp </span><span class="font9">out on calls a 1&lt; aie. could, you “widen bu</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">t,” p</span><span class="font9">erhaps making a phone call in advance to invite another publisher to go with you? It takes only a few minutes to arrange. Even if you are planning to go to a regular meeting for field service, it could be beneficial to get in touch with another publisher ahead of time, offering to call for him. It_may_be just the encouragement that he needs, and his appreciative response will increase your own happiness in the service. A sister who herself started out in the service just last year has found this to be true. When planning, fier service^ she regularly includes others, working with quite a number each week. She herself has vacation pioneered, but even when she is not able to do that she offers to work with others who are vacation pioneering, perhaps for the first time, to help them make a success of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In every congregation there are those who need help to become effective in their field service. What help can you offer? D</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">o you find it.easy </span><span class="font9">to place </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">magazines</span><span class="font9">? Then why not offer to take along someone who does not get the same results and show him how you doit? Some may do well in drawing<sup>-</sup> householders into conversation; others would be grateful to learn how. Perhaps your delight is in conducting home Bible studies. Invite someone to go with you and learn to share that pleasure. Not all of us have the same abilities, but, no matter who we are, there are ways that we can help one another.—Rom. 12 : G-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> The fact that we are personally in,need of help in some respect does not mean that we cannot also give heli) b) others. Dor example, an ’’elderly, sister in Brooklyn finds it very difficult to walk and she is grateful that a nearby family takes her with them by car to the meetings. But she is also alert to her opportunities to help. One morning each week she cares for their young boy who is not well so that the mother can more easily share in the field service. She also invites certain hardworking publishers to stop at her house for a quick lunch, knowing that her preparation can help them to get a full day in the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> The disciple James reminds us that true worship includes the showing of special consideration for “orphans and widows in their tribulation.” (Jas. 1: 2G, 27) Those who are experiencing hardship need en-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Of course, we are all busy. Our schedules are usually full.'But to a considerable extent, our concern for one another can be shown by including others in the things we already do—going to meetings, sharing in the field service, and studying.

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> You can make good use of that cover when offering the magazine?. You might say: “Hello. I’m glad to find you at home.

There just is not time to do all the things that we would really like to do, isn’t that so? [Let householder express self.] In this regard, the Bible says something very interesting. [Read John 17: 3.] Is it really possible to live forever? Interestingly, man has learned that our brain has the capacity to serve for a billion times as long as we now use it. But the Bible is the only source that tells us how it is possible to live that long, and, not only to live, but to enjoy life. Isn’t such a prospect certainly -worthy of our</span></p>

Living without regard for godly principles, they find themselves frustrated. Family problems burden them down. Economic difficulties and injustice result in discouragement, even a feeling of bitterness. These are the ones that may tell you that they don’t want to live forever.

<p><span class="font7"># Are there ways in which we can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for others while engaging- in the field ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In our house-to-house ministry, if publishers are organized into small groups it will be easier for the one in charge to keep them all busy. (“Lamp,” p. 82; km 6/69 p. 8) It is helpful when instructions given before entering the territory include directions as to where the publishers are to work, instead of having everyone meet on some street in the territory for further directions. Also, it is good to discuss in advance what to do if they run out of territory before the end of the scheduled time for witnessing. Thus it will not be necessary to wait in a car or stand on a street corner until additional territory can be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some have found it effective to start from preselected points and work toward each other in residential areas or apartment buildings as well as rural territory. In this way they do not need to be concerned about whether certain homes have been worked or not, as is sometimes the case when working alternate homes. Rather, they can just keep on working until they meet each other. But where it is necessary to have someone close by in the territory, doing every other house may be advantageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many factors to be considered. Really, no rules are necessary or advisable. What may be advantageous in certain areas may not work .well elsewhere. Weather conditions and the physical circumstances of the /publishers need to be considered. But it is beneficial to endeavor to reduce J the amount of time spent in waiting for others so more time can be used for actual witnessing.</span></p>

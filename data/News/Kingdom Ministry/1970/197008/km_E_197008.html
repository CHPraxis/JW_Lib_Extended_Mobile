<p><span class="font10">The Bethel family was abuzz on Monday morning after returning from some of the first eastern conventions at Jersey City, Boston, Pittsburgh and other cities. What fine talk there was about spiritual food provided and the excellent dramas that were put on. How very upbuilding the “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly proved to be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, everyone was interested in how many were at the first group of conventions. For the eleven cities we had reports on, the attendance came to be 180,928 for the public meetings. But think of those baptized! 3,512! There Is no slowing down on persons taking their stand, is there?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a surprise to get the deluxe </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font10"> They moved fast, even ^at $3.00 per copy. We learned that there were 120,000 deluxe Bibles sent to the various conventions in the United States and now, beginning August 1, congregations will be able to order their requirements for those brothers who were not able to get a copy at the convention if they want one. As someone here said: “We hope congregation servants will only order deluxe Bibles for those who really want one, or who want to give it as a gift to someone. We do not have enough to store them on shelves.” Anyway, we would like to distribute these deluxe Bibles as far as we can around the world among the English-speaking brothers who need a deluxe Bible. This Bible release, along with the public meeting booklet, was very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The feeling at Bethel is that everyone attending the convention went away happy, delighted and built up spiritually. What a marvelous climax to the 1970 service year! If you have not been able to get to an assembly as yet, do everything you can to do so. It is certainly worth it</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everyone feels the urgency of the times, and the need for the preach-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Declaring the Good News in All Our Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “I started a study with a man, and there he was at the meeting on Sunday. What a thrill!’.’ Would you like to get that kind of joy from your ministry? Many brothers are reporting excellent results from their studies in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, with people responding quickly to invitations to come to meetings and into the service. It is just such ones that we want to find and help to appreciate the truth. But how can we do it? One way is by covering our territory thoroughly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus and his disciples began the Christian ministry, there was plenty of territory to cover, and the account says, “They went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news.” (Luke 9:6) Now, of course, in many places the territory is getting well covered. The Society’s territory desk reports that this year will be the best for covering isolated territories throughout the country. About 500 congregations, along with approximately 100 pioneers who are serving temporarily as special pioneers, are ing of the Kingdom good news with all diligence. We can tell that by what all of you did in June. Almost unbelievable! But a new peak in publishers was enjoyed, namely 383,773. That is an increase of 3,223 over last April, and not only that, you placed 738,587 bound books. It is simply wonderful!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Now we are beginning our final month of this 1970 service year, and all of us are confident that Jehovah will make it the grandest year ever of praise to him by His men of goodwill. May Jehovah’s blessing go with you, as we together show our deep appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bbookltn Bbanch Office </span><span class="font10">sharing in working Isolated areas to accomplish this work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In some cities with many publishers in a small area, there seems to be a shortage of territory, or the brothers say that the same territories are worked often. What can be done in such a case? Can we stretch our territory? In some ways we can. First of all, let us use and follow up on all not-at-home records. A territory is not completely worked unless this is done. Do you use these not-at-home records and personally follow up on them? It is always good to keep two records, one for the interest found and the other for recording not-at-homes. One brother who followed up three “not-at-homes” recently reported placing two books and starting a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you have large apartments where you are not permitted to work, have you tried writing to the occupants of the apartments, perhaps sending a tract along with an invitation? Some brothers have left magazines with the doorman to be distributed to the occupants or to be left where the ones living in the building can pick up copies, along with an invitation for them to do so. Some brothers report that street work outside such large restricted apartments has also provided personal contacts for later calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Are you thoroughly working the business territory as well as the residential? Do you try working your territories at different times to reach different members of the family? Evenings provide excellent opportunities to find working people and students at home. Sometimes there is a language barrier. If so, have you tried using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Preach the Word”</span><span class="font10"> booklet? When you meet blind persons, do you contact the Society for Braille literature or call </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 2, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Offering the “Evolution” book. Over two years since we have featured “Evolution” book as main offer from door to door. Children will be returning to school and can offer it to any teachers who did not receive it previously and to new classmates. Refer to the May 1968 “Kingdom Ministry” insert for suggestions. Demonstrate ways “Evolution” book can be placed, particularly using illustrations. Some may use Illustration on page four, commenting that thinking people are concerned about where we came from. The scientific and Scriptural answer can be found in the book. Page 118 has a diagram explaining the miracle of human birth, attesting to the wisdom of God. Point out this diagram and then show also the illustration on page 123, which indicates the complicated navigational aids that man needs to accomplish what birds do by instinct. If some do not believe in evolution or are not interested in the subject, then refer to the illustrations on pages 183 and 185 using portions of the scriptures on these pages (Isaiah 11:6-9, Isaiah 65:21-23 and Psalm 37:10, 11, 29) to show what God has promised.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Do not feel that you call too often. Obviously the better we know the people the more we can talk to them and the more we can accomplish our objective of declaring the good news. We need to get on a friendly basis with the people to be effective in our ministry. Show concern for them and get to know them by name. Soon they will not be fearful when they see you coming, and you may find that more doors are open for you. In this way more studies will be started, and you too may enjoy the thrill of seeing some I of these newly interested ones come to meetings for the first time.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Builders of</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A key role in the steady spiritual growth of each one associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s people is played by the congregation book study servant. When he is alert to his privileges, he makes a fine contribution to both the spiritual and numerical growth of the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> There are many things a book study servant does to build up his brothers. For example, he knows that, just as it is important for him to emphasize the urgency of our times when conducting a home Bible study with interested persons, it is also beneficial to keep tills before his brothers during the congregation book study. (2 Pet. 1:12; 3:1, 14) He recognizes that the pressures of this system of things progressively make greater demands on our time and energy. Therefore, he is interested in helping each one in his group to maintain a balanced view toward spiritual pursuits. Thus they will be aided to continue growing in love for Jehovah and in appreciation for his spiritual provisions. The book study servant is to take a keen interest in the spiritual needs of each publisher and Interested person associated with his group. When conducting the book study he is not merely to try to cover a certain amount of material. It should be his aim to see that each one benefits , spiritually from the study, growing in depth of appreciation for Jehovah and drawing closer to him. He wants all to benefit from the book study in some way each week. Would you say his responsibility is light? By no means!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But there is more to be done, and he willingly gives of himself. If some do not understand the material at the study, it is his responsibility to determine the reason and apply the remedy. Perhaps they just do not know how to study. If that is so, then he may call on the individual or family group personally and consider with them a few paragraphs in the material for the coming book study. He may teach them how to prepare an answer for some of the paragraphs so they will be able to comment during the study. What a blessing he can be to the group in this way, helping them to ‘make public declaration of their hope,’ and how upbuilding this is, not only to the one commenting, but to all in attendance! (Heb. 10: 23-25) Indeed, he tenderly cares for those Jehovah has entrusted to him and they in turn love him for it. How easy it is to follow Paul’s counsel at Philipplans 2: 29 to “keep holding men of that sort dear” 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The book study servant knows</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spirituality</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">that “with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” (Rom. 10:10) While most of those In his group no doubt have the right heart appreciation, some probably need help in preparing Scriptural presentations for the house-to-house ministry. If he cannot give personal attention to each one. he knows there are reliable brothers and sisters In his group who are willing to offer assistance, so he may call upon them for help. Thus the entire group works together so all can serve Jehovah effectively, adding to their joy and resulting in many blessings. Too, he lovingly makes appointments to work with those needing encouragement to take part in field activity. Such appointments may be made before or after the book study or by speaking with the individuals at one of the other meetings during the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> What a fine privilege the book study servant enjoys! What opportunities there are to build up his brothers and other interested persons! True, he has much responsibility, but the joy and satisfaction he receives as he faithfully discharges this responsibility and observes the steady spiritual growth of those in his group make it all worth while. How much all of us appreciate these undershepherds and their hard work!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A peak of publishers in June! Unusual you say? Yes, for not since 1948 has June been a peak month. There were 383,773 publishers in the field service, or 3,223 more than in April, our previous peak month. What a joy it is to see the marvelous increase that Jehovah is giving! It certainly makes all of us happy, does It not, to have at least some part in assisting new ones to take their stand on Jehovah’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There were 295,514 studies conducted during the month. When you consider that at most of these studies more than one learner is present, it makes each of us realize that there are bright prospects for much greater increase. Each one of us conducting a study should carefully sound down the truth into the minds and hearts of the learners so after starting to preach to others they will continue to do so, steadily progressing to maturity. With June’s fine peak behind us let us now care well for these new ones, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting in September</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There will be a change in the circuit servant’s routine, designed to help each book study servant give even better care to his group. As you know, the circuit servant has been visiting a book study group on Thursday night and sitting in as an observer. After attending the study he offers private counsel and suggestions to the book study servant. He will continue to do this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What, then, is the change? Starting on September 1, and continuing through the 1971 service year he will, on Friday nights after the committee meeting, meet with all the book study servants.

Then, before leaving, try selecting another topic they would like to discuss on another occasion. The important thing is to get and hold the interest of the people, and careful thought and preparation will help us to do that. As in all teaching, the key is keeping it simple, emphasizing the main points. Then when we get done we can ask the person the question under discussion and have him tell us, for example, why God has permitted wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Emphasizing how much can be learned in a few minutes, and how quickly the discussion has brought out the information will be encouraging to them to continue the discussion or study on another occasion, perhaps with more in the family sharing. Why not try it?

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do'You Return?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you often told householders with whom you place literature, “I look forward to returning to talk to you again and seeing how you enjoyed the publication”? While many of these people may not have any particular interest, others are sincerely looking forward to our return, as our own experiences and those from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> have shown. We do not want to fail them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When we do return, if we simply ask, “How did you like it?” we are throwing the burden on them. How much better It is to be prepared with something to stimulate their Interest. It has been suggested that when we place a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book we ought to give them at least one opportunity to accept a home Bible study. But some people may decide that they can read it for themselves and do not want to be obligated for something as difficult as a “study” may seem to be. However, suggesting a brief demonstration of our arrangement to learn about the Bible at home may help in getting a study started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> At times other methods work better. After all, we cannot start a baby out on a full-course meal, so we may have to do a little coaxing, as it were, to get some who are spiritual babes started on a diet for their spiritual strength. Just as many have found that a thoughtprovoking question on a subject will arouse interest in taking the magazines, so a variety of subjects may appeal to different ones in getting a study started. Instead of asking, “Would you like to have a Bible study?” you might say: “People have so many different ideas on religious subjects, it is good to see just what the Bible has to say. Many have asked why God has permitted wickedness so long; others wonder why we grow old and die, or how to pray and be heard by God. Which Bible subject interests you?” In other words, we do not ask if they would like to study, but rather ask them which question interests them. Often such a positive choice helps, and we will then have the opportunity to refer them to the chapter in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book dealing with the subject and to show them how the question can be answered.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question (ISox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">• Who may have a part on the service meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Basically, any publisher in good standing with the congregation, including young children, may be used in some way on the service meeting. However, when it comes to putting a . brother in charge of a service meetir part, the overseer is to assign on.y dedicated and baptized males who set &gt;, a good example as Christians. (&quot;Lamp” book, pp. 55, 182, 183) Where there is a shortage of brothers, sisters can assist. (&quot;Lamp” book, pp. 154, 155).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is well to use a variety of publishers on the service meeting so that, if possible, the same ones are not on the program all the time. Some portion may be assigned to a book study servant and he may pick out various ones in his group to assist him, keeping in mind the using of others for future parts. Where there is a willingness to be used and fine cooperation with scheduled rehearsals of demonstrations, the meetings become very instructive and run smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> During the 1971 service year the circuit servant will not conduct any of the congregation meetings as he has been doing during the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">« The effect of these meetings held with the book study servants should be most wholesome for the entire congregation as the book study servants apply the information they have learned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">What fine groundwork we have laid for our summer ministry! Reports for March and April are thrilling. Of special interest to us is the grand news that we had our fourth new peak in publishers this service year. Yes, in April we attained a peak of 380,550 publishers. How heartwarming to know that there are 5,672 more fellow praisers of Jehovah than ever before in this country ! Isn’t that cause for rejoicing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During April, when we were featuring special issues of tlie magazines, we also enjoyed a marvelous peak in magazine placements. Why, we placed an amazing total of 9,157,773! What a tremendous witness was given concerning God’s provision for those who love him to benefit from restoration of Paradise! At the same time our four-month subscription campaign moved well be-■ifyond any previous results with a total of 797,089 new subscriptions! Last year’s peak was 692,052.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here are some other good reports for you: Back-calls in April reached a new peak of 3,283,549. This shows fine concern for those manifesting interest. Bible studies, up from March, totaled 327,159. Also commendable is the high number of regular pioneers —a new peak of 15,235. What about vacation pioneers? Well, during our special spring campaign we had a total of 32,026! (22,404 of them in April) The previous peak for both March and April was back in 1965, when we had 27,748 vacation pioneers. What fine zeal shown! Think too of how much encouragement all these pioneers were to other publishers. And, of course, vacation pioneering was made possible in some cases because other family members cooperated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You will also be interested to know that on May 5 Brother Knorr left for a three-week visit to Europe. He was to visit the branches in Wiesbaden and in London to handle problems in connection with the expansion of the Kingdom work there, .nd he planned to be present in ^Switzerland at the time of the dedi-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Why Not Before Now?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Why has nqt the “great tribulation” come before now? Is it because the world is not bad enough? No! Is it because Jehovah is slow? No, rather, he is most patient. (2 Pet. 3:9) He knows the day and hour and will not postpone it. (Matt. 24: 36) Why, then, has the “great tribulation” not come before now? Because Jehovah, in setting the time for it to break, has foreseen the need for time in which to preach the good news “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” “Then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) That day and hour is near!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In the time that remains we want to share as fully as we can in the ministry to aid others of honest heart to learn of Jehovah and his loving provisions for salvation. This month we will enjoy offering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the</span><span class="font9"> Word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of God?</span><span class="font9"> on a contribution of $1.25. If a householder has the Bible, we can offer the book, or if cation of the new branch office and printery in Thun. Just before Brother Knorr left, he told us some encouraging news at the Bethel table: During March we had publisher peaks in many parts of the world! For example, 20 countries in the Americas reported new peaks, 17 in Western Europe and 11 in Africa.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Here in the United States, as you know. Memorial attendance was very good. The final figure was 836,058— up 87,583 from last year! There were 4,609 partakers. For the special public talk we had an attendance of 548,240. Now It’s our privilege to help these many interested ones to get to this summer’s district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our spiritual blessings keep on ever increasing, don’t they? Meanwhile, the Devil’s system deteriorates and evils multiply—all the more reason to go on conquering the evil with Christian good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font9">one has tlie book, we will offer the Bible. This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> has a variety of suggestions for making the offer and starting home Bible studies. Feel free to use what is most, effective for you in helping people in the territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> More daylight hours are with us during summer months. Many find evenings an excellent time to make the offer and return calls. In many territories people are home evenings more than during the day and generally are less hurried and more relaxed so we can talk with them. One publisher making evening calls contacted 13 out of 15 householders (literature was placed with 11) in a territory where few were contacted during the day or on weekends. If you can, why not share in evening witnessing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Many business people are seldom contacted at home. They need to be warned of the tribulation’s fast approach, don’t they? Have you witnessed in the congregation’s business territory? A pioneer overseer in Nebraska placed 200 Bibles with motel managers, and a publisher in California placed 43 with managers. An Interested person wrote (as a result of reading the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> -while staying at a motel) : ‘I was very interested in it and would like to have a copy if they are for sale. How much do they cost and where can I obtain one?’ If motels, hotels and other business territory has not been covered, magazineterritory servants, why not arrange this month for mature, experienced publishers who can effectively handle these calls to work it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Have you recently considered the condition of the Bible you use in field service? Why this question? A circuit servant wrote: ‘I have gone from house to house with publishers using Bibles whose pages were falling out, covers partially torn off, and otherwise mutilated or unkempt. I have often seen a sort of surprise </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font9"> 4, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. May’s report for congregation. Song 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: &quot;Will They Hear Without Someone to Preach?” (Rom. 10:14) Song 89.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">14 mln: &quot;Thinking About It?” Question-and-answer coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Direct Approach for Starting Studies. (Discuss and demonstrate.) In many areas this approach produces excellent results. A circuit servant in Colorado reports that, in addition to the new studies he started (37 in the last 3 months and his wife 25), ‘the publishers and pioneers during my visits to the last 5 congregations started 59 studies and, since the week of my visit, 44 more.’ This makes a total of 103 new studies started by publishers and pioneers using some of these helpful suggestions submitted by the circuit servant: “The emphasis was placed on the offer to demonstrate the study rather than placing emphasis on the study course itself. If householders are asked if they would like to have the study course, before it is demonstrated, usually they will give a negative reply. Some publishers were discouraged in using the direct approach until first trying to demonstrate the study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Basically the following approach was used: 'Good morning, my name is---.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’m one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I imagine you have your own religious affiliation? [Let them answer.] It is encouraging to know that you still believe in God at a time when so many people are becoming godless. I’m sure you will agree that things would be much better today if more people would study the Bible in their own homes and live according to Bible principles. [Let them comment.] We are encouraging home reading of the Bible and offering a free study course. It answers many questions such as, Why do we grow old and die?, Where are the dead?, W’hy does God permit wickedness?, and many other questions people wonder about. If you have just a few minutes I would like to demonstrate how you can find the answers to such questions in your own Bible. Then you would be in a better position to decide whether you would like the free Bible study or not.’ If they say yes, the Bible-study folder can be used, suggesting they pick a question they would like answered from the Bible. If they hesitate, you can ask if they are interested in knowing the condition of the dead or knowing if present world conditions were foretold in the Bible, etc. (Use Bible to answer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He concludes, ‘Some new studies have been lost on the first few calls because of trying to get the householder to read paragraphs or scriptures when they do not care to do so.’ Why not ask, ‘Would you like to read or would you prefer that I do so?’ If householder does not desire Bible study demonstration, go ahead with your sermon presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate points from Announcements. Song 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: ‘Handling the Word of Truth Aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) Song 100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Question Box. Talk and experiences as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Indirect Approach for Starting Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman: What other approach can we use to start studies If individuals are hesitant, feel uneasy when the direct method is used or may not be ready to accept the responsibility of the six months’ study program? Have you tried the indirect method of starting studies? The “Lamp” book, page 93, states: “At first the person may not even realize that he is having a home Bible study; he just enjoys the fine Bible discussions. In many parts of the world it is necessary to make a number of calls, discussing a variety of topics and answering questions, before it is possible to get down to a regular study.” (See 1970 &quot;Yearbook,” p. 232.) Our offer this month opens the way for studies to be started when placing the Bible or on making return visits by &quot;discussing a variety of topics and answering questions” before getting down to a regular study. Why not try the following suggestions, depending upon the interest or questions of the householder?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(14 min.) Bible study servant interviews two study servants. After discussing the suggested indirect approach for starting studies, a servant can demonstrate it. (1) Discuss how publishers can use “Important Bible Words for Quick Reference,” starting on page 1341 of “New World Translation&quot; to aid householders to get acquainted with Bible and to clarify topics of interest such as death (condition of the dead), earth (man’s home), Jehovah, resurrection, etc. Demonstrate how householder is directed to material in the back of the Bible, assisted to use his Bible in looking up scriptures, explaining them, etc. On concluding discussion, servant arouses householder’s interest In another subject to be explained on next call. (2) Discuss how publishers can prepare Bible discussion material on subject of interest to householder from the Bible, “Word of God,” “Make Sure,&quot; &quot;Truth” books, “Watchtower,” “Awake!,” etc. For example, publisher may list scriptures from Chapter 4 of “Truth” book. (Servant demonstrates use of following on a call)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Why We Grow Old and Die”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 1:28, 31—Man provided lovely home</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 2:16, 17—Would live if obedient Gen. 3:1-6—Disobedience of first pair (Select appropriate portions)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 3:22-24—Lawless couple to die Rom. 5:12—Effect upon offspring Is death (Also Job 14:4 could be used)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 John 4:9—Ransom provided by means, of Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:3, 4—Kingdom rule will do<sup>J </sup>away with death</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman: Same can be done with “Word of God” book, such as Chapter 10, &quot;Bible Prophecies You Have Seen Fulfilled.” Be discerning in ascertaining interest of householder, as it helps us to determine if all scriptures should be discussed, if it is advisable to switch to another subject of greater interest, etc. Use indirect method with goal of starting a study. 20 min: Associations. (Handled by mature brother. Ask questions below. Allow audience to answer freely.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What position do Christians take with respect to the world? (John 15:19; Jas. 4:4) Is it possible to avoid all contact with unbelievers? (1 Cor. 5:9, 10; John 17:15, 16) Why is it so imperative to watch our associations? (Prov. 13:20; 2 Pet. 2:18) How should we view all social companionships with those not in the truth? Why? (Gen. 34:1, 2; 1 Cor. 15:33: Eph. 5:7-12; w66, p. 49, par. 5) What kind of association is encouraged in the Bible? (Matt. 18:20; Acts 2:42; Heb. 10:24, 25; w70, p. 150, par. 20) How would the above principles be applied to the following associations? Give scriptures or Bible grinciples to support your answers, choolmates and fellow employees? (Ps. 119:115; w66, pp. 49-51; 2 Cor. 6:14-17; 2 Tim. 3:2, 5; 1 Pet. 4:4) Dis-fellowshiped persons? (1 Cor. 5:11; Rom. 16:17; “Lamp” book, p. 180) Dating those not dedicated? Gv64, p. 155, par. 1; w67, p. 765; w69, p. 373, par. 26; w65, p. 562, par. 11) What is the purpose of dating and what may. a congregation rightfully expect of those who regularly date for an ex-» tended period of time? (w64, p. 155, par. 3) Marriage? (Deut. 7:3, 4; 1 Cor. 7:39; 2 Cor. 6:14, 15) It one thinks these Bible principles are restrictive, what could be said to aid and encourage him? (w66, p. 53) 10 min: Concluding comments. Song 117.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do They Know?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It’s wonderful to have so many new ones with us at our congregation meetings and taking part in Jehovah’s service. We enjoy having .hem with us to benefit from the ’fine spiritual feasts Jehovah provides. Too, we have been able to encourage and assist many of them to attend nearby circuit assemblies, which added to their spiritual growth. Thousands of them have yet to experience the joy of attending a district assembly. Can we assist many to attend a district assembly this summer? Do they know what to do in preparation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> As we all appreciate, attending a district assembly usually Involves much more than attending a nearby circuit assembly. Unless one lives within a short distance of the assembly city, rooming arrangements must be made. Do they know what to do? where to get rooming forms? how to fill them out? where they are to be sent, among other things?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> And, what about transportation? If they do not have a car, do they know what to do in arranging transportation? While most of us are used to traveling, having attended various assemblies, many people are</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Thinking</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">.. <sup>1</sup> The Ethiopian eunuch, after hav-•Tji'ng the truth explained to him and seeing his responsibility, did more than only think about it, didn’t he? He said: “What prevents me from getting baptized?” (Acts 8:36) Many of us who followed the Ethiopian’s wise decision as to being baptized have since been thinking for some time now about pioneering and most appropriately may ask ourselves, ‘What prevents me from pioneering?’ It is a good question to consider, isn’t it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Pioneering is a field of service that deserves serious consideration. While some have family or other Scriptural responsibilities that prevent them from getting into the regular pioneer service now, many have been able to enroll as pioneers as is noted from Nie over 15,000 now serving as regular pioneers! Here are some encouraging examples to think about:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> A young brother was offered a scholarship to a university. He (under the wise guidance of his parents) had been thinking about pioneering after graduation. What did lutjlo? Having in mind Jesus’ words Matthew 6:33, he followed ‘xSorough on his thoughts, became a regular pioneer and is now enjoying the special pioneer service, looking not accustomed to travel and, unless encouraged, and at times assisted, they hold back from making travel arrangements. Perhaps we may even be able to include them in our own travel plans.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Many new publishers are looking forward to being baptized at the district assembly. Do they know what to do? In addition to covering the questions in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Lamp’’</span><span class="font9"> book, do they know that they are to have with them on the day of baptism a bathing suit and towel? Are they acquainted with the volunteer service arrangement and how to share in it, if that is their desire? And do they know of the moderate-priced meals made available at the assembly so all can care for physical needs and still be at the assembly location to enjoy Christian association and benefit from the entire program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Why not spend some time encouraging newly associated ones to attend a district assembly, covering the above and other points that will be of benefit to them? By so doing, we will be sure they know what to do, and, additionally, this may be the encouragement they need to attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>About It?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">forward to attending Gilead School. Surely Jehovah has blessed him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> A sister who also did more than think about it wrote: ‘I talked it over with my husband and our son. We agreed that by cutting down on expenses I could quit doing secular work and we could have a pioneer in the family.’ As a pioneer she is enjoying added blessings and the family is benefiting in a very wholesome way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Have you thought about pioneering but wondered if your health would permit it? A sister with this very question decided to check with her doctor and thereafter wrote: ‘I was very happy to learn that nothing really stood in my way.’ Today she is doing very well as a pioneer. A brother who had been thinking about it for many years summed it up nicely when enrolling as a pioneer: “I finally wound up my affairs and did what I should have done some time before this.’’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Many are now thinking about pioneering and this is fine, for it is the first step to becoming a regular pioneer. The next step is to make definite plans to put these good thoughts into action. What can assist in this regard? Many pioneers tell us they had their questions answered and also received fine encouragement from attending meet</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Another fine opportunity is when the circuit servant is with your congregation. As an experienced “pioneer” he will be pleased to discuss pioneering with you. Circuit servants’ wives have been most en- • couraging to sisters thinking about pioneering. And many others were encouraged after talking to pioneers themselves, as well as to servants and other mature publishers.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> So, brothers, by all means, continue to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">think</span><span class="font9"> about pioneering. And, while you are thinking about it and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">arranging</span><span class="font9"> your affairs to that end, why not enroll as a vacation pioneer whenever you can? One regular pioneer wrote, “I enjoyed vacation pioneering so much I just couldn’t stop.&quot; This may be your rewarding experience.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Briefly and to the Point</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We are all interested in using effective presentations to place the Bible-and-book offer. Often fine results are experienced by being brief and getting to the point quickly. Here is a presentation two pioneers used to place over a hundred Bibles in a single month!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> ‘I'm engaged in an educational work, speaking briefly to people about world conditions. They’re not getting any better, are they? [Let them comment.] There is so much delinquency, no respect for law and order: problems and anxieties are everywhere. Do you think there Is some significance to all of this or some reason why we are having all these troubles at this particular time? [Let them comment.] We’ve been directing people to the Bible as the place they can find a reliable answer as to why we are having these troubles and what God is going to do about them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> ‘The Bible tells us that we are living in the last days of the present wicked system of things and God is soon going to bring relief through his kingdom for which we pray. I don’t know if you are like I am, but I’ve found parts of the Bible rather hard to understand. Do you find it that way? [Display Bible.] This</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Why Not Before Now? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">(Cotlf’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">on the face of some householders when they see the Bible, a book many of them hold to be sacred, in such a condition.’ While all of us get used to the ‘feel’ of a Bible we have long used and perhaps feel comfortable with it, it would be good for us to determine if the Bible we use in the field service would offend the ones we are desirous of assisting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> The Bible-and-book offer opens the way for many new Bible studies. When it comes to the Bible-study work none of us ask, Why is it so important? For, almost without exception, as the result of someone’s conducting a study with us we learned the truth. Each time when engaging in field service we ask for Jehovah’s blessing to be with us. Do we also pray for the privilege of conducting a Bible study? First John 5:14 tells us, “No matter what it Is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.” Always we want to have a positive attitude and not modern-English translation of the Bible uses our everyday speech. For example, note the clarity of 2 Timothy 3 regarding the “last days.” [Use appropriate points; verses 1 to 5, depending upon householder, then offer Bible and book.]’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The following short presentation may be of help to children and newer publishers and when we contact busy householders: ‘My name is----.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">I’m making brief calls on those who love God and who would like to have a better knowledge of the Bible. Many people say they do not understand their Bible and have longed for an easy-to-read translation of the Bible in the English spoken today. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A’eio World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> [display it] fills this need. This copy is yours along with this hook [display </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font9"> book], which assures us that the Bible really is the Word of God, on a contribution of $1.25.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Or you might try this abbreviated presentation: ‘Many people today desire to have the Bible in the English language used now. I’m pleased to offer you this complete Bible in easy-to-understand, modern English [show it] along with this book [show it] which aids us to know that the Bible really is the Word of God.’ only pray to Jehovah that he will help us to find those of honest heart in the territory but make advance preparation so we can share in the Bible-study work. As we continue asking and doing our part, we may be assured that Jehovah’s spirit will back us up in our efforts to find those who lean toward righteousness. (Matt. 7:7) If you are not sharing in the Bible-study service, or are in position to have a fuller share, why not make it your goal to begin doing so this month?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> With ever greater momentum “this good news of the kingdom” is being “preached in all the inhabited earth.” In the near future Jehovah’s set time for the &quot;great tribulation” to start will be here and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;then the. end will come.&quot;</span><span class="font9"> These things we know, and that is why it is our determination to continue preaching and teaching just as long as Jehovah wishes us to do so, to help those of honest heart to survive the “great tribulation.”</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>(Question, Box</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">• How can people in your territory contact Jehovah's witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some congregations have a telephone at the Kingdom Hall listed in the phone book under ‘‘Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This has been helpful to many desiring to contact us. But-what if no one is at the hall when someone calls? An interested person in a Midwest city made ten phone calls (three Kingdom Halls were listed) but was unable to contact anyone because no one was at the halls to answer. The overseer may want to list another phone number to call if there is no answer at the Kingdom Hall— either his own number or that of someone who can make tactful reply to those who call. (“Lamp” book, p. 64) Many fine experiences have been sent to the Society concerning interested persons who contacted Jehovah’s witnesses by phone. As a result of publishers’ writing a phone number on the Bible-study folder, numerous householders have called requesting Bible studies. One experience states: “The lady phoned and said she had been thinking about studying the Bible and would enjoy It very much. A study was started and the interested person now attends meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many congregations have arranged for a free listing in the local newspaper of the Kingdom Hall address together with day and time of meetings, and this has been a means of helping people to get in contact with us. (See Question Box in July 1967 “Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, we keep in contact with the greatest number of people by our sharing in field service, making liberal use of the handbills, which provide the Kingdom Hall address and time of meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">MAY 1970 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“G<sub>o</sub> therefore and make disciples . . . baptizing them.”—Matt. 28:19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. XIII NO. 5</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>kingdom</span><span class="font16"> ^PubCisk/tS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Forward! was the watchword for March. With the Memorial and the special public talk a great impetus was given to our work, so much so that 374.878 publishers went forth preaching the good news. Isn’t that a marvelous new peak?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That means that for the first seven months of our service year our average of publishers has been 364,360. When that figure is compared with last year’s we find that on the average we have 20,687 more regular publishers in the field each month this year. And during the same seven months 20,721 persons were baptized in the United States. Is it not remarkable that the number baptized is so close to the average increase in regular publishers? It is clear that those dedicating their lives to Jehovah are doing •xactly what they should do—mov-ng right into the field service and offering regular support to those who have continued faithful for many years. This is a delight to our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And there’s another fine increase —185,351 new subscriptions in March, or about 21,000 more than last March. Also, 7,082,547 magazines were distributed, and this represents over three-quarters of a million more than for March last year. The number of Bible studies is also moving up again. There were 307,873, and these are not people we have been studying with for years and years with little result. No, for every six months on the average we are studying with a new group of people, people who are grasping the truth and fleeing from Babylon the Great. How good that is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So far reports show that over 810,000 attended the Memorial in the United States. That signifies an increase already of well over 60,000, with about 90 congregations still to be heard from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Things are truly moving ahead, and now the April report will be looked for with keen anticipation. After that, onward to the assemblies thk-&gt; summer and the fine spiritual</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Being Well-Pleasing to God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the fact that it means everything to them to please God. Jesus took the lead in this and, while on earth, set the pattern for us. He said: “He that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.” (John 8:29) He told the crowds that came to hear him: “This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in him whom that Oue sent forth.”—John 6: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Accordingly, to have Jehovah's favor and approval on ourselves and our families, and to expect our ministerial work to prosper, we must exercise faith—faith in the leadership of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom Jehovah sent forth. This faith will impel us to do the same work that Jesus did. He had faith in his Father, knowing that God was with him. Jehovah and Jesus Christ are more interested than we are in ourselves and in the Kingdom interests we are caring for. Consequently, we can be sure that God will prosper our work that is done in faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The work that we are doing during May to acquaint people with the meaning of the Bible book of Revelation is certainly backed fully by Jehovah, for he gave his Son the Revelation to John. We want everyone to hear this message, especially since it applies to the things taking place now and momentous things shortly to occur. Where we find feast we can confidently expect. When we think in terms of the overall activity of this 1970 service year, all of us are saying to ourselves, &quot;What increases!” and, “How fast the time is going!” Let us make good use of the time remaining to aid as many as possible to become men of goodwill. Let us help them to attend one of the “Men of Goodwill” District Assemblies. Abounding with you in Joy, we remain</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers making disciples, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">those who will read with faith, we will be bringing them happiness, as John himself wrote.—Rev. 1: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Then Is Finished the Mystery of God”</span><span class="font11"> should therefore be offered with full confidence. Why? It is really God who draws people. (John 6:44) Assuredly his spirit is strong in the understanding supplied by the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Mystery”</span><span class="font11"> book. Keep in mind that we are searching for persons who have some desire in their hearts to worship God, persons whose mental inclination is toward spiritual things. Jehovah has shown through the leading of his people during the past years that he knows exactly </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">what is needed</span><span class="font11"> at just </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the right time</span><span class="font11"> to influence the minds of men and he knows best because he created man. We would never know in our own wisdom what to say or do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> During the first eight months of this service year, and especially during April, thousands of persons have taken up Jehovah’s service, and a great number of these have been baptized. These good-hearted persons hope to survive the “great tribulation” that will soon befall this system of things, as emphasized in tlie </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font11"> book. Many are still studying the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. What better opportunity to help them additionally to get the stronger “meat” of God’s Word than by taking them along with us in presenting this book on Revelation to the people and taking them on studies that we start in this publication?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The apostle Paul says: &quot;Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please him well, for he that approaches God must believe that he Is and that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">he becomes the rewarder </span><span class="font11">of those earnestly seeking him.” (Heb. 11:6) By Christian works along with faith we can confidently expect to be rewarded with a prosperous ministry, as well as being blessed by seeing Jehovah reward the honest-hearted persons whom we help.—Jas. 2: 20-23.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) Publisher returns in week, to find interested person has read first chapter and thumbed through other chapters. Publisher asks if he has seen picture on page 60. Both turn there and publisher briefly explains by asking questions to draw out householder. He recognizes that rider on white horse represents Christ Jesus. Calendar in background shows the time is October 1914. A sword, he acknowledges, represents war, which was raging at that time on an unprecedented scale. If food items were so short they had to be weighed out, what would this represent? Yes. food shortage or famine conditions. The next rider is readily recognized as symbolizing death. The coming of all of these from and after 1914 gives proof that we have entered the “time of the end.” Interested one is fascinated by this discussion. Publisher turns to page 37, and suggests that they consider vision in more detail. Introduces question booklet and study is started.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Why do some brothers always seem to have good experiences in witnessing to fellow employees, schoolmates, business contacts, etc.? The answer lies in being alert to speak the truth at every appropriate opportunity. They just want to speak out what is in their hearts, hoping that those who hear may be prospective “sheep.” Select a few of the following experiences from the “Yearbook” to illustrate opportunities and results. Traveling: See pp. 188, par. 1; 231, par. 6, and 263, par. 2. To fellow workers: See pp. 86, par. 2; 141, par. 6; 213, par. 4, and 249, par. 3. In waiting room: See p. 182, par. 3. Ask audience for other opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">17 min: Presenting the June Offer. (Demonstration)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman: Again have privilege of offering “New World Translation” and “Word of God” book. What a fine combination this proved to be when offered in December! Publishers may use any method in presenting offer, but following presentation or variation may be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) (After greeting and giving name) “Im making brief visits on my neighbors to show them one of the most popular and helpful Bible translations published today. [Show Bible.] Most people tell us, when we show them this Bible, that they already have a Bible. Likely you do, too. [Let householder answer.] We are not here as Bible salesmen, to sell you just another Bible, but we would like you to obtain this modern up-to-date, translation and this Bible-study ate-that goes with it. The two go together so you will have the means in your home to understand the Bible. Both are only $1.25.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even before householder replies to offer, publisher could continue at this point, inquiring sincerely, “Do you find sometimes, In reading the Bible, questions come to mind? [Likely the answer will be Yes.] In fact, some •wonder if the Bible is really the Word of God. Possibly you have heard statements made by prominent clergymen, casting doubt on the Bible. [Allow for response.] But here is where this book will be of much help. Here is proof positive that the Bible is really the Word of God. It will help you see from the Bible that God has not forgotten mankind upon the earth and how you (and your family) can share in the wonderful future he has promised. This modern-language Bible and the book can be yours.” (Extend to householder.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) The above presentation could be varied according to what you find best in your territory. After same opening, and proceeding to point where mention is made that some clergymen are doubting the Bible, you could say: “Did you know the same was true in Jesus’ day? [Allow for response.] Looking here in the concordance of the ‘New World Translation’ under ‘Word of God’ we find the first reference takes up what Jesus said about some of the religious leaders of his day. [Read Mark 7:13.] Just a few verses earlier he said . . . [read vss. 7, 8]. But how should the Bible be viewed? Jesus, in praying to Go(l in behalf of his followers, said . . . [read John 17:17]. The Bible, then; contains the words of truth. Moreover, its words are life-giving, since it points the way to everlasting life. We invite you to accept the ‘New World Translation,’ which we have been reading from and this companion Bible-study aid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman concludes encouraging all to prepare well and buy out the time to share regularly in the house-to-house work with the offer. 12 min: Concluding comments. Include discussion of Question Box. Song 77.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a fine month March proved to be! With a total of 374,878 publishers and pioneers in the field preaching, we have reached our third peak in proclaimers of the good news so far this service year. This is an increase of 8.7 percent over last March. Regular pioneers are now at the highest level that they have ever been, and vacation pioneers are more than double the number reporting last March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Particularly is It noteworthy that we reached 6 back-calls per publisher. Evidently many more are reaching out for the opportunity to conduct a Bible study. What will be the resuiti-in April? We all wait anxiously to see!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>REVELATION-DOES IT MAKE YOU HAPPY?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font12">F YOU paused to name your reasons for happiness, what would you include? Knowledge of Jehovah, companionship with fellow Christians, your family . . . Yes, you’d probably have quite a list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But would you include your understanding and use of the book of Revelation? ‘What do you mean?’ you may wonder. The apostle John was inspired to write in the opening words of Revelation: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written in it; for the appointed time is near.” (Rev. 1:1, 3) Don’t you think that receiving the visions of Revelation thrilled John? Surely! But what about us? Though John could not have understood all that he wrote, we have Biblical and historical proof that today “the appointed time is near.” Consequently, what is in Revelation can make us happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is an especially pertinent matter during the month of May, for we will be offering the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God”</span><span class="font12"> in the ministry, as well as having our regular study in it at the congregation book study. Let’s examine our personal outlook toward Revelation and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book; our happiness is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How do you react to the idea of placing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book in the ministry during May? Likely you’ll agree that we should try to leave a copy with those with whom we study and others on whom we call regularly. But are you a bit reluctant about placing the book from house to house? Do you think that you will place more copies of some other book during May than the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book? Of course, each Witness can leave with a householder whatever literature he thinks best for that one, be it the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font12">book or something else. But before you conclude what you will try to do in May, consider these points:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">They Want to Understand</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first is that many persons are truly &gt;&nbsp;interested in learning more about Revelation. They have heard about it, such as about the “horsemen of the Apocalypse.” Yet undoubtedly they do not know what the symbolic language means. One woman studied with Jehovah’s witnesses for a while, but did not make much progress. She attended the Kingdom Hall and heard a talk on Revelation. The overseer writes: “The woman was thrilled with the talk because she had always been interested in Revelation and had never been able to learn about it.” A Witness in California placed a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book and a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon” </span><span class="font12">book with a young man in the navy. The man later said: “I concentrated on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Babylon’ </span><span class="font12">book because it dealt with the book of Revelation, which was more interesting to me.” Now he is a brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Don’t you believe that there are persons in your territory like that, even though you may never have mentioned Revelation to them? It would be doing such ones a kindness to let them know that we have a book that explains, verse by verse, over half of Revelation and that discusses the remaining chapters in a condensed form (chapter 24). At least offer it to them. You may be surprised to find that some people will accept a book on Revelation though they would not take one on another subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">They Need to Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The second point we have in mind is that if persons are going to gain eternal life they need to know many of the very things considered from Revelation in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery” </span><span class="font12">book. What we mean is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If someone is going to live forever, it is essential that he get to know Jehovah God. Does not Revelation chapter four, by presenting a vision of God’s holiness and glory, help one to do that? To live in the new order one must appreciate God’s Son. Revelation chapter five deals with Jesus and his worthiness to be used by God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A person needs to grasp the meaning of the troubles since 1914 and see that they point to the establishment of God’s kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. Doesn’t the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery” </span><span class="font12">book cover that in explaining the sixth and</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">twelfth chapters of Revelation? To understand the Bible one needs to see how the heavenly and earthly classes fit into God’s arrangement. If one is disgusted with immoral conditions, including what the churches permit, he needs to know that there is an organization that stresses moral cleanness, yes, requires it of its members. The new book shows that, when handling the second and third chapters of Revelation. And though the new book does not deal with a great many of the common doctrinal matters, it delivers a strong blow to the Trinity.—Pages 177, 187189.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is interesting that we received a numbei' of letters from non-Witnesses who got the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font12"> book. The book pleased and impressed them. These persons read it rapidly, not lingering on details, and they learned major points, such as the identity of “Babylon the Great” and God’s view of the churches. We feel that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book, in the same way, will help persons to see things that they need to know in order to gain life, don’t you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One final point is that placing the new book, during May, will help persons in our territory to see certain things about Jehovah’s witnesses that they ought to realize. For example, they ought to realize that Jehovah’s witnesses deal with solid and complicated portions of the Bible, not just the “milk” of the Word. (Heb. 5:12-14) Such deep material is usually shunned by the churches. Don’t you agree that if we place the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery<sup>3</sup>’</span><span class="font12"> book with persons they will recognize this difference between Jehovah’s organization and the churches?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As we share in the ministry during May, we can keep in mind these points about the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book and the people in our territory. Then as we leave with persons the explanation of Revelation found in the new book, it will be a way in which Revelation makes both us and them happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness Through Knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">and Understanding</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As Jehovah’s witnesses we are intensely interested in Revelation, for we recognize that since 1914 we have been living in the “Lord’s day.” (Rev. 1:10) Using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font12"> book, we studied the final nine chapters of Revelation verse by verse, and now we are doing the same in our congregation book studies with the thirteen chapters covered in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book. We believe that the more knowledge and understanding of Revelation we get, the greater will be our happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But there are many, many important prophetic details in the book. It would be easy for one, without realizing it, to concentrate on the details and still miss the marvelous overall picture. However, Revelation is not a disjointed collection of dissimilar visions of beasts, trumpets and so forth. Rather it is a smooth progression of connected parts that blend together and build up to a stunning climax. One brother who had a fairly good knowledge of the meaning of various individual symbols and visions in the book was helped to see the beautiful unity and progressive development of Revelation. He was so moved and happy with the knowledge and understanding gained that he exclaimed: “It’s as if I’ve been blind for twenty years and at last can see!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There follows herein a summary of Revelation from this overall viewpoint. It does not provide all the details or prophetic meanings, but it should deepen appreciation for the broad scope and harmony of the book. Reaa it, observing how the various chapters connect. Note that often one point in Revelation concludes by leading into the next, which expands and explains what was just considered. Sometimes a matter is mentioned only briefly in one chapter and later taken up and discussed in detail. We truly believe that considering this summary will make the sections of Revelation that you have already studied much more meaningful and moving for you, and that it will aid you as you continue to study the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Summary of Revelation</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The book of Revelation is in letter form, written about 96 C.E. by the apostle John to “seven congregations” in Asia Minor, representing all the congregation of anointed Christians. The introduction (1:1-3) identifies God as the source and Jesus as the channel for the Revelation. It assures happiness for those who hear and observe the words of the prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After mentioning Jehovah, the spirit and Jesus, John introduces himself and indicates that what follows pertains particularly to “the Lord’s day” (since 1914), He has a vision of the glorious appearance of the resurrected ^Jesus, the channel for the entire book. Letters are to be written to seven congregations. (1:4-3:22) Knowing the spiritual condition of the anointed, Jesus provides commendation, counsel and warning. This should give us confidence that God trains those who will be heavenly kings over the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Having seen the one who is the channel of the revelation, John next has a vision of its Author. (4:1-11) God is glorious and aweinspiring, deserving of our admiration and worship. Around God’s throne are cherubs that emphasize His qualities. And twenty-four older persons (the anointed as reigning in heaven) both worship the Creator and acknowledge that all creatures should do likewise. Jehovah has a sealed scroll, but who can open it?—5:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">John sees the Lamb, Jesus, take the scroll. Chapter five explains why Christ is worthy of this honor. So we should ascribe him honor and be interested in the scroll’s message about God’s purpose affecting heaven and earth in our day. Instead of just reading the scroll, John sees it in action. Christ begins to open the seven seals. The first reveals Jesus as a kingly ruler going forth to the final conquest. The second through the fourth depict by mounted horses the war, famine and extraordinary death since 1914 that have sent millions to Hades. With the breaking of the fifth seal, assurance is provided that God will avenge persecuted and martyred Christians. What John sees when the sixth seal is opened shows that there will be heavenly and earthly changes and that men will seek to be hid from the coming wrath of God.—6:1-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During an interval before the seventh seal is opened John sees what work has to be done before God allows the destructive storm of tribulation to come. (7:1-17) The completion of the work of sealing the 144,000 has to be accomplished. (Later in Revelation [14:1-3] it is shown as accomplished.) Also, holding back the destructive tribulation allows the “great crowd” to gain God’s approval and to worship him along with the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the seventh seal is broken and there is a brief period of prayei’ and preparation for what is to come. (8:1-6) Seven trumpets are to be sounded by seven angels (God’s earthly servants </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">began</span><span class="font12"> to deliver judgment messages at their conventions in 1922-1928). So in a series of seven seals, the final one widens out into a vision of seven other things (the trumpets); there is an orderly sequence of connected information. Five trumpet-like messages about elements of Satan’s organization are sounded. The fifth involves a plague of locust-like preachers; it is also said to be the first of three woes. When the sixth trumpet is sounded, comment is made about the releasing of those bound at the Euphrates, where ancient Babylon sat (the remnant were released from Babylonish captivity after World War I). Also the vision shows an army of 200,000,000 cavalry.—8:7-9:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is an interruption of the sixth trumpet; John sees an angel with a little, eatable scroll. (10:1-11) The apostle learns that in the days of the sounding of the seventh trumpet the mystery of God will be finished. Then he gets the scroll to eat and is told of additional prophesying work to be done. Yet there is more. He is to measure the spiritual temple, and he is told about witnesses who prophesied for a time (1914-1918), were killed by the wild beast and finally revived. So a wild beast is brought into the picture but not explained. The standing up to life of the witnesses precedes an earthquake in antitypical apostate Jerusalem, bringing to an end the sixth trumpet and the second woe.—11:1-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the sounding of the seventh trumpet an announcement is made about the established Kingdom (the “third woe” to God’s enemies). This results in wrathful persecution from the nations. (11:15-19) The next chapter explains more fully what happened. John sees God’s wifely organization give biith safely to the Kingdom, despite the Devil. There is war in heaven and Satan is cast down to earth, where he persecutes the remnant because of their faithfulness. (12:1-17) This gives warning of one great enemy, Satan. But other enemies come into view. One is the Devil’s beastly political organization out of the sea. It wars against Christians, who thus need endurance and faith. (13:1-10) Another enemy is the modern, dual political beast with two horns that encourages worship of the image of the sea beast.—13:11-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Will these enemies block the sealing of the 144,000? No! John sees the 144,000 happily singing on Mount Zion. (All of this is still under the seventh trumpet.) Then notice is given that there is trouble ahead for the enemies. An angel declares that God will execute judgment, hence he commands: “Fear God and give him glory.” A second angel announces that Babylon the Great has fallen. A third promises torments for worshipers of the beast oi' its image. Other angels foretell a reaping and announce a crushing at Armageddon.—14:1-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After these judgments and preliminary announcements John sees seven angels with seven plagues. This is under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, so again one series merges into the next. Despite the persecution many come off victorious and they sing praises. The seven angels will pour out bowls of anger, which point out God’s view of various world conditions and the results or effects of his judicial opinion. As with the sixth trumpet, the sixth bowl involves the Euphrates (Babylon). Mention is made also of the gathering to Armageddon, but details are not yet given. With the seventh bowl a voice says, “It has come to pass!” and Babylon is shaken apart and falls.—15:1-16:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Revelation now begins to explain the destruction of Babylon and to show the results. She is likened to a harlot riding upon a scarlet-colored beast with ten horns, it being an eighth king springing from the preceding seven. An angel says that in time the horns will battle with the Lamb, but no details are here given. The ten horns are shown turning on the harlot and destroying her. (17:1-18) Individuals are urged to get out of Babylon the Great before that happens. After she is destroyed kings and merchants miss her, but heaven rejoices. Her destruction is complete and final. (18:1-24) God is to be praised for executing this judgment. It is especially a source of joy to the Lamb’s bride (whose marriage began in 1918) for she has proved victorious over the harlot.—19:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the thread of Armageddon and those who fight against the Lamb is taken up again and expanded. Both organizations and individuals meet their end at Armageddon. (19: 11-21) What about the heavens? Satan is next cast into the abyss for a thousand years. For that period Christ and the 144,000 will be kings and priests in a special sense. Jumping quickly to the end of the thousand years to show Satan’s complete end, the vision depicts his loosing and the rebellion of some humans. Together they are cast into the lake of fire. (20:1-10) Moving back to describe events during the Millennium, the vision shows the dead as resurrected and being judged as worthy of eternal life or of death. -20:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the old heaven and earth fled away, John sees a new heaven and earth, as well as the blessings that these bring to humankind. He also sees a city, not Babylon, but Christ’s bride. It is holy and perfect, with a river of watei’ of life flowing from it. Abundant provisions are made for life. With this glorious, climactic picture of the governing organization of the new system the series of visions of Revelation concludes.—21:1-22:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">John is overwhelmed emotionally and wants to worship the agent who communicated the vision; but he is reproved. The prophecy is not to be sealed. Hearers of it are to invite others to take life’s waters free. No one should add to or take away from the scroll. Jesus again reminds readers that he is coming quickly. John responds, and concludes with a benediction upon the holy ones.—22:8-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Brothers, with this summary before you, why not quickly go through Revelation, perhaps striving to read it at one sitting. We feel it will aid you to get the overall sense and significance of the prophecy. The summary should help you as you study the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Mystery”</span><span class="font12"> book in the congregation study, producing happiness. And that happiness will even be multiplied during May by distributing the book in the ministry. In regard both to ourselves and to those with whom we place the new book we can expect fulfillment of the assurance about Revelation: “Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.”—Rev. 22:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Strengthen the weak hands, you people, and make the knees that are wobbling firm.” (Isa. 35:3, 4) This is what is needed in rendering help to those new ones who have just rtegun to share in the field service in March and April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Arranging to give assistance cannot be left to chance. Those who have conducted studies with new publishers should continue to help them, taking one progressive step after another until they are walking without “wobbling” in Jehovah’s service. Help them to prepare for the service and then make definite appointments to take them with you into the ministry. If they get results and have joy in the ministry, they will want to go again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Overseers should check regularly to see if new publishers as well as others who may be faced with some discouragement or problems in the ministry are receiving the assistance they need. Periodically, it would be good to sit down with each book study servant and go over the spiritual needs of each one in the group and review how help can best be given. Personal visits to the homes of families and individual publishers help to build their spirituality.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Book study servants, do you in reflecting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ability</span><span class="font11"> also demonstrate </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">dependability</span><span class="font11"> in doing your part in the shepherding of the flock?

<p><span class="font10">♦ District assembly lapel cards in English and Spanish may be ordered by overseers. Wearing these to the assembly will contribute to advertising en route and at the convention city. Lapel cards are not obtainable at the book counters at assemblies. Lapel cards are 1c each and celluloid holders are 5c each. There will be no bumper signs this year. Pioneers should bring their cafeteria tickets with them and treat them as they would cash, since replacements will not be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Due to increasingly perilous times, and so as not to invite thieves, it might be best not to advertise in the newspapers through press releases the names and addresses of brothers out of town attending an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Outlines for public talks delivered by circuit and district servants during the past few years are being sent to all congregations with the May written review.

Help others to work with you in lending a helping hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do you enjoy a cheerful, upbuilding visit from someone you know well? We all do, especially when the visit is by one of our brothers and when we need a little encouragement, or when we have been ill. Even though we are very busy, let us not neglect to visit those who need our help. Perhaps at times what you do will not amount to much in your eyes, but to the one visited it will mean very much. It is reassurance that you care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>e</sup> There is one thing about giving in behalf of others—you usually get a richer blessing from this than the one receiving. Paul made reference to this principle enunciated by Jesus, at Acts 20:35, in discussing with overseers how, in following his example, they “by thus laboring . . . must assist those who are weak.” Have you noticed that the ones who are so generous in giving of their time and ability in assisting others are the ones who are the happiest? Increase your happiness by regularly looking for and using your opportunities to lend a helping hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The world’s &quot;Memorial Day’’ holiday comes on Saturday, May 30, this year. Where appropriate, special witnessing may be arranged at cemeteries; otherwise, congregations may find it advantageous to share in regular magazine day activity.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> By this time you have undoubtedly selected the convention you will attend this summer. If not, we urge you to do so now; and as you plan, be sure to include all FOUR.days. The program for each “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly is loaded with spiritual blessings from start to finish. We suggest that you plan to arrive in the convention city Wednesday evening. This will give you opportunity to get settled in your accommodations ahead of time. If this is not possible, schedule your arrival a couple of hours before noon on Thursday. Occasionally some have missed the opening talk because they were unable to get their noon meal and be in their seats by that time. Therefore allow </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">plenty</span><span class="font11"> of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To ensure having a place to stay, fill out the Room Request form very carefully and completely so the convention department will know the kind of accommodations you desire. The Room Request form should be mailed to the assembly city four to five weeks before the assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Can you volunteer to work at this assembly? As you know, there is a great deal of work to be done to take care of everyone’s needs at the convention city. Why not fill out a Volunteer Service slip designating the kind of work in which you desire to share? Give it to your congregation servant, who will send it to the convention city where you will be attending. Do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font11"> send it to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> To ensure Jehovah’s full smile of approval on all of us as we attend the assemblies, we all need to watch how we conduct ourselves. When we are a little tired or have to wait a few moments to be served, how refreshing it is to be with persons who manifest love and consideration! We should all endeavor to show these qualities. And what about the children? They need the loving supervision of their parents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Plan to be in your seat when each session starts and make every effort to stay for the united expression of thanks to Jehovah at the close of the day. It is good to be there so you can say “Amen&quot; to the closing prayer. We look forward with you to the many blessings Jehovah has in store for us at the assemblies this summer.</span></p></li></ul>

What will you do once placements are made? Interest has already been shown in the book, so it may be possible to direct the discussion toward a Bible study, either when the book is placed or on the back-call. The question booklet may be helpful to you in doing so.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Be positive about starting the study in this publication, even though it is more specialized than the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. We never know how and in what way the minds of individuals will be turned to the truth. A study of Revelation may be just what some people are looking for. When you place the book, if a particular point interests the householder, then this can be further developed on the back-call, leading into a Bible study.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The study can be started right in the first chapter, or elsewhere in the book.

Are you starting to plan your summer activities now with the thought of sharing fully in theocratic activities? For the young folks, school will be out in June, and this leaves two or three months for vacation pioneering. Vacations for most come at this time of the year too. In addition to attending one of the district assemblies during your vacation, can you serve as a vacation pioneer for a month or at least two weeks? What more exciting and beneficial way could you find for spending your vacation? And this would not have to cut out an occasional visit to the beach or other relaxation either. If care is not exercised, however, the whole summer can go by with activities supposedly for our own personal enjoyment being put first and with only a token amount of time being spent in the ministry.</span></p>

You could also mention that this publication is now being studied in neighborhood groups, and you could take up a few points discussed the week before at your book study group and then invite him over to join the study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Some of the things that may be posted on the information board are: service meeting program, ministry school schedule and assignments, schedule for cleaning the Kingdom Hall, letters from the Society that direct that they be posted, notice of the circuit servant’s visit and the schedule for publishers to work with the circuit servant, letters regarding the coming circuit assembly, monthly congregation field service report, schedules showing the public talks and the speakers for the coming months, assignments for those who will serve as chairman of the public lectures and the readers of &quot;The Watchtower,&quot; the congregation book studies in the congregation’s territory and the addresses and time of meetings, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The information board is not to be used for personal items such as &quot;shower&quot; announcements. Clippings should not be indiscriminately posted, but from time to time some selected ones may be deemed by the overseer to be appropriate to be put on the board for a few days. The information board should be neat and attractive. The overseer has supervision of the information board, and he should see that it is kept up-to-date.</span></p>

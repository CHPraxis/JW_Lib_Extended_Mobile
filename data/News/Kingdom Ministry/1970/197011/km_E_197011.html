<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)eaft ^Kingdom ^PuMislieftS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">There have been a lot of goodbyes said around Bethel in the past few weeks. On September 13 the 49th class of Gilead School graduated, and it was a wonderful day. Since then many of these good friends of ours have been leaving us. So every once in a while the lobby of the Bethel home has been crowded with people and someone in the center of all of them is getting ready to leave. And there have been some tears shed' But then the graduates leaving for their missionary assignments are taken to the airport and they fly away. Our love and prayers go with every one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No sooner are the graduates on their way than we begin to see a lot of new faces because another class is to begin on October 19. This is the 50th class of Gilead School. The students are from Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and &gt;&nbsp;other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We wish you could see the happy faces of these students. Some from foreign countries have remarked that they thought they would be homesick, but they have made new friends so rapidly here that they feel right at home. It is evident that coming to Gilead is a big experience in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is always a pleasure for us to hear experiences from these students. A married couple from the Netherlands told us how different it is witnessing now in southern Holland, where there are many Catholics. Whereas many used to say, “I have my church,” many now say in effect, “The church doesn’t interest me any more.” A number of the foreign students were able to witness to passengers on the airplane to New York. For example, two German students witnessed to a Jewish woman who had never talked with the Witnesses before. She told them: “You know so much about the Bible, but I do not even know much about the Old Testament, which I should know.” She said she would consider taking the six-month <sub>k</sub>. 3ibie study course.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Those Who Have Not Cooled Off</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Speaking of our day, Jesus said that “because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.” (Matt. 24:12) Today we see this fulfilled before our very eyes as more and more people world wide actually deny or else doubt the existence of God and commit acts of violence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus did not, however, say that the love of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> would cool off. The response world wide proves that there are still persons who have a love of righteousness, and contact with people in our own territories has convinced us that this is so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> All of this causes what reaction in us? Well, appreciating our own need to be on guard, we eagerly respond to Jehovah’s loving reminder that will be prominently before us during November: “You must not forget.” tDeut. 25:19) Also, we are glad for other Scriptural urglngs, such as those of Paul: &quot;Stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you.” “Be aglow with the spirit.” (2 Tim. 1:6; Rom. 12:11) The fact that the greater number have cooled off or forgotten God need not affect the warmth we feel toward Jehovah or the zeal we have for his service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">•* This will help us to have the right view of our house-to-house work. That view is not simply to endure the indifference of the greater number in the territory. No, Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We will have a Gilead class of only fifty this time because Bethel is so crowded. Rooms that we were using for Gilead students are now housing new members of the Bethel family. And they have come in here in great numbers in the last few weeks. Over a hundred new members of the Bethel family have recently arrived. So we must say that the home is filled with new faces and we are busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We send you our warm greetings and love, as we all work together, not forgetting Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Y’our brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">said we should ‘search out those who are deserving.’’ (Matt. 10:11) Later he said, “Make disciples . . . baptizing them . . . teaching them.” —Matt. 28:19, 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> But what of the one whose love has cooled off? Something you say might help him to learn to love again. Angry opposers have become mild-tempered publishers. Some are even mature overseers now. And, are there inactive ones in your congregation or even in your own family? Cool treatment is not the therapy. What a thrill if they begin to love again through your kind example and encouragement I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During November we will again have the opportunity to offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. We can also add some variety to this offer by using any bound book of our liking. There will be those who already have the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book and then we can offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution,</span><span class="font11"> Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of God, “Mystery,&quot; ‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> books. A free booklet is given with a 50c publication but not with the 25c publications, which, incidentally, .should be offered singly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Having already offered the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book a number of times in the house-to-house work, you may have your own favorite method of presenting it. We are happy that we can be flexible and decide personally what we think is best in presenting the message in harmony with our ability and the territory in which we work. One brother who has been working in a big city tells us that he has shortened his preliminary remarks. “I used to tell them my name, the name of my companion, the nature of our work, that we were calling on our neighbors and that the call would be brief,” he said. “I finally decided that, while this might be described as a normal introduction in many territories, it was too wordy for this territory where people are in a big hurry and not inclined to hear you out. Now I smile and get right to the point saying, ‘Good </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font11"> 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Searching for Those Who Have Not Cooled Off. (Matt. 24:12) Song 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Those Who Have Not Cooled Off.” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">14 min: From House to House with the “Truth” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman points out that we have been placing the “Truth” book for two years now and have had much experience. Yet we need to keep improving in our presentations so honest-hearted ones will be attracted to the truth. Don’t want to get stale or in a rut. Good to exchange ideas on what has been found successful in our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Ask audience what they have found especially effective since trying out suggestions given on last week’s service meeting. Does direct presentation of book work best? Have some used a sermon? Has Bible study folder been presented first? What works best in our territory? Let brothers contribute practical suggestions. Chairman might check with certain publishers in advance so they will be stimulated to contribute for the benefit of others. Following thoughts might then be considered. Where brevity is required, some have said, “Have you received your copy of the ‘Truth’ book yet? We leave it on a contribution of only 25c.” Thereafter, further words of description can follow, depending on the response. To get conversation started you might say: “You have probably heard people say, ‘It doesn’t matter what you believe, as long as you lead a clean moral life and deal kindly with your neighbors.’ Here is a book that shows what the Bible says on questions such as that.” If appropriate, turn to page 12, paragraph 4, and read a few<sup>T</sup> sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Have some well-rehearsed demonstrations, possibly including the suggestions given in the article “Those Who Have Not Cooled Oft.” Adapt all presentations to what is felt best for local territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman concludes by mentioning that each should select his own presentation on the basis of local territory and what publisher personally feels is appropriate. Encourage all to have full share in house-to-house work with “Truth” book this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">14 min: Starting Studies in the “Truth” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman show’s we are interested not only in placing “Truth” book, but in starting studies. Encourage publishers really to make advance preparations for starting studies on initial call. Many publishers say they have difficulty in finding people at home when in back-call work. Thus the more you can accomplish on the initial call, the better it may be. Depending upon your approach, might help to have tw<sup>T</sup>o separate goals in mind in house-to-house work with “Truth” book: Get book in householder's hands. Get study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Get comments from audience on what has been found effective in starting studies in “Truth” book. Chairman should talk to some capable publishers a week or so ahead of time so they will give thought to this and be prepared to contribute. Get ideas that have worked in local territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Have well-rehearsed demonstration or two on starting study in “Truth” book on initial call or return call. Brother who knows what is involved in starting studies should handle this part. Entire assignment should be well prepared so as to be truly helpful to publishers with something they can use immediately thereafter in territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Concluding thoughts by chairman. Review major points so they will be remembered by publishers. Highlight need to keep in mind goal of study w’hen in house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">9 min: Concluding comments: &quot;How Did We Do in September?” and local report for October. Song 57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK. STARTING NOVEMBER 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Help Your Family to Remember Jehovah. (Deut. 25:19) Song 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: ’Our Heartfelt Thanks.’ Enthusiastic discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: “Do It Now!” Questions and answers. Consider also “Appreciation for Bible Training by Parents,” in September 8, 1970, “Awake!,” page 7. Also draw out comments from parents and children on joy and benefits they derive from family study. See if some parents have especially effective ideas that make family study interesting and profitable. Talk to parents in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “The Blessing of a ‘Quiet and Mild Spirit’.” “Watchtower,” May 15, 1970. Talk. Can draw audience into discussion at times. Material applies to all in congregation. Parents can do much to develop these qualities in children during family study and at other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments. Include some appropriate Theocratic News items and Announcements. Song 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Share in the Ingathering. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) Song 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Branch Letter. Handle according to material and local needs. 15 min: Presenting the Good News —“Sharing in the Ingathering.” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Joyous Results When All Shared. This should tie in closely with preceding assignment. Discuss and apply a variety of experiences demonstrating how all in the congregation play a vital role in aiding newly interested ones to appreciate the truth and also in strengthening them. Chairman should prepare well the following reports and experiences and discuss them with the audience. Chairman can relate part of experience and read portions. Can have other brothers assist him in this. After each experience has been related to audience, questions should be asked as to what points we can learn from impressions people got of us. Can bring out points such as: All need to be prepared to participate in meetings; old and young should comment; use Bible freely; be friendly and outgoing-; best not to have extreme styles and habits; no race or other prejudice. Let audience make these applications. In conclusion chairman shows how all of us share in ingathering work if we watch our ... conduct wherever we are, attend meetings regularly, participate, take meeting assignments seriously, share regularly in field ministry. References: “Awake!,” 9/8/70, pp. 20-23; 8/22/70, p. 16, especially par. 7; 7/22/70, pp. 15, 23. Remember, purpose of discussion is not to boast concerning good impression we have given others, but to become more aware of our responsibility to help in the ingathering. Then we can rejoice in having had a share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Teaching All Nationalities with a View to Baptism. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Song 109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Teaching All Nationalities with a View to Baptism.” See December 1, 1970, “Watchtower.” Capable brother who does well in Bible study work might discuss material with a few publishers who regularly conduct Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “How Wise Is the Spirit of Competition?” “Watchtower,” June 15, 1970. Talk. Show that brothers need to be aware of being caught up in the spirit of competition in sports and secular work but must also beware of the same in congregation matters. There should be no spirit of competition in field service, platform assignments, knowledge, personal possessions, dress, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Offering the “New World Translation” and “Truth” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman talks of privilege we will have to present this offer ' throughout December. Preparation, however, is necessary. Have been offering “Truth” book in November and now will add “New World Translation.” Fine combination offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Discuss with audience some ideas for presenting offer that they feel can be successful in local territory. We have presented Bible number of times in the past. What works for you? Publishers can be encouraged to take notes of what they think will be ?:ood for them to use. Then can analyze oilowing presentation, after which it can be demonstrated by capable publisher. Make adjustments and additions according to local territory. “We are stopping at each home just briefly because we want people to have the opportunity to get acquainted with one of the finest Bible translations f&gt;ublished today. It uses present-day anguage that is easy to read and makes the meaning more clear. It can be obtained, in combination with this Bible study aid, for a contribution of just $1.25.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Discuss with congregation how to emphasize the free home Bible study in connection with the offer. Publishers find that offering to demonstrate the study before offering literature does not cut down on placements but often results in more studies. In conclusion encouragement is given to all to schedule time during December to have generous share in offering “New World Translation” and “Truth” book, teaching with a view to baptism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Could you please stop at our home and help me counsel my son?” asked a concerned father of the overseer. “He Is getting quite rebel-Jious and no longer wants to study come to the meetings.” This the ’overseer gladly did. He is pleased to make such a call or even further calls, when requested, and will do the best he can in offering sound Scriptural counsel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But are such calls by the overseer or other servants the real means of solving the problem? Or is there a better solution that all of us should have in mind and that will accomplish far more? The Bible gives the answer: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it”—Prov. 22: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Time</span><span class="font11"> is needed for such training. Cultivating in a son a deep love for Jehovah, as well as aiding him to become a person capable of shouldering responsibility in the congregation and one effective in the field ministry, is not accomplished primarily by a servant’s offering occasional counsel, even though such is entirely appropriate at times and contributes greatly to the training process. Bringing a son to this position is a long-term job, accomplished by persistent application over a period of many years, it is a day-to-day bresponsibility. (Deut. 6:7) Living , n the same home with the child, •Seeing what he does, hearing what he says, knowing what he is thinking, the parents are in the best position to do the training.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Then there is the matter of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">responsibility.</span><span class="font11"> Jehovah has placed this responsibility on the shoulders of the parents, not the servants or others in the congregation. While others can assist, yet they must be careful not to usurp the authority of the parents, circumventing the family arrangement outlined in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">September was the month we concentrated on offering the “Evolution&quot; book throughout the territory and in the schools. The brothers did excellently, placing 922,199 books. This number is second only to August of 1969 when we placed 936,913 and the offer was the &quot;Truth” book. What a testimony was given to the fact of creation by Jehovah as against the theory of evolution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Scriptures. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp'’</span><span class="font11"> book, page 185.) In fact, it is best for servants to counsel children in the presence of their parents. Ephesians 6:4 says, “And you, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” If the father is not a believer, then the responsibility to teach the children God’s Word falls on the mother. Training should begin in infancy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Are your children receiving these God-ordained benefits? Can you name the evening and the hour when the family study is scheduled? Can your children? If you have not set in motion whatever arrangements are necessary to ensure that your child will get the teaching, training and attention that are needed, then undoubtedly It would be best to DO IT NOW!—Prov. 19:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The atmosphere in which the study is conducted is important. Try to cultivate a cheerful, warm, receptive attitude on the part of all. Rather than have a rigid, stern study session, why not have a relaxed, cooperative family gathering where all can helpfully contribute and participate, assisting one another? The family study should be a delightful session that all look forward to.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Those . . . Not Cooled Off </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">morning. I have been asking people’s opinion regarding the big changes in religion. I would appreciate your thoughts. What do you think is the reason many of the young ones no longer are interested in religion?’ Most people already know I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. By getting right to the point I have gotten many involved in a conversation where I had not been successful before. Of course, in other instances I go through the introductory formalities that some expect.” Each publisher should decide what is best for him, but we should be alert to adjust our presentations in accord with what is developing in our territory and in the world in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> In addition to the house-to-house work, there will be many other opportunities to present the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book. Those who are alert to the opportunities to do incidental witnessing find the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book an ideal publication to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Are you glad that you are one toward whom Jehovah is showing concern and whom he reminds, “You must not forget”? Are you glad that there are still some in your territory whose love of righteousness has not entirely cooled off? Are you glad that even cooled-off ones might still</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">’Our Heartfelt Thanks'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is what our Peruvian brothers in the earthquake area are saying to Jehovah and his organization for all the things sent to them. A call for clothing went out to the congregations in New York city. Out of the 20,000 pounds of clothing that arrived duty free, there was enough for all the brothers and sisters and their children in the earthquake area. Exclamations such as these were heard: “How loving on the part of our brothers!” “Our brothers have stripped themselves just to cover us!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Money contributions sent to Peru from brothers in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and other lands totaled about $3,000. This was in addition to the $20,000 made available by the Society. This relief fund is enabling the brothers to get what they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The material aid sent to our brothers in Peru has impressed many outsiders. As various items piled up in front of the ruins of a Kingdom Hall, a neighbor commented : “I understand that you people don’t pay tithes, and yet your organization brings you all these things so quickly. We pay tithes in our church and nobody even remembers us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Peru are deeply grateful. As the branch servant reports: “From the very first it was the promptness on the part of the brothers that impressed and encouraged the stricken ones. The indescribable gift of help and the fruitage of love sent to the brothers in Peru has had the desired effect, for the time spent in the ministry among the brothers in the earthquake zone has not diminished one iota. To the contrary, all activity has increased.” A fine way indeed to express heartfelt thanks!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing in the Ingathering</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The outstanding numerical increases that have taken place world wide in the theocratic organization in recent years have been a stimulus and encouragement to all of us. Jehovah is surely fulfilling his promise to bring into his earthly organization those who love the truth. But how many disciples have you personally made recently? It could lie few or none at all. After all, when we average out the number of persons that come into the organization in one year, there are not very many in each congregation. Even then, one publisher might help an entire family to learn the truth, so only one or two publishers in a certain congregation have this joy of starting new publishers in the field ministry. How, then, is it possible for the rest of us to have any share in the ingathering?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Most of us have a part in the house-to-house work. We present the various literature offers. We distribute tlie magazines. Not only do we leave literature explaining the Bible but we have Scriptural discussions. We leave a good impression.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, when Witness families set a good example in Christian conduct this is observed by neighbors. The father who shoulders his responsibilities in a fine way is respected at his place of secular employment and in the community. When the mother is diligent in carrying out her duties in the household and when the children are obedient, loving and law-abiding in school, at home and in the neighborhood, the neighbors come to know it. This is a living witness to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> So, after a time a publisher calls at a home in the regular house-to-house work and there is interest and a study can lie started and rapid progress is made. Who is to receive the credit? Actually, as we have seen, many in the congregation have contributed. And, can we overlook the part the angels have played? Finally, who really makes it grow?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Then there comes the time when the interested one attends his first meeting. This is a critical point in his advancement. If you are the publisher bringing him to the Kingdom Hall, what thoughts are now going through your mind? Well, you hope that many of the publishers will be there early so you can introduce him to some of them before the meeting. You hope they will all show their usual friendliness, not being too occupied with other things. You hope that the brothers and sisters with assignments on the Ministry School will be very well prepared and give clear, understandable, enthusiastic talks. You hope that the brothers who have service meeting parts are thoroughly prepared and will present instructive, helpful material. If it is the public talk, you hope that the brother does well, with the best of material and a poised, conversational delivery. For the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study you hope that the publishers’ response will be Quick and their comments enlightening and upbuilding..</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Why do you hope for these things? Because you want the publishers and the program to help you in assisting your student to make progress. Have you ever sat through a meeting, knowing that someone new was in the audience and listened to the program “through his ears”? What a satisfied feeling you had when the program was outstanding 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ So we all can share in assisting new ones. In fact, it is a responsibility we cannot escape. When each member of the congregation plays his part, all share in the ingathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do it Now! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Conl’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Why is all of this so important now? Satan does not want anyone to serve Jehovah. (1 Pet. 5:8) He has many ways of putting pressure on the young ones in an attempt to make them fall. The things of the world are made to look so enticing. There is the fear of ridicule by classmates, and the desire to be accepted by others. For many hours each week while at school they are away from godly parental influence and under worldly influence. Only parents who truly appreciate the seriousness of this and who understand that they are engaged in a battle for the minds of their offspring will really succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Rearing children today is not an easy matter. It requires a great deal of thought and planning on the part of devoted parents. But the rewards are worth it!</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question. dSox</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">♦ How many copies of “Kingdom Ministry&quot; should a congregation receive?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">“Kingdom Ministry&quot; is not for general distribution. As the name implies, it contains help and encouragement for those who share in the field ministn’ The congregation should receive eno copies of rCingdom Ministry&quot; so tha<sup>4 </sup>all who qualify can have one. How is the figure arrived at? Add the total number of publishers, regular and irregular, to the number of pioneers associated with the congregation. To this add the names of all others who attend the service meetings with some regularity and who give indication that they want to share in the field ministry and are making some progress in that direction. There should be one for the Theocratic Ministry School library and one for the congregation file kept by the congregation servant, in addition to the congregation servant’s personal copy. This total is then rounded off to the next multiple of eight, inasmuch as “Kingdom Ministry&quot; is sent in groups of eight, and this makes copies available to care for growth in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some congregation servants have found it advantageous to have a list of those who qualify to receive a copy of &quot;Kingdom Ministry.” When the month’s supply arrives, the names of these persons are written neatly on their copies and distributed to them through the book study servants. A brother who sets a good example in the congregation can be assigned to assist in this. In this way each one is assured of getting his copy. Knowing that extra copies for replacement are not available, each one should take care of the one provided for him. Many publishers find it useful to save “Kingdom Ministry” for future reference.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Go therefore and make disciples . . . baptizing them.“——Matt. 28:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Q)ea/i ^Kingdom OubCisk/is: </span><span class="font9">Since the earthquakes in Peru, Brother Knorr told the Bethel family that all of the missionaries in Peru are safe and well. Immediately after it was learned how great the disaster was, the congregations in Lima gathered together clothing, food and money and they took approximately seven tons of supplies to the stricken area. Just as soon as the highway was opened, three cars and a truck loaded with material went through to Casma, where there are 20 publishers. All of the buildings were shaken down and there was a pile of rubble. Supplies were left with a special pioneer foj^distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The caravan of four vehicles traveled on to Chlmbote, where there is a population of 250,000. We have three congregations there of about I 300 brothers. All of the homes were destroyed, and two Kingdom Halls were demolished. One Kingdom Hall had a cement floor, so the first thing the brothers did was to clear off the rubble and put up a mat wall, and Tuesday night they had their congregation book study there. The brothers bringing supplies arrived there Wednesday morning at 9 a.m. Shortly thereafter missionaries from Trujillo came from the north to Chimbote with more assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are several towns in the Andes that could not be reached for eight days after the earthquake. But our brothers loaded two vans with supplies and were the 15th and 16th cars to get to Huaraz. What joy was expressed! They said, “We did not expect you so soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The New York city brothers responded quickly and generously contributed far more clothing than is needed. We have already made two shipments of clothing to Peru and the Society has also provided $20,000 for the branch to use in obtaining whatever is required on the part of our brothers. We are confident that our fellow workers in this stricken area will certainly bring much comfort to those who</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What a Loving Provider!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Isn’t It reassuring to reflect on the many provisions that Jehovah constantly makes for us? How numerous they are! For example, we regularly enjoy an abundance of appetizing spiritual food in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> We have five upbuilding meetings each week and we have a splendid organization to coordinate our preaching efforts. Also we have the loving oversight and the helpful direction of our servants and family heads; and every year we have two enjoyable circuit assemblies in addition to a district, national or international assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> This year it is the “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly. The very name is exciting, isn’t it? By the time you receive this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> you may well have attended your district assembly. If not, bend every effort to get there and help others in the congregation are distressed, by telling them the message of God’s kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">We have also been told that brothers in Cameroun have been expelled from that country because they refuse to vote. So the missionaries there have been sent to other assignments. The Society received word June 6 from Madagascar that someone there is trying to expel 20 missionaries too. So troubles come to God's people in more ways than one, but still the preaching of this good news of the Kingdom for a witness will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No matter where God’s people are they look to Jehovah God as their overseer and teacher and they are confident that he will direct them in the service that he has assigned them to do in these &quot;last days.” All of us should persevere in prayer and be of good courage, knowing that we come under the care of our Father in heaven who blesses all with the necessities of life as they continue to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your brothers and fellow servants, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Bbanch Office </span><span class="font9">to be in attendance. You will be glad that you did.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> It is true that living conditions have really become much more difficult in recent years. This alone has had its effect on many of us. Secular work has become far more demanding and oppressive for some. Inflation is taking its toll. Some of our brothers are working longer hours each day just to make ends meet, and yet amidst these deteriorating conditions we all need to keep our balance, doh’t we? What loving provisions Jehovah has made for us so we may endure! By providing the regular meetings and special assemblies he arranges for us to be assembled together to be built up spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Our loving Provider has also given us wonderful equipment to use in the field ministry during July. We will b’e presenting the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot; </span><span class="font9">book, even as we did during May. Its message is forceful and timely. No doubt you had fine experiences with this publication during May and enjoyed presenting it. As a suggestion, why not review the supplement to the May </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font9">now. You will find this information motivating and it will refresh your mind with ideas on presenting the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery&quot;</span><span class="font9"> book with clarity and enthusiasm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> .Sharing as we do in a most urgent work, our schedules are usually very full, and at times we may feel the need to get away and “rest up a bit,” as Jesus and his apostles did. (Mark 6:30, 31) If you plan to take a vacation in connection with attending one of the assemblies, or at some other time, we hope that you will have a fine time. Being away from our regularly scheduled work for a few days is good for our minds and bodies. It can do much to help restore vital physical and emotional energy, and there is no reason to criticize yourself if you do this sometime during the year.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">WEEK STARTING JULY 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Reflecting God’s Love. (1 John 4:16-19) Song 81.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Jehovah, an Awe-Inspiring yet Loving God. Talk by mature brother highlighting Jehovah’s love and other marvelous qualities, based on article In March 15, 1970, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “What a Loving Provider!” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Making the Most of Our Opportunities. Talk and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Chairman: Summer provides ideal time to have full share in field service. Why? There are more hours of daylight and we can extend witnessing into the evening, when most people are home from work and in a relaxed frame of mind. Many congregations need men to take lead. Why not call at time most favorable to get men interested in the truth. One brother who is an overseer and pioneer stated: ‘After supper the people are more relaxed. Women are not afraid to open the door, because their husbands are at home. Tn this way we are able to start studies with whole families and these can be held on Sunday or in the evening.’ He also remarked that the evening is ‘the best time for the ministry.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(6 mln.) Two book study servants discuss evening witnessing. One discusses local obstacles and attitudes. Other patiently refutes arguments, pointing out people more receptive, man of house at home, find persons who seldom if ever have had a full opportunity to hear the good news, have realization of thoroughly covering territory by making not-at-homes in evening, may start study with entire families. An hour in evening may be worth two or three at other times. Evening hours produce placements, back-calls and Bible studies. Other brother begins to get enthusiastic as discussion continues. He finally decides to talk up evening witnessing at next book study. The two discuss now to have a share in evening witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Chairman: Suggests working together in evenings where advisable. Any who cannot share in evening witnessing, yet want to spend more time in the field, may spend a full day in service from time to time. Organize according to local circumstances. Those taking care of midweek witnessing arrangements can encourage spending a full day in service. For example, if group spends two or three hours in house-to-house ministry in the mornings, why not spend another hour or two in the afternoons making not-at-homes, back-calls or conducting studies. Always enjoyable and mutually beneficial to get together with vacation and regular pioneers. Asks audience how many would like to try spending a full day in service if it were organized so that many could encourage one another. Suggests those handling midweek witnessing and book study servants arrange for groups to spend full day in service where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3 min: Accounts report. Briefly commend congregation for material support of Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 mln: Concluding comments. Cover June report for congregation, “How Did We Do in May?” and slogan on page 4. Song 92.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">10 min: Book study servant calls on irregular meeting attender to encourage meeting attendance, using day’s text and Theocratic News. These two may introduce other parts on the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Unprecedented Opportunities.” Talk and audience discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Christianity, a Way of Life. A mature brother should handle this part, making it interesting and lively, drawing out the answers from as many different ones in the audience as possible. The Bible may be used to establish Scriptural answers to questions. All are free to use the “Aid” and “Make Sure” books in addition to other reference material. How and when did Christ’s followers come to be called Christians? (ad, p. 316; g67 7/22, p. 27) For what reasons is this name appropriate? (g67 7/22, p. 28) Why are true Christians today called Jehovah’s witnesses? (g67 7/22, p. 28; ms. pp. 81, 270) Show Scripturally that calling oneself a Christian does not make it so. (ms, pp. 83, 84. 98) Why was Christianity called “The Wav”? Why was this name Atting, and what other names appropriately describe followers of Christ? (ad, p. 316; w64, pp. 615, 616) How was early Christianity viewed by the world of that time? (ad, p. 317; li, pp. 191, 192; qm, pp. 276-278) What similarities are there between the early Christian congregation and true Christian witnesses of Jehovah today? (qm, pp. 283-287) What differences are there between Jehovah’s Christian witnesses and so-called Christians today? (Consider conduct and doctrines, ms, pp. 78-83, 270-281) What does it mean to be a Christian? (ad, pp. 316, 317; w68, pp. 230, 231)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Encourage brothers to keep busy in ministry during summer. Remind all to send in field reports if vacationing at end of month. Song 32.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Theme: Keep Watching How You Are Building. (1 Cor. 3:10) Song 70.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">12 min: Sharing Fully in the House-to-House Ministry. Talk using scriptures from “Make Sure,” pp. 277-280, local experiences highlighting importance, and practical discussion of local</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">4 needs. Build up appreciation for privilege of having regular, weekly shai€ in this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Also handle appropriate Announcements and consider local experiences in placing the “Mystery” book. Song 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">WEEK STARTING JULY 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be well to give further emphasis to house-to-house ministry on this meeting by frankly discussing what hinders some from having a greater share in this work and outlining how these problems can be overcome. If there is no need to prepare a fifth meeting, because of attending an assembly, you may adjust the program according to local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Deep Appreciation for Jehovah’s Sacred Things. (Ps. 27:4) Song 82.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May was another wonderful month in the ministry in many ways. W’hen the report was being tabulated in the office we thought for a while there would be another new peak, surpassing even April’s high point in publishers. While that did not occur, the total of 379,238 publishers continues to be well over our 10-percent goal for the year and it really makes our hearts rejoice to see your zeal and devotion to Jehovah. Also the average magazines placed per publisher, 14.5, and the average hours, 10.8, give some indication of the public’s desire to read information that really contains some hope for the future and of your zeal in making it available to them. Surely *• Jehovah has blessed us with grand privileges as we go on with our vital work of making disciples to His praise.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Unprecedented Opportunities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Have you noticed how worsening world conditions have made it more ^favorable to discuss the truth with eople these days? It is true that many do not listen to our message, but that only proves that the dividing work is getting accomplished. (Matt. 25:31-46) And we rejoice to see this, don’t we? But what happens when we meet those who are inclined toward righteousness? Do they not show that they are anxious to talk to us and that they want answers to their questions? Really, these are days of unprecedented opportunities for witnessing about Jehovah’s kingdom. How happy we can be that we live in such times!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Wisely our heavenly Father Jehovah has provided the house-to-house ministry as the most effective means of searching out deserving ones. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lamp&quot;</span><span class="font9"> book points out on page 85: “This is a ■ type of work that fits the capabilities of each one of us, because it involves talking to just one or two persons at a time, and, at the same time, it is the best way to be sure that no one hungering and thirsting for righteousness is overlooked.”—Matt. 5: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> However, some circuit and district servants in different parts of the country tell us that support for the house-to-house work is decreasing, and especially so over the weekends. Why is this, brothers? Are some of us losing appreciation for this facet of our ministry? Have we forgotten Paul’s words at Acts 20: 20 regarding teaching from house to house? Are we overlooking the fact that the best way to reach people is by calling at their doors?—Matt 10:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> It is true that the preaching work is done under angelic direction, and how busy the angels must be in directing the work today! (Matt 24: 31; Rev. 14: 6, 7) But the question is, Are we individually having a full share In this work? Just think of the blessing we would miss if we did not take full advantage of the house-to-house ministry, especially when we know that this work is fully supported by Jehovah and his holy angels. (1 Cor. 3:9) Certain knowledge of this fact should infuse us with such courage and zeal that no obstacle, regardless of size, will be able to slow us down or stop us from pressing on with the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Most of us want to engage in the house-to-house work. We have the right motive with regard to Jehovah and sheeplike ones. Some may feel &lt;&nbsp;reluctant to engage in it, though, because of not being sure of what to say. If you feel this way about it, why not make an appointment with your book study servant or any other servant so you can enjoy this fine privilege. If servants set the example and take the lead in the house-to-house work, a great blessing will result to the congregation. (Matt. 11:1) If advance appointments are made, perhaps for serving together that very weekend, much good can be progressively accomplished In the field of house-to-house training. If you cannot spend long periods of time, spend what you can, for surely this is acceptable to Jehovah.—Luke 21: 2-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Some of our brothers have morning meetings and have found Sunday afternoon an opportune time to engage in the house-to-house ministry. People are relaxed and often in a good frame of mind and easy to talk to on such occasions. Quite a few of our brothers have found evenings an excellent time to engage in the house-to-house work, and many opportunities have presented themselves for starting home Bible studies, which work helps us to make disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Some publishers have suggested to the circuit and district servants that they are too tired at the end of the week to engage in the house-to-house ministry. It is true we live in a pressure-filled world. We all get tired on occasions, don’t we? But we know how much we can do and so we do what we can. The point is that if we make room for this service in our lives, if we realize that this is a never-to-be-repeated work, surely we will have the right mental attitude toward this avenue of ser</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">♦ The &quot;Men of Goodwill&quot; District Assembly for Pittsburgh has been changed from the Three Rivers Stadium to Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dates remain the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Literature offer for July: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery” </span><span class="font8">book and booklet (not the question booklet, but any booklet for general distribution to the public) on a contribution of 50 cents. August: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font8">book on a contribution of 25 cents. September: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font8"> book on a contribution of 25 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A supply of monthly report cards, magazine distributors’ order blanks and congregation field ministry charts is being sent out to each congregation. However, congregation servants should order regular pioneer supplies for the 1971 service year. Include 12 pink monthly report cards for each regular pioneer; also Weekly Record Sheets for those needing them. There is no need to order supplies for vacation pioneers, but be sure that you have application blanks on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A new circuit assembly program is scheduled to begin in September. We believe you will find it most informative and upbuilding. The public talk </span><span class="font9">vice. In some respects too the field service is an antidote for fatigue. It is therapeutic. It puts us in a good frame of mind so that we actually come away from the field ministry refreshed mentally and often physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> In Bible times our brothers Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Isaiah delivered messages to the nation of Israel. They were the prophets of Jehovah in their time. Some of these prophets like Jeremiah were told in advance that nobody would listen to their message. Jehovah said: &quot;You must speak to them all these words, but they will not listen to you; and you must call to them, but they will not answer you.” (Jer. 7:27) Really, could any people to whom we might preach today from house to house be more unreceptive? Yet, despite the attitude of those Israelites, Jeremiah endured. What a fine example this is for us to endure in a satisfying work that offers unlimited opportunities for Kingdom witnessing in these days 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Today we are living in the “time of the end.” Deserving ones need to be searched out so that they will not perish in the “great tribulation.” (Matt 10:11) These days are the last days for this old system and for a never-to-be-repeated work from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> An experience that occurred recently here in Brooklyn helps us to be aware of the impact that our work from house to house has on people. An elderly gentleman told one of our brothers who was going from house to house: “I admire you people so much, both young and old.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>A great truth was uttered by Christ when he said, “A pupil is not above his teacher, but everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” (Luke 6: 40) Have you thought about how this principle applies to the parent-child relationship? It really brings into focus some thought-provoking possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Your children, who are your pupils, if well instructed, will become like you, the teacher. If you sound down the truth into their minds and hearts, they will be motivated to serve Jehovah just as you are. They will imitate you in looking to the example of Jesus, the Great Teacher, and will want to be his disciples. Jn time they will share in all the features of the service, just as you do. —Eecl. 12:1; Ps. 148:12, 13; 2 Tim. 3:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Why not look at it this way? As a parent you send your children off to school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic, and you expect them to make these involved and complicated subjects their own, don’t you? Think of it. If they can learn such difficult things in their early years, should they not also be able to learn a presentation to use from house to house and then progressively be able to share in the back-call and Bible study work? Is It too much to expect of your children? Not really, although admittedly it requires teach-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Some are planning to vacation pioneer or work in isolated territories or with congregations having large territories not being regularly worked. You might enjoy that too. Perhaps you will choose to tie in your vacation with such plans. Two Bethel couples did this not long ago, working with a small congregation in West Virginia. They had a very fine time. The territory had not been worked for over a year. They were able to talk to just about everyone they met in the territory, placing over 600 pieces of literature in two weeks, and being built up spiritually by the experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> ALso it is good to keep in mind the many opportunities to do incidental witnessing during this season of the year, when traveling to and ing and training on your part if you are a parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Recently a circuit servant wrote the following to the Society : “There are many instances in this circuit where young publishers, under the age of 12, have started and conducted meaningful Bible studies in school even during study periods, with the teacher’s permission. In one congregation a young sister in her early teens started a Bible study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book with a classmate last week. During my visit the classmate was at both the Saturday-night meeting and the public talk on Sunday and then stayed for lunch and went with the young sister in the field service in the afternoon to observe. A young sister of ten conducts two home Bible studies and conducts them well. Possibly the parents could show more confidence in the ability of the young and train them for a balanced ministry rather than only to be magazine publishers. Some of the finest publishers in this circuit are young ones—a pleasure to work with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> How wonderful it Is to see properly trained children, withstanding the pressures of our times and sharing regularly with their parents in the lifesaving service of God ! What delight such families must bring to the Creator’s heart! And, we might add, they are a delight to all of us who observe them in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">from assemblies, on vacations, etc. If we carry some of the publications with us, we may be able to plant seeds of truth that in time will produce fruitage. At the end of July as the reports are compiled we are sure that your efforts will have contributed toward a fine report, and may Jehovah bless you as we all work to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unprecedented Opportunities </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font9">You are the only ones who have the courage to go from house to house with your religious message.” Yes, the house-to-house ministry identifies us as Jehovah’s true servants and gives honest-hearted ones the opportunity to see Christianity in action. Are you personally having a full share in this privilege of service?</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question, ffiox</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">• Why is it beneficial for Kingdom Halls to have a mailbox?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Society receives general inquiries requesting the names and addresses of individuals, these are not supplied. However, the Kingdom Hall address is provided, with the suggestion that the individual write: Presiding Minister, c/o Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It is necessary to treat the names and addresses in our files as confidential, since some organizations and individuals want this information for their mailing lists, and if they obtained it, it would result in the receipt of unwanted correspondence such as literature from apostates and advertisements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not unusual for brothers to write explaining that when they sent a letter to the Kingdom Hall address provided by the Society, it was returned by the postal authorities stamped &quot;no mail receptacle.” And once more they ask how they can get in touch with the congregation servant. Recently a brother who wanted to serve where the need is greater wrote advising that he tried to find the Kingdom Hall but could not. because it had been relocated. As a result he decided to serve elsewhere. Such experiences illustrate the benefits of informing the Society before the Kingdom Hall address is changed and also of equipping the Kingdom Hall with some Kind of mail receptacle, where this is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If your Hall does not have a mailbox at present, you may want to consider the advisability of obtaining one. The decision is one to be made locally. If you are not sure what would be acceptable to the postal authorities, you may check with them to ensure good mail service.</span></p>

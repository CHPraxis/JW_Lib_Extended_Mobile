<p><span class="font13">How amazed we were to learn that 89,239 persons attended the principal meeting at the ten assemblies held in Mexico during the latter part of December. This is more than double the number of publishers there. Additionally, we rejoiced to hear that 2,757 persons were baptized. We have been enjoying the very interesting experiences of the members of the Bethel family who went to Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Brother- Knorr has also announced that the shift of night work at the factory here has now ended. During October, November and December the day and night shifts produced 9,299,186 bound books. Added to September’s report, this means that for the first four months of our new service year, the Brooklyn plant produced 11,531,787 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This extra work has enabled us to fill all the invoices that were made and sent to our shipping department. So the mail that is coming in during January is being cared for within three or four days. Yes, shipments are on their way to the congregations. We are happy to have enough English publications in stock so that we are able to keep our brothers supplied. Supplies of the Bible, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font13"> and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font13"> books, as well as other publications, are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of course, this does not mean that we are caught up with all the foreign shipments or foreign-language printing. We have things scheduled for printing right straight through to the end of April on needed literature and stock that will have to be reprinted to fill our shelves again. But this would be a fine time for any congregation that wants more literature to order it, during these winter months. You might want to get a two- or threemonth supply of publications. This will prepare you for May, when everyone in English-speaking congregations will be using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font13"> book, and in June we will be</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When totaling the reports, what a pleasure it was to find that 288,-431 home Bible studies were being conducted in the United States during December! Much of our field ministry involves preaching the Kingdom message to all sorts of people ‘for the purpose of a witness,’ and we all share in this very necessary work every time we go from house to house. Yet, where there is genuine interest, we have the responsibility to “make disciples . . . teaching them” and preparing them for baptism. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) So, when we preach, it is good to have prominently in mind, not only placing literature, but also starting studies. Do you do that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In 1967, 42.9 percent of the publishers shared in the Bible-study ministry. The year of 1969 saw a fine increase to 46.3 percent. No doubt many more would be very willing to share in this joyful activity. Perhaps that is true of you. If so, how can you get a study started?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Much depends on your spending using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font13">along with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font13"> So you may want to order some literature within the next few months so as to be ready for that work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Another cause for rejoicing was the November reports from many branches. Almost fifty percent of them had new peaks in publishers. It is truly encouraging to see how steadily Jehovah’s work is moving forward! Now we are coming into the second month of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">campaign. We want to care for all those who are turning to Jehovah to gain his favor. May Jehovah bless your efforts to help these persons as we all show ourselves to be good listeners, joyfully enduring. Be assured of our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your brothers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">sufficient time in the house-to-house work, seeking out interested ones. The more time you spend, the more opportunities there are. That is why many who vacation pioneer are able to start new studies during their time of increased activity. Next, make it known at every appropriate opportunity that you are offering not only Bible literature, but also free personal assistance in understanding the Bible. And, finally, be sure to call back on everyone who accepts literature as well as on others who show interest. If, at present, you do these things to some extent, might it be that doing them more fully would lead to a home Bible study? Yes, in most cases it would.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It is not difficult to invite a householder to have a home Bible study, whether you do it on your initial visit or on a back-call. Tell him how much you enjoyed the study that was conducted with you, and that now you would like to share the same delightful truths with him. Of course, he will have questions in his mind. Perhaps the easiest way to answer them is to hand him a copy of the Bible-study folder and read it together. Then, before asking whether he wants a study, why not open the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book to the first chapter (or any other chapter that discusses what particularly interests him) and read and discuss a few paragraphs. Where possible, at least on this first call, use the householder’s Bible when reading the scriptures. Having done this, ask if you may return to continue the discussion. If he agrees and you are able to make a definite appointment, you have the foundation laid for a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> However, if your call is cut short because he is busy, at least leave him the Bible-study folder. Then be sure to call back. When you return, you can refer to the folder </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on -page 3, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">14 min: Presenting the Good New’s. Discuss and demonstrate appropriate points.

(Heb. 11:6; 1 John 5:14; James 4:3) What will help us to avoid having our prayers become, simply a repetition of words? (w64, pp. 557, 558; Ps. 119:145) When prayer is offered in the congregation, how can we show that we fully concur in it? (w64, p. 558; 1 Chron. 16:36; 1 Cor. 14:16) Of •what significance is the portion of the prayer in which one says that one is asking ‘in Jesus’ name’?

<p><span class="font2">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1970 378,040 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN DECEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In spite of cold weather in many parts of the country, the average hours increased to 9.7, to compare with last 'December’s average of 9.4. This shows that creature comforts were not placed ahead of Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The total publisher figure of 363,190 is just slightly below the all-time-high peak of 364,320 for November 1969. This represents a 9-percent increase over the total of 333,354 publishers for December 1968—29,836 more publishers! We are greatly encouraged by this manifold evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts to “make disciples” as commanded by Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do we have reason to expect further evidences of Jehovah’s blessing in the form of publisher increases? Yes, because 745,638 Bibles and books were placed during December. These, along with other literature placements, represent a fine contribution toward the number of symbolic “horses” mentioned at Revelation 9:16-19, and provide a wonderful basis for getting new studies started, don’t they?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When Objections Are Raised</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How should we view objections that people make in our witnessing activity? Persons tell us, for example, “I’m busy,” “I’m not interested,” or “I have my own religion,” etc. Just because an objection is raised, should we conclude that the person is not of a sheeplike disposition? How can we be certain what the householder really means?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When persons say, “I’m busy,” after we have only briefly identified ourselves in our initial remarks, it could be that they truly are busy, or they may really mean that they are not interested. How can we tell? Why not acknowledge the objection, assuming that the person truly is busy and saying something like this : “I’m sorry I caught you at an inopportune time. Perhaps I could call again at a time that would be more convenient for you to discuss the free Bible-study offer that is being made to all persons in your neighborhood. Let me leave this folder in the meantime. May I ask when it would be convenient to come back and get your opinion on the information it contains? ...” If the householder truly is busy, he may agree to having you make a return visit. On the other hand, if what he really meant to say was that he is not interested in the Bible, he will probably tell you that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Quite often people tell us, “I’m not interested.”- We may not have said very much and may wonder if they really understand the purpose of our visit. We could acknowledge the objection, saying: “You may feel 1 hat your present program for Bible reading adequately answers your questions. With so many different religious opinions, do you think they are all approved by God? I&gt;o you feel that the Bible would help a person to answer the question, How do I know whether my religion is approved by God?” Allow the householder to express himself. By doing things in this way, we, for one thing, let the householder know why we are there. There is no need to argue if he clearly understands why we are there and just simply does not want to listen to what we have to say.—2 Tim. 2 : 23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When someone says, “1 have my own religion,” you may find it effective to acknowledge this by saying: “It is good to find someone who still believes in God. Of course, each person must decide for himself what he will do about reading the Bible to see what it has to say on such important matters as: How do I know whether my religion is approved by God? The free Bible-study program that is being offered to you and your neighbors shows where information can be found in your own Bible on such matters. After reading what the Bible has to say, you can determine what you feel is the thing to do.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It does require discernment to determine what the householder means when objections are raised in our witnessing activity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Study for You &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">and proceed just as you would have on the first call if time had permitted.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By the way, have you called back on everyone with whom you placed the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font13"> book and the Bible in December? If not, don’t put it off any longer. They have shown interest; but, as you know from personal experience, very few will make much progress without personal assistance. If the problem is that you cannot find them at home again, why not call them on the phone or write them a letter, or perhaps leave the Bible-study folder in their door with your name and phone number and a note suggesting that they call you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> None of us need feel that we cannot conduct a Bible study because we will not be able to answer all their questions. Jehovah will bless our efforts if we are willing. Really, what is it that most householders need? They need your presence and your conviction that this is the truth. As for answers, they are right there in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book and presented in a very understandable manner. But the problem is that many people will not read it unless someone calls regularly to encourage them. Others may - read the book but do not take time to look up the scriptures, and so do not get the full impact of it. Your simply being there with them, discussing the material, and helping them to see how deeply you appreciate God’s Word is what they need. The results do not depend on your eloquence, or on your knowing all the answers, but on your willingness to ‘plant and water,’ and it is “God who makes it grow.”—1 Cor. 3: 6, 7.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As soon as subscription expiration slips are received by the congregation, they are given to publishers so that calls can be made promptly. Diligence in following through on such matters is important. When the householder cannot be found after repeated calls are made, a sample copy of the magazine can be left with a note saying the subscription has expired, you have tried to get in touch with the individual, etc. A Bible-study folder could be left at the same time, showing your name and phone number, and suggesting that the householder call you. Or, write a letter if you wish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When a person is contacted, you may find it effective' to mention at the outset that you are calling on former subscribers. In this way the householder will know how you got his address. Then give a short presentation incorporating a point from one of the current magazines. After a brief discussion, show where this was taken from in the magazine so the householder will be helped to appreciate its practical value and have a desire to resubscribe. Or, you may want to use the Bible-study folder to explain the free Bible-study offer and then inquire about renewing the subscription thereafter.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Isn’t it enjoyable to discuss a subject of mutual interest with others? Yes, and our being conversational in such matters generally requires that we take an interest in their viewpoint. In our ministry, it requires discernment to determine quickly the interests of a stranger. Then with tact and skill, we can channel the resulting discussion to our Scriptural presentation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Religious news items can be analyzed in the light of the territory we work. Local items are always the best ones to use. Be prepared to develop such news items in various ways to meet effectively the varying attitudes and viewpoints in the territory. Changes in the Catholic church, for example, can be of interest to Catholics as well as nonCatholies, but possibly from different standpoints. A Catholic may be concerned because he is a member of that organization, but a non-Catho-lic’s interest may be only passive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In talking to Catholics, you could say, “Do you agree with the position being taken by so many of the priests nowadays that the Bible is not the Word of God but that parts of it are only myth? [g 4/22/68, pp. 13, 14] Do you think that such a trend away from God’s Word will continue? If so, does this make the Bible untrue?” In the developing discussion, direct attention to scriptures such as Romans 3:3, 4 and Hebrews 6:17, 18. Explain that Jehovah’s witnesses are encouraging people to do more Bible reading and study. Proceed to explain the free study arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In talking to non-Catholics, you could say: “No doubt you are aware of the trend among religious leaders toward publicly discrediting the Bible. We often hear of priests and ministers who say from the pulpit that they don’t even believe in God. [g 4/22/69, pp. 15, 16] In the place of the Bible they offer godless evolution and worldly philosophy. Do you feel that such a course helps or hinders the cause of godless communism?” Get the householder to express himself, and adapt your presentation accordingly. In the course of your discussion, have in mind the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">objective toward which you are working. Consider transitions from their response to the points you feel should be made. Or, consider how the point of discussion you have brought up will tie in with the literature offer or the free Biblestudy offer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> In discussing news items dealing with the breakdown in law and order, after brief introductory remarks, you can say: “No doubt you are aware of the trend toward lawlessness and anarchy. Do you think a time will ever come when you can leave your home unlocked and go out on the street at night and not be in fear? [Let householder express self.] Do you think that this is the way God purposed for man to live? Did you know that the Bible foretells that just such conditions as we §ee today would come before God established his righteous new system for the benefit of all obedient mankind?” Attention can then be directed to appropriate material in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> or to chapter 10 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By being aware of current developments and incorporating appropriate items into our presentation, we will have a fine opportunity to get the householder to make some expression and to establish points that will be helpful to him. We will be able to give tailor-made presentations that really fit the individual needs of the person we are witnessing to and, in this way, we can more fully accomplish our ministry.—2 Tim. 4: 5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">o A pioneer in Pennsylvania started a Bible study with a neighbor.

<p><span class="font11">• How should we go about terminating unfruitful Bible studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is a question that we ought to consider if any of our present studies have been in progress for approximately six months. Are they coming to the congregation meetings as yet, and are they beginning to make their lives over in harmony with what they have learned from God’s Word? If so, w<sup>T</sup>e want to continue to help them. But, if not, it may be that we could accomplish more good with our time by using it to -witness to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you realize that you should terminate a particular study, discuss it with the householder in a kindly way. Let him know that you have counted it a privilege to share with him what the Bible says, but remind him that it is a six-month free study course that w<sup>y</sup>e offer. Now it is up to him to decide what he will do about what he has learned and to take the initiative to follow through.—Josh. 24:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Emphasize the urgency of the times and explain that we want to give others the same opportunity to learn the truth and take their stand on Jehovah’s side.—Zeph. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Explain to the householder that you will be available and that if he wants to get in touch with you you will be glad to help him spiritually. Encourage him to think seriously about the course he should take in order to please Jehovah and to pray about it. Urge him to come to the meetings, and let him know that if he really decides to serve Jehovah and regularly associates with the congregation, you will be glad to resume the study, using more advanced material to help him progress to maturity.</span></p>

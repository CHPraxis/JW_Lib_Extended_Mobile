<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Go therefore and make disciples . . . baptizing them.”—Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. XIII NO. 12</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QW ^Kingdom ^PubMe/tS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">Well, you did it again! The loving service of all you brothers has resulted in another new peak of publishers. It is the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">sixth</span><span class="font14"> peak for this calendar’ year and the first in the two months of this service year. Isn’t it fine that 394,920 publishers shared in the ministry during October? That is (5,000 more than ever before! And 5,481 have been baptized here in the United States in the first two months of this service year. You are truly living up to our yeartext: “Make disciples.. . . baptizing them”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is truly amazing to see how much of an increase we have had here in the United States in just the past two years. The fine October report represents an increase of 71,232 over the average number of publishers for 1968, and that is more than enough people to fill the normal seating area in Yankee Stadium. Just think of it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Surely this fine increase reflects much hard work. In the past, you have sown much seed, and on many occasions you may have felt that your efforts were not meeting with much response. Yet your faithfulness has had an effect on the minds of observers, and now we rejoice in a marvelous ingathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">You are to be commended too for the splendid work you did with the magazines during October. You placed 9,087,895 copies of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> Your orders made it necessary for us here in Brooklyn to print 5,030,000 copies of just the special issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Aivake! </span><span class="font14">and 4,884,000 copies of the special </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> That is enough magazines so that one out of every five families in the entire country could each have had one. The subscription report too is excellent. It shows more than 5,000 ahead of last year —a total of 272,605. You have done a wonderful job, brothers, and it makes our heart rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What will December bring? Well, our service theme is “Teaching All</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">feidhmg All Nation jes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup>When Jesus said, “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them,” he had in mind more than the eleven to whom he spoke. It would not have been possible for that small group of eleven to teach all nationalities and baptize them, but they began that work. Today Jehovah has seen fit to gather out of this world more than 1,483,000 of us Kingdom proclaimed so this work could be accomplished, and more are coming.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Through his organization Jehovah has provided equipment for doing the work, including the Bible in a number of languages as well as publications such as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font14"> book in dozens of languages. So in the month of December we are busy offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font14"> to all persons whom we can contact. This is an excellent offer because the people do need to have a Bible in their home, and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">.Truth </span><span class="font14">book will be the basis for our teaching effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In this country there are people of different nationalities. Sometimes industrial areas have settlements of immigrants. In other parts of the land there are agricultural workers, doctors, technicians, and professional workers who have come from many different nations. Some men who have been in the armed forces have married wives from other nations. Do you know where there may be some persons in your territory who speak another language? The Society has printed a booklet called “Preach the Word” containing a presentation in many lan-Nationalities with a View to Baptism.” So we plan to be busy, and surely Jehovah will bless our efforts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Be assured of our warm Christian love for all of you and our prayers on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Your brothers, </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font14">guages, and you can show the appropriate page to a person who knows the language so as to give the witness. Orders can be taken for </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font14">books or others. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List,</span><span class="font14"> which the literature servant has, shows what publications are available in different languages. Furthermore, on the second page of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> there is a list of the languages in which the magazines appear. Very frequently it is possible to get subscriptions from individuals by showing the English magazine and explaining that it is available in their language. How long has it been since your congregation gave special consideration to the nonEnglish-speaking people? How many foreign-language publications are on the shelves in your Kingdom Hall stock? Offer them to those who use the languages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In many experiences reported to the office brothers have told about conducting studies with interested people by using their English copy of the book and having somebody else use a book in his language. Others have been able to turn names and addresses over to brothers who know the language of the interested person, and in this way a study can be started. The objective of our work is teaching all nationalities with a view to baptism, and this is done by the home Bible study work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> But whether you have in your territory any who speak a foreign language or not, there is in your territory someone of at least one nation, your own, so make it your goal in December to visit people and present the good news. There is an opportunity to reach a new national peak of publishers in December. Jehovah has been blessing the work very much, and if all of us will have a share in the Kingdom work in one way or another during December, a tremendous witness will be given as we try to teach all nationalities with a view to baptism.</span></p></li></ul>

Whether people receive the Kingdom message graciously or not, we bring praise to Jehovah by calling at their homes and telling them why we are there. Strive to be a qualified teacher.

<p><span class="font13">15 min: Suggested Presentation for “Watchtower” Campaign. Discussion followed by demonstration. “Watchtower” issues for January through April will include articles emphasizing the theme “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.” Many fine talking points will be found in these articles. The purpose of the following sermon is to draw attention to the fact that only God’s kingdom will be able to solve man’s problems. People need to see the difference between God’s kingdom and what it will do and earthly governments, which most sincere people realize are not able to accomplish their full aims. More persons today than ever before have definite ideas about what a government should do, so it would be good to let them express themselves. At the outset, reason with the householder. Try to involve him in a conversation. A few timely, well-thought-out questions will help to arouse the householder’s thinking and interest. See if he will mention a problem that is his concern. What does he think is the solution to the problem? Does he believe new laws are the answer? Does he think new officials would be able to make people love one another and love what is right? Listen to his opinion, but instead of trying to draw<sup>r </sup>an immediate solution to the problem in question, explain that human leaders and officials have been trying in vain to solve this as well as most of mankind’s woes. However, there is one government that will succeed. Then draw his attention to the Bible’s explanation of what this government will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme; The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Hello. My name is ---. Today the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">people are confronted with many problems in life—illness, pollution, trouble in the schools, insecurity, wars and violence are some of them. What do you think can be done to solve these problems? Do you think that new laws are the answer? What do you</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">feel is the greatest problem? [Allow the householder time to give his opinion and acknowledge that many governmental leaders work hard to find solutions, but with little lasting success.] Do you realize that there is one government that has the answer and will not fail in carrying out the solution? It will not be government by men. The Scriptures identify this government, calling it God’s kingdom. Matthew 6:9, 10 indicates coming of God’s kingdom will cause God’s will to be done here on earth. [Not necessary to read this text.] [Here use one of the following texts that best fits the problem under consideration. The first could be applied to illness or pollution. The second, to oppression or injustice. The third, to lawlessness or violence, etc.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rev. 21:3, 4—God’s kingdom to do away with sorrow, sickness and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dan. 2:44—God’s kingdom to crush all kingdoms that have oppressed mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ps. 37:10, 11—God’s kingdom to destroy the wicked one and provide abundance of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“So God’s kingdom will provide a lasting solution to mankind’s problems, large and small. We all want to know when this heavenly government will do this for the earth, as our lives are involved!” Refer to article in current “Watchtower” and present offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">12 min: Concluding comments, with remarks about month’s theme. (“Watchtower,” January 1, 1971) Song 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(Arrange program locally.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Encouragement</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> We are all indebted to Jehovah for the great encouragement he continues to give us as we serve him. Now the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> is coming out and we will read in its pages a record of the tremendous blessing Jehovah gave to his people throughout, the world in the past service year. During December you may find it possible to read quite a few pages of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> because of the holiday season or, perhaps, if there is severe weather. Take advantage of your moments at home to begin reading your </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font14"> Make note of the experiences that you find especially fitting for your situation or to encourage someone in yqur congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Maybe there are appropriate experiences that can be used to buoy up and encourage the interested ones, showing how others have had success in coming into harmony with Jehovah despite obstacles. Worldliness has been overcome, demonism has been defeated, marriage problems have been solved—yes, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook (Continued on page</span><span class="font14"> 8, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Know Them by Name?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God knows all the stars in the heavens by name. (Ps. 147: 4) Christ Jesus knows all of his followers by name. (John 10:3, 14) Do you know all of your brothers in the congregation by name, or do you know them only by sight? When we are conducting a congregational meeting, do we address the brothers by their names or only by the term “brother” or “sister”? When introducing newly interested persons to others at the meetings, are there some of the brothers we pass by because of not knowing their names? How many in the congregation do we greet by just saying “Hello, brother” or “Hello, sister”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Here are a few suggestions for improving your ability to remember the names of your brothers .and sisters as well as undedicated persons. Each week try to arrange to be at the Kingdom Hall for sufficient time before and after the meetings to associate with others. Then make it a practice to learn the name of a person or two that you know only by sight and not by name, possibly writing it down on a slip of paper. Seeing the name helps to impress it on the mind. Introduce yourself to him, or perhaps ask another brother his name to refresh your memory,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Encouragement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">is a very fine encouragement to follow right principles and gain victories. It is being printed in English, French, German and Spanish.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Now is the time to make plans for your family to consider the experiences from each country in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font14"> Some will have the reading each day in connection with the daily text and comments. Others may choose another time for this special event. The best way is to make a plan and stick to it so nothing is missed from this source of Christian encouragement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Change in Price</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Due to increased mail costs it is necessary for the Society to increase rates for the following: Handbills, 50c per 1,000; Memorial invitations and tracts, $1.00 per 1,000. These new rates will apply beginning January 1, 1971.</span></p>

Associate the name with the individual and learn something about the brother during your conversation with him, such as, where he lives, what congregation book study he attends, etc. Listen to his field experiences and share yours with him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> With a national average of 107 percent attending our </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study during the year, there are many newly interested ones at the Kingdom Halls each week. Having this in mind, let us all make a special effort to learn their names and to try to help them. With the newer one, one good method to learn his name is to walk up to him and say: “My name is ---. What’s yours?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Then, knowing his name, you can continue in an enjoyable conversation that will make him feel welcome at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Though we will never equal Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, who never unintentionally forget names,' we can know all in our congregation by name. This will do much to promote the family-like spirit in the congregation.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> More bound books and Bibles than ever before were distributed in the United States this past service year—6,960,376! This figure represents 78,827 more book placements during the past service year than the previous one. But our placing Bible study aids is a means to an end and not the end itself. So what has happened as a result of these placements is of concern to all of us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Something good happened, for the United States annual report showed an average increase of 27,-888 publishers in the field. Paradoxically the report also showed that 7,952 fewer Bible studies were conducted, the total being 295,468 on an average per month. More workers, more placements, but fewer studies—why? Is more effective follow-up work needed? Let us assume that many of these studies were started and conducted in harmony with the Society’s recommendation of a six-month program; then for the most part these are new studies or they have been conducted for a few months only. This could mean that for every 24 books placed, only one resulted in a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> However, what about the other 23 of every 24 books placed that are in the homes of people in our territory? Are these good books simply on shelves along with the best of books, the Bible? Many times when you are working from door to door and have begun to explain to the householder that you have a fine Bible study aid for him he informs you, “I already have one of those.” This makes you happy and you tell him how pleased you are, but then what? Do you try to place a different book with him? Or do you say you hope he reads the one he already </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Overseers: To enable the Society to complete the monthly report, we would appreciate your sending the congregation report to the Society no later than the fifth of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ After December 21 congregations may begin ordering the 1970 bound volumes of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> They are available in English, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. Due to the limited demand for Hungarian bound volumes of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> the Society will discontinue producing them beginning with the 1971 volumes. The 1970 Hungarian volume of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> will be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ The cost for the American Standard Version Bible, pocket edition with a blue leatherette cover (bi22), has returned to its original rate. It is now $1.40 for publishers and $.75 for pioneers. The public rate will be $1.50. ♦ The Society has produced a limited supply of the deluxe songbook.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Quick Presentations</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In this country many people are very busy during the holiday season, but we will not hold back from optimistically presenting the offer. Each publisher can decide what would be the best method of presenting the offer where busy people are encountered. The June 1970 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom. Ministry</span><span class="font14"> has a number of suggestions and here are more. One might say:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. I represent an international Bible society which this month has its representatives in more than 200 lands encouraging everyone to consider the Bible. This </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font14"> of the entire Bible, in modern, easily understood language, is being distributed with this book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font14"> to help in understanding the Bible. I would like to leave these with you today. A contribution of $1.25 will make it possible to print more for someone else. Already thirteen million copies of this Bible have been distributed throughout the world in several languages giving comfort to people everywhere.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If you meet someone who declines the offer, saying he has a Bible in his home, you might say: “That is good. During our house-to-house visits many people have told us they have a Bible but have had some difficulty in understanding much of it. They have found this small book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font14"> a fine aid to them in using the Bible. If you read this book and then go back to reading your Bible again, you will have a foundation for readily understanding the reason why God gave us His Word of truth. We leave the book for a contribution of 25c.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In some cases you may find it advantageous to lead with the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font14">book. During November we became accustomed to presenting the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font14">book and the points that you have used can be employed in a brief presentation. Then say: “We place this book along with a modernlanguage Bible for a small contribution of $1.25. I would like to leave these with you and I am sure that after the holidays, during the winter, you will have good opportunities to read and enjoy them.”</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font14">If this is not accepted, you can quickly drop to the offer of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font14"> book for 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If you observe that people are extremely busy and it is not convenient for them to talk, you might simply produce the Bible and the book and say: “I brought these for you and hoped there would be time to explain. Perhaps I can leave them with you now on a contribution of $1.25, and at another time, when you are not so.busy, I can explain more about them to you.” That is all one would have to say. Such a presentation may result in placement of quite a number of publications. It is essential to make the offer, otherwise it will not be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Wherever anything is placed with busy people be sure to make proper notation so you will be able to return at a convenient time to help those who are receiving the truth, and thus share in ‘teaching all nationalities.’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">“I Already Have One of Those” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">{ConVd) </span><span class="font14">has? Do you tell him that the one who left the book with him is going to be back and that, when the return visit is made, it would be good if they could discuss the Bible together and have a Bible study from this publication? Is this really enough? Will this type of encouragement result in starting a Bible study? Most likely not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Therefore, why not apply the Bible principle of planting and watering, and let God make it grow. (1 Cor. 3:6-9) The planting has been done, but the seed is dormant. No one is making the back-call. Take advantage of your opportunity, like Apollos, to water. Our purpose at the door does not change when the householder already has a book. It would be best to proceed with the goal of starting a Bible study on the first call. The first meeting outlined in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> of April 1970 featured a very practical and workable way of starting studies in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font14"> book. Why not try it at a door when a person says, “I already have one of those.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> The prospects are wonderful ’ A good percentage of the 23 of every 24 books placed with persons in our territory are in the hands ‘of people who are sighing and groaning over</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">• Are all dedicated males in the congregation qualified to give public talks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Qualifications for public speakers are mentioned on pages 150 to 152 of the “Lamp” book. Not all dedicated men have these qualifications, but many can develop them over a period of time by regular participation in the Theocratic Ministry School. Additionally, age is a factor. One who teaches in this way in the congregation ought not to be a person newly dedicated, but one experienced in handling the Word. Therefore 18 years is recommended as a reasonable minimum age for public speakers; however, an exception might be considered when a young brother is an appointed servant in a congregation where there are insufficient older brothers available tb give talks, if the congregation committee finds that he meets the qualifications set forth in the “Lamp” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If at one time a person had been disfellowshiped or disassociated, may he ever give a public talk? This might occur, but only after at least ten years from reinstatement. (For details see “The Watchtower,” 8/15/65, p. 497; “Lamp,” p. 121.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">what they see. They have shown that they care about God, for they took the book. So when someone says to us, “I already have one of those,” let’s help him to see what God has purposed for the future, by starting a Bible study with him, and thus make his sigh be one of relief and his tears be those of joy. —Ezek. 9 : 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">What a wonderful time we had on March 8. It was the day of the graduation of Gilead’s 48th class. Tiie Assembly Hall was packed and the program was superb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Knorr pointed out that the students in the class, from twenty-one lands around the earth, were going to serve in twenty-four lands where the preaching fields are ripe for harvesting as recent reports show. For example, he announced that four students were going to Chile, a land where a 15-percent increase in publishers recently brought the total to 6,824, and they placed an all-time peak of 18,764 books. Five students are headed for Ecuador, where book placements in January were double the report of the same month last year and a new peak of 2,623 publishers shared in .■ the work. Huw splendid!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ti Just think what a fine assign-' ment the four students have who anticipate serving in Japan! That land reported its thirtieth consecutive new peak, with 8,316 publishers I Consider, too, the joy of the four headed for Korea. It was reported that when freezing weather there forced the closing of schools, many young folks zealously entered the vacation pioneer ranks and a new peak of 1,288 vacation pioneers was reached. Not only that, but Korea had its twenty-sixth publisher peak in 27 months; 11,380 reported preaching, a 21-percent increase! Yes, the harvest is ripe and the increase is on as never before! In his talk, &quot;The Way,&quot; Brother Knorr urged the graduating missionaries to stick to their assignments. Forthcoming issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> will contain more details of the fine program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Soon we shall lie seeing students coming in for the next class of Gilead, due to begin on April 27. It is planned that 72 students from six different lands will then be with us. We anxiously look forward to meeting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The willingness of these young men and women to offer themselves</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Writing a Letter?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What kind of letter? Paul answers in his inspired message to the Corinthian congregation : “You yourselves are our letter, . . . For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers, inscribed not with ink but with spirit of a living God, not on stone tablets, but on fleshly tablets, on hearts.” Yes, the disciples we make, with Jehovah’s help, are living letters recommending us as fruitful Christian ministers.—2 Cor, 3:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Success in writing a ‘living letter’ depends first of all on our faithfulness in our ministry; in other words, on our having a regular, full share in the ministry. April is a month when we give special attention to helping all share in the ministry, whether they be those who have been publishing for some time or new ones now ready to begin. What a fine goal it would be for all publishers to take part in the ministry the first week of April, and then to report that service. Family heads can take the lead in this by lovingly helping all in the family to share in the ministry and report that share early in April. Those who are vacation pioneere can make themselves available to assist newer publishers. This will certainly be a loving thing to do.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> April brings our 32nd annual </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription campaign to a climax, so we will do all we can this last month of the campaign to make it a grand climax! Have we personally explored every avenue that leads to new subscriptions? There are at least seven such avenues we can utilize in addition to for service wherever they can best be used stirs us all to join with them in seeking success through faithfulness in the ministry. And during April, with its special activity, there is much for all of us to do in that joyful ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">the regular offer of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">subscription from door to door. They are: (1) Offering both subscriptions. (2) Following up all promises. (3) Calling back on all whose subscriptions have expired. (4) Sending gift subscriptions to friends, relatives and acquaintances. (5) Writing up subscriptions when receiving extra contributions in magazine service. (6) Offering subscriptions on all back-calls, including magazine-route calls. (7) Making subscription offer to all with whom we conduct Bible studies. Our appreciation for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> will move us to explore each one of these possibilities to the full to obtain more subscriptions. A subscription for this journal is really a semimonthly course in Bible study and we can present it as such. It is a real teacher of Bible truth that demands attention both by its well-written articles and by the fact that it appears twice each month in the home and so cannot be set aside as easily as a single piece of literature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We come now to the point of actually writing our “letter.” This we do in large measure through a Bible study with the interested one we have found. How can we offer a Bible study to a subscriber for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine? A proved approach is suggested under “Your Service Meetings” on page 2, for the week of April 5. A number of brothers have tried this approach and found it simple, successful, and one that did not leave the householder with the feeling of receiving too much literature. You may want to try it with the goal in mind of establishing a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In April, then, by our early and full share in the ministry, our diligent efforts to bring </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> into the homes of many more, and our faithfully working to establish Bible studies with sheeplike persons, we will be taking real steps toward successfully writing our own letter, “not with ink but with spirit on fleshly tablets, on hearts.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">13 min: Suggested back-call, referred to in main article, “Are You Writing a Letter?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Chairman gives talk based on first paragraph of main article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Publisher makes back-call on new subscriber. After the initial greeting, say: “You know, the attitude you expressed in our conversation last week impressed me. I really appreciated the interest and respect you had for the Bible thoughts we discussed. That’s why I thought you'd enjoy something in this ‘Truth’ book.” Hand him a book and have him turn to page 5. Ask him to read the first sentence. After he has, ask him, “Would you like to?” Repeat this with the next two questions, giving him opportunity each time to express himself. Now have him read the final sentence in paragraph one. Without getting answer, you could say, “For an answer to that question, notice question ‘a’ on the next paragraph.” Read it and let him find the answer. (Then proceed to consider with him the next few paragraphs, to show him what hope the Bible gives. This the chairman could describe rather than demonstrate.) After making arrangements for your next call you might say. “If you would like to have that book for use at our next visit, we leave it for 25 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman: This very simple and straightforward approach could be used with success when calling back on subscribers, or where magazines or books have been placed, or where no literature was taken but interest was shown.

<p><span class="font10">20 min: Presenting the “Mystery” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman displays “Mystery” book. Comments about May campaign. In territories where people are somewhat familiar with Bible a publisher might do this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Demonstrate: “Have you ever read the Bible book of Revelation? Many people have read it and wondered about the meaning of its numerous symbolic expressions. This book ‘Then Is Finished the Mystery of God’ contains an interesting verse-by-verse consideration of much of this last book of the Bible and shows how other parts of the Bible help us to understand the book of Revelation. History and current events also play a part.” Open book and show how headings give verses under consideration on each page. Publisher could then say: “Chapter 24 is a very interesting one. This chapter tells what the book of Revelation says about God's promises for the near future when a new system of things wilRbe in operation here on the earth.” (Turn to page 368. Read the last paragraph on page 368 over onto page 369.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1 min.) Chairman explains that many other presentations can be used. Simplicity is important. Another presentation that might be used effectively in some territories includes opening the Bible to Revelation 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Demonstrate presentation: “Have you ever read the Bible book of Revelation? Note what Revelation 1:3 says.” Then after reading the scripture, the publisher might say: “God’s promise made here is that happiness comes to those who read thr words of this prophecy and observe th things written in it. When and ho does this occur? Now is God’s ap pointed time. The book of Revelation is a prophecy having its fulfillment in this century and it is very interesting to see how history and current events dovetail with prophecy written nearly 2,000 years ago. Therefore, all men on earth should desire to learn what is in the Bible and get in line for God’s blessings.” Then the publisher might turn to Chapter 24 and conclude as did the presentation outlined above. After placing book, publisher makes note on House-to-House Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(7 min.) Chairman tells how publishers can plan to call back as soon as possible. Publisher can return with his own question booklet and explain how the book can be studied. In some cases it may be a good idea to invite the interested person to the regular congregation book study where the book is being studied. A question booklet can be placed with such persons to encourage them to prepare ahead of time. On the back-call publisher can talk to interested person and see what his interests are and decide whether to try to start the study using the “Mystery” book or the booklet that was placed or to bring out the “Truth” book and talk about some points in it. Give examples. It is important not to wait too long before calling back. Suggest one week should be the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">17 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate Theocratic News items and announcements. Discuss &quot;Using the ‘Yearbook.’ ” Song 93.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING MAY 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each congregation will plan its own program for this meeting.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">) How Are Your Congregational Manners?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A person with good manners is a pleasure to be with; in fact, our good manners contribute considerably to the happiness of those with whom we associate. The Scriptural principle underlying good manners was stated by Jesus when he said: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.”—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But what do we mean when we speak of congregational manners’ We mean the manners we have and show’ toward our brothers when congregated together. For example, always being on time for the meetings demonstrates good manners. When we are late we can be quite a distraction to our brothers who are listening to the program and to the brother speaking introductory words for our benefit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If we have the privilege of taking part in a demonstration or giving a talk, there are a number of things we can do to show consideration for our brothers. If microphone equipment is used in our Kingdom Hall, we can be careful always to speak directly into the microphone so that all can hear us clearly and easily. In a demonstration we should be careful always to face our brothers in the audience as much as possible so that they can see plainly what we are demonstrating and benefit from our facial expression and gestures. When we know that we will be having some part on the program, it is a considerate thing to arrive early and usually it is good to take a seat near the aisle toward the front of the Kingdom Hall. This conserves time and avoids the distraction we cause our brothers when we have to walk past them out of the row where we are seated and then to the front of the hall. This is also very helpful to our Ministry School servant, for he will know we are present, we can give him our counsel sheet ahead of time, and he can begin his counsel to us without lengthy hesitation while we are returning to our seat. And being careful to keep our assigned part on the meeting within its allotted time shows kindness to the brothers who have worked hard on the meeting parts that will follow ours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We who are servants can, in a further way, show ourselves to have good congregational manners. That is by being in our seats, listening attentively, at each meeting. As servants we have a number of duties that are best handled at the Kingdom Hall, but it is better that we cbme a little earlier or remain a little longer at the hall to care for these responsibilities than to take time during the meeting to handle them. If we make this our habit, we will never distract our brothers during a meeting, we will be taking good care of our personal spiritual needs, and we will in this way be a fine example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Every effort is made each week to conclude the meetings on time. At the end of each meeting everybody has an opportunity to express himself in song and to join in prayer to Jehovah. All of us do well to stay at our seats during this important period of praise and share in worship of Jehovah together.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the “Yearbook”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are you currently conducting a home Bible study? If so, have you supplied the householder with a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1970 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> and calendar? It would be a fine thing to do. By reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> any newly interested one will be aided to appreciate the international scope of the preaching work. As he learns how others have overcome obstacles to attend meetings and to share in serving Jehovah, he will be encouraged to do the same. And the calendar will help to keep before him the goal of becoming a baptized disciple of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society still has on hand a good supply of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1970 Yearbook </span><span class="font11">and calendar, and we would like to have them put to use as early in the year as possible. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> is now available for 25 cents each, and the calendar for 10 cents. Order as many copies as you can use, and we will be glad to send them just as long as the supply lasts. We encourage you to do it soon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">HOW DID WE DO IN FEBRUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were 170,929 new subscriptions obtained in February, compared with 155,048 last February. This makes a total of 362,171 for the first two months of the current &quot;Watchtower” campaign. This is 61,232 more than last January and February—-an increase of 20 percent! It is evident there is much interest yet to be cared for in the little time remaining, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The total publisher figure of 365,886 represents a 7.2-percent increase over last February, only 158 publishers short of the all-time high peak in January of this year. And we have another new peak in pioneers, going over 15,000 for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May I Deliver Them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When offering subscriptions for 7’ftc </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> from house to house, we have often been told, “I can’t take them today.” The next time this happens, you might offer to deliver the magazines. In, some cases, persons may not be interested in subscribing at the moment, but would be glad to have you deliver the magazines, much the same as newspapers are delivered. Some /have personal objections to having our magazines come through the mail to their home, or to having their names on a mailing list, but are glad to take the magazines when someone calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are advantages to having a magazine route, too. For one thing, by your calling regularly you get acquainted with the people. You have opportunity to sow seeds of truth by leaving the magazines for them to read and by your personal comments each time you call. It may be that later they will desire to subscribe for the magazines. It may be, also, that as interest is kindled, the individual or family being called on will be agreeable to a weekly home Bible study. Remember, each time you deliver the magazines, a back-call can be counted.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Society is NOT arranging for </span><span class="font10">any charter flights, so brothers who desire to attend conventions in these places will have to make their own personal travel arrangements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do You Think I Can Do It?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Perhaps you are one that has been attending the service meetings and listening to different ones speaking about having a part in field service. Have you been wondering whether you could take part in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and wanting to ask someone, “Do you think I can do it?” You will be glad to know that the answer is, “Yes; everyone who is associated with the congregation and meets the qualifications can speak to others about the Kingdom message.” Through Jehovah’s visible organization the Kingdom message is made available in printed form. You have become familiar with these publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Everyone can place magazines. Copies of them are available from</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Men of Good Will” District Assemblies V __________________________________________________________</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">You are no doubt eagerly looking forward to making early arrangements for vacations in order to attend the “Men of Good Will” District Assemblies this summer. Without question you will want to be present at one of the thirty-two assemblies that have been arranged in the United States as listed below : June 25-28: Eugene, Ore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">July 9-12: Bloomington, Minn.; Boston, Mass.; Charlotte, N.C.; Hallandale, Fla. (Spanish also); Hampton, Va.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Jersey City, N.J.; Macon, Ga.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; San Bernardino, Calif. (Spanish only).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">July 16-19: Anaheim, Calif.; Bismarck, N. Dak.; Detroit, Mich. (Spanish also) ; Jersey City, N.J.; Laurel, Md.; Monroe, La.; Oakland, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">July 23-26: Amarillo, Tex. (Spanish also); Butte, Mont.; El Paso, Tex.; Jersey City, N.J. (Spanish only).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">July 30-August 2: Alexandria, La.; Fort Worth, Tex.; Fresno, Calif.; St. Louis, Mo.; Salt Lake City, Utah ; San Antonio, Tex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">August 6-9: Corpus Christi, Tex. (Spanish only).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">August 13-16: Wilmington, Del.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Generally, brothers attend the nearest assembly. However, there are a few areas where we would the magazine-territory servant. Why not go to the place where the magazine supplies are kept and get at least ten copies? You may wish to obtain five of each kind. Then you can offer the two different magazines together when you speak to people. Perhaps at first you would like to go with someone else to see how the magazines are offered. The presentations are very brief, with reference being made to only one or two particular articles or points. Your overseer or any servant will be pleased to help you arrange to go with someone if it is not convenient to make those arrangements yourself. April is a fine opportunity for all of those who love Jehovah to share in the ministry. Because you are associated with the congregation, we say, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Yes, you can do it!&quot; </span><span class="font11">like to suggest a preference in order to balance the size of the crowd to suit the facilities that we were able to rent. We suggest that, to the extent possible, the publishers in the New York metropolitan area attend assemblies according to this arrangement : Jersey City assembly for July 9-12: New York circuits #1, #2, #10, #11, #15, #17, #21 and Pennsylvania #2. Jersey City assembly for July 16-19: New York circuits #18, #19, #20 and New Jersey circuits #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7. (Notice that English assemblies will be held in Jersey City on two separate weekends, and the Spanish on a third weekend.) Boston: New York circuits #3, #5, #7, #12 and Connecticut #1. It is recommended that brothers in the Chicago metropolitan area attend the St. Louis assembly ; St. Louis could benefit from the large crowd to give a witness there. We would like to ask metropolitan Denver publishers to attend the assembly in Salt Lake City. Since the facilities at Hallandale are considerably larger than those at Jacksonville, it will be helpful if Florida Circuits #2 and #7 will attend the Hallandale convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If these arrangements are followed, there should be ample seats for all who attend. This information supercedes what appeared in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of March 1, 1970.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">For which talks in the Theocratic Ministry School is the student to prepare a theme?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the printed schedule “Theocratic Ministry School for 1970“ suitable themes are provided for talk No. 2 and talk No. 5 each week. For instance, on the week of April 12 talk No. 2 has the theme “Jesus’ early life and baptism show God’s direction.” That same week talk No. 5 is on the theme “Are the Christian Bible writers reliable?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, the students assigned to give talks Nos. 1, 3 and 4, from &quot;Aic/ to Bible Understanding,” usually select their own appropriate themes. Often the identification of these three talk: in the printed schedule is merely a broad subject. For instance, a talk might be on the subject “Bethlehem,” but the word “Bethlehem” is hardly a descriptive theme. It does not aid the audience to determine and remember the specific point or aspect you intend to cover. Depending on the material to be developed, a talk on that subject might have the theme “A blessing for us came out of Bethlehem,” or “God foretold prominence for little Bethlehem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With some talks the printed schedule, in identifying the material, does narrow the subject somewhat (“Diseases and Treatment—Accuracy of Scriptural Concepts, Quarantine&quot;). In most cases it still would be best to analyze the material under the assigned subheadings and form a theme that gives the central idea </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font10"> will present. With the subheadings “Accuracy of Scriptural Concepts” and “Quarantine” the theme might be a statement such as “The Bible’s information about diseases and treatment is accurate” or a question such as “Is the Bible a book of folklore?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A theme helps to give direction to a talk. It should express the gist of the talk, making the points memorable. There is an abundance of material for each talk from “Aid,” so, after noting the speech quality you are working on, you should: (1) Analyze the material. (2) Choose a theme that fits the points you want to present. (3) Develop your outline.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Therefore everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rockmass.” (Matt. 7:24) Did you notice what makes a man truly discreet? It is not simply </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hearing,</span><span class="font10"> but includes</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">doing.</span><span class="font10"> Yes, building things on a right foundation means being active, accomplishing something. We ourselves have been built on the right foundation and now we are anxious to help build others on that same foundation. (1 Cor. 3:10, 11) What</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Uly deaft ^3-e^ou/ ^PubCislie/ts QVo/tM QAM:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The December reports came in from 200 countries, and I thought you would like to know what’s happening. Well, December showed a new peak in publishers of 1,345,111. This increase of 88,327 publishers over last year’s average makes all of us very happy! Here was something else that was most revealing: In the first four months of this 1970 service year, 55,754 persons symbolized their dedication by immersion. If this is any criterion of what we might expect during the next eight months, then upward of 150,000 persons will be baptized by the end of August. Can that be true? Yes, if it be Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No doubt about it, Jehovah is blessing our efforts in tills marvelous ingathering work. If this projection of maybe 150,000 newly baptized Wit’ passes proves to l&gt;e true, then, including those baptized in 19(&gt;9, the two .. ears' total will be more than one-quarter of a million Christian witnesses. Do you feel the responsibility of seeing to it that these newly dedicated ones are feeding on the Word of God regularly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What, are you doing about it personally? Well, in harmony with the theme for March we certainly want to help to build everyone on Christ Jesus as the foundation and to appreciate what Jehovah God. is doing for us through him. The Memorial celebration will implant deeper in our minds this truth, and by loving personal attention we will surely want to help these new ones in this regard, too, won’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These are perilous times! Individually each one of us must stay inside the congregation of God. We must study the Word of God together. This is truly essential to our staying on &quot;The Road Back to Peace in Paradise.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During April we always try to put forth an extra effort to help newly interested ones to appreciate the privilege of field service. Very likely you will bring many persons to the congregation’s Memorial celebration, and likely you can aid some of them to join in praising God during April. If they are going to get Jehovah’s goodwill they will have to get busy in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, like you are doing. It is urgent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The activities of March and April will no doubt start many interested ones thinking about attending one of the fine conventions this summer. We certainly will want to help them to get to a convention. Many of them undoubtedly are going to be baptized at that time. What a privilege you have to help these people to prepare for that. And what happiness we all are having in these “last days” helping so many people to get onto Jehovah’s side. Without hesitation we can &quot;go therefore and make disciples . . . baptizing them.” Making disciples is a lot of work. But we enjoy it and, too, we appreciate so much God’s help in doing it</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May Jehovah’s rich blessing continue with you as you seek to accomplish liis purpose. Be assured of my warm love for all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brother,</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">a busy month March will be as we keep our ears open to hear what Jehovah so obviously wants us to do and then schedule our affairs to have a good share in doing it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Uppermost in our minds for this month will lie the Memorial, to be celebrated Sunday, March 22, after sundown. Knowing this to be the one celebration Jesus commanded his followers to keep, all of Jehovah’s people will surely do all In their power to be in attendance. We should start early in the month making a list of all those we will be helping to attend. Accounts servants can write on slips of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record sheets since January 19G9. Then these slips can lie given to study servants for distribution to publishers so these persons can be invited to the Memorial and special talk. Any who formerly associated but have not done so recently for one reason or another should be called on and warmly invited. There being no </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study or public talk on this Sunday, we can devote the entire day to field service and arranging to get interested ones to the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The special public talk for March 29 will be ‘‘The Road Back to Peace in Paradise.” This will be a manuscript prepared by the Society and will contain an abundance of meaty spiritual food. It is good for us from time to time to have an especially nourishing spiritual meal, one that requires close attention and concentration. But while this might be a talk with an abundance of spiritual food in it, do not for a moment hesitate to invite newer ones. There will be a great deal that they will grasp. The chairman in his closing comments at the Memorial can invite all in attendance to return on the following Sunday for this special talk. Then the talk should be widely advertised during the week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">13 min: “Building on a Right Foundation.” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Starting New Ones in Field Service. Talk. Member of committee discusses effort that will be made to get new ones who qualify out in March and April. Maybe we can have peak of publishers in March and another one in April. Must plan now. If publisher has question, then before inviting new one into the service, good to talk about it with overseer. Include thoughts from paragraph 27, page 149 of March 1, 1969, “Watchtower.&quot; Maybe read portions or entire paragraph. Refer to “Lamp” book pages 108, 129, 130. Mention, too, tile joy all will have in sharing in Held service this Memorial month, possibly sharing in establishing a peak in publishers. Be sure none are Irregular in March and April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: &quot;Your Invitation to the Lord’s livening Meal.” Two servants discuss article in March 15, 1970, &quot;Watchtower.” Their comments show how points in article can be used in inviting interested persons to Memorial. Mention is also made of how publisher and interested one can sit down and just read entire article together. Demonstrate use of Memorial invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Accounts servant's report. Explain arrangement for calling on all subscribers with invitation to Memorial and special talk. Halfway through &quot;Watchtower” campaign, so comment on progress to date in obtaining subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Congregation report and &quot;How Did We Do in January?&quot; Talking points on current magazines. Invite those who can vacation pioneer in April to get applications now. Song 83.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING MARCH 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Relying on Jehovah’s Spirit. (Luke 11:13) Song 80.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">17 min: “Relying on Jehovah’s Spirit.&quot; Questions and answers. Include experiences, local or otherwise, if time allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Letter from Brother Knorr, on page 1. Read and discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">16 min: Getting Interested Ones to the Kingdom Hall. Talk based on following 1970 “Yearbook” experiences: p. 105, par. 1, to p. 106, par. 2; p. 177, par. 1; p. 185, par. 2: p. 201, par. 3; p. 257, par. 2. and p. 284, par. 4. Note, we are talking not only about &quot;inviting” them to Kingdom Hall but “getting” them there. Have brief introduction and conclusion so as much time as possible can be spent on experiences themselves. Be sure to apply main point in each experience so it stands out. Applies also to getting them to Memorial and special talk. 12 min: Concluding comments. Make final comments regarding Memorial on Sunday. Mention article &quot;A Memorial Invitation.&quot; in March 22 “Awake!” Use it in final invitations to Memorial. If time permits, can demonstrate welcoming new ones to meeting. Progress to date on subscription campaign. Still time to vacation pioneer in April. Appropriate Announcements. Song 87.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">17 min: Presenting the Good News— &quot;Become 'Intensely Occupied with the Word.’ ” Discuss with audience. Chairman can comment on some paragraphs and ask questions on others. Be sure to emphasize the point that we need to make good use of our time. If studies are not progressing, then publishers should engage in the house-to-house work. Magazine-territory servant might be called on to give brief, up-to-date report on territory coverage. If covered often, stress need for thorough coverage. Can interview congregation publisher or pioneer who obviously enjoys house-to-house work and is effective therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Question Box. Possibly congregation servant can discuss this with others on committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “What Are You Doing About What .You Have Learned?” This material, in March 1, 1970, “Watchtower,” will be helpful to those with whom we are conducting home Bible studies. Encourage brothers to bring &quot;Watchtower” with them to this meeting. Present as talk, but draw brothers into discussion occasionally. Demonstrate briefly how material might be used to get student to appreciate what he is learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Make this positive and upbuilding, not negative. Use It to get students to progress and act; although, if no progress results, we will spend time more profitably in house-to-house work. Paul became intensely occupied with the word, meaning preaching and teaching. They should be progressing toward that end too. Maybe if we get them to meetings in March, the study need not be discontinued. 12 min: Concluding comments. Should have outstanding attendance at special talk jjext_^unday. All publishers and interested&quot; persons should be there. If some were at Memorial, then they are already acquainted with many. If not an excellent time to invite interested ones for first time.

<p><span class="font9">7 min: Talk on theme for April. See April 1, 1970, &quot;Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “What Do You Want Out of Life?” Discuss article in February 1, 1970, &quot;Watchtower.” Best if young publishers can handle this. Mature brother can be assigned to help and rehearse however. He must study material well and be acquainted with it. Young brother might introduce discussion with 3- or 4-minute talk. Other young publishers on platform can be quizzed on part of material, have round-table discussion on part, or just discuss how they feel points helped them to get solid view of proper goals for future. Important thing is for young publishers to see value of points made and how it applies to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Youthful Publishers Succeed by Faithfulness in the Ministry. 1970 &quot;Yearbook&quot; experiences, p. 128, par 1; p. 178. par. 1. Have very brief introduction and conclusion. Spend time relating or reading experiences and highlighting thought that young publishers have shown they can shoulder responsibility, witness to others effectively, maintain integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: “Do You Make Yourself Available?” Material from February 1, 1970, &quot;Watchtower.” Be sure to tie this in with the two assignments above. Possibly can be handled by father disepssing article with family at Monday-night family study. Different members of family voluntarily comment on how certain points apply to them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">10 min: Concluding comments. Song</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We have reached the halfway mark in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign. We will all want to cooperate with the magazine-territory servant in getting the territory completely and thoroughly worked with the subscription offer if at all possible. Besides offering subscriptions in the house-to-house work, have you offered them to those with whom you do business, to workmates and relatives?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It has been a pleasure for us to process so many applications for the vacation pioneer work for March and April. Could it be that these will be the best months yet for vacation pioneering? There is still time to share if you act quickly, \ Your congregation servant has the ' application you need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> Many blessings are in store for us during the month of March. Of course, really to make these blessings our own it will be necessary to hear, but, more so, to be busy doing what needs to be done. Then we will be building other ministers on a right foundation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah has again richly blessed our work. Last November's peak of 364,320 was bettered when 366,044 reported! Regular pioneers increased to 14,983 for another new peak! Obviously Jehovah’s servants want to have a share in the work yet to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And how are we doing in the subscription campaign? We obtained 191,242 subscriptions—the best January ever, by 44,605.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Did you notice $ the Bible study </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font9">average? We are back up to .7 again, and this is the best since last May. Keep up that fine building work.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Relying on Jehovah's Spirit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people are becoming more and more effective in preaching the good news. Personal and family study, attending and parti--•cipating in congregation meetings, along with experience in various features of the ministry, have made it possible for them to speak the truth with boldness and clarity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> But there are some who do not participate as fully as they could in the house-to-house work and other features of the service, apparently because they do not feel as capable as others. In some congregations about one-fourth of the publishers are irregular and quite a number put in less than five hours a month. Why is this so? Possibly their secular education was limited. Or, meeting people is not easy for them. There might be other reasons for their holding back.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Should these things cause one to draw back from fully participating In the ministry? Not really! Today, of all days, we should appreciate the part Jehovah’s spirit plays and how it will help us in the witness work that is being done. Jesus said to some of his disciples, “If you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!” (Luke 41:18) Jehovah is capable of making up for any lack that we might have.—Mark 13:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The Bible makes clear that the ingathering work being done world wide today is under angelic supervision. Jesus said, “When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, ... he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” (Matt. 25:31, 32) Haven’t we heard and read of many experiences of publishers recently who “called on just one more house” and found someone waiting for a Witness to call? Or of a publisher who was persistent in making a back-call or a not-at-home call and found someone Just waiting for the truth? Later they said it was as though an angel was guiding them to be sure that particular call was made. The angels can guide less-experienced publishers just as they can guide experienced ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In fact, the very capable and experienced publishers should also be sure to keep this in mind. Each of us should rely fully on Jehovah. One should not feel that what he is accomplishing is being done in Uis own strength. It has been ob-seitod that some publishers who might be thought to be less effective really have excellent results in the ministry. Often their joy Is greater than that of others because of the evidence that God’s spirit was with them in accomplishing something.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> A circuit servant says that when he works with publishers in the field ministry, instead of just standing there waiting for the householder to come to the door, he will offer a silent prayer in behalf of the publisher, praying that God’s spirit will assist the publisher in presenting the message well and also make the householder more receptive. It is good to ask Jehovah for his spirit before, during and after field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Another circuit servant says he can tell that publishers who rely heavily on Jehovah’s spirit are happier in their work. Thus, at a meeting for service, while he encourages the publishers to greater effectiveness in the ministry, offering suggestions for improvement, he also encourages them to look to Jehovah to bless their efforts. When the publishers approach the ministry from this standpoint they thank Jehovah appreciatively for the successes they experience and do not feel downhearted or discouraged if there is little or no response in the territory.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Announcements</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Regular pioneers serving since February 1, 1970, will be sent a cafeteria ticket with the March 15 pioneer letter, for use at a district assembly during this service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregation servants and pioneers: It will help us considerably if all pioneer reports are sent no later than the third day of the month and if the pioneer’s name (as listed with the Society) and address appear legibly. ♦ Offer for May: &quot;Then </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Is Finished the Mystery of God”</span><span class="font9"> with one booklet, for 50c. In making up orders for this book, congregation servants and literature servants can check movement of other 50c publications used in recent campaigns so that they will have enough for the publishers but not be overstocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ If overseers act immediately, there will still be time to order an increased supply of the special April 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and the special April 22 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">♦ There is still time for the overseer, it he feels it is appropriate, to arrange for those interested in vacation pioneer service during April to get together at a convenient time to discuss their plans. This will afford them an opportunity to work out arrangements among themselves and for the overseer to schedule group witnessing, if necessary, and otherwise offer assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Overseer should promptly mail Memorial report card after special public talk on March 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ In addition to the bound volumes of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> in English, they are also available in Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch French and German.

<p><span class="font9">• How can service meetings end on time when additional concluding comments must be made?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Service meetings should end on time. We should endeavor to begin the closing song by 9:30 p.m. if the opening song for the ministry school begins at 7:25 p.m. But at times the congregation servant must handle additional unexpected items in the concluding comments. Letters from the Society addressed to the congregation must be read and some letters from the circuit servant must be considered. Kingdom Hall repairs, remodeling or other matters may need to be handled. Deaths or illnesses of brothers in the congregation or certain disciplinary matters may need to be announced. Where will he get the additional time required to handle these things?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may be necessary for the congregation servant to make adjustments in the timing of other parts on the service meeting occasionally. Other brothers can be asked to condense the material in their assignments so as to present them in less time. These brothers, of course, should be notified as far in advance as possible in order to avoid last-minute adjustments on their part. On rare occasions an entire assignment can be eliminated and included in a later service meeting. There might also be times when the congregation servant can condense some of his comments or even eliminate some things that are not especially applicable to the congregation. Of course, for the overseer to have enough time the other brothers preceding him on the program will have to stay within their allotted time. When matters are handled in this way, the brothers are not deprived of information they should have and yet the meetings do not run overtime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Become “Intensely Occupied with the Word”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> After tile apostle Paul had done some tentmaking in Corinth with Aquila and Priscilla, the Bible account tells us at Acts 18:5, “when, now, both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ.” Was there good reason for Paul to become &quot;intensely occupied with the word”! Apparently so, for verses 9 and 10 go on to say, “Moreover, by night the Lord said to Paul through a vision: ‘Have no fear, but keep on speaking and do not keep silent . . . for I have many people in this city.’ ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Do we today have similar reasons for becoming intensely occupied with the word! Yes, because undoubtedly Jehovah still has “many people” in our territories that must be found and taught We should remind ourselves repeatedly of the urgency of the times in which we live and the need to share as fully as possible in the preaching and teaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When one has all day in which to do a job, the tendency often is to take all day. But when one has a great task to perform with only a limited amount of time in which to do it, the situation is different Then we look for more effective methods of doing the work and we put forth greater effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A little over a year ago we were introduced to the six-month home Bible-study program. We immediately grasped that this would be an additional effective method to help get the work done in the short time remaining.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Now reports from the field show that Bible studies are being discontinued as publishers realize that the student is not making progress. This is entirely proper. There Is no reason to spend our time with those who obviously are not really interested in doing something about the truths they are learning. Some publishers still ask, “How can I know whether to discontinue the study when they appear to be interested and still are glad to have me come?” The answer is that we discontinue studies when it is apparent that there is not the appreciation for the truth that there should be. There might be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">interest </span><span class="font10">in continuing to take in knowledge. But is there </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">appreciation</span><span class="font10"> for the knowledge already taken in? Appreciation for Jehovah and the truth is demonstrated by deeds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> There are three separate occasions each week for attending meetings or a total of seventy-eight in six months. If the student has not attended one of these meetings, when this is circumstantially possible, can it be said that there is appreciation? Or, if he has not, of his own initiative, or with your encouragement, done additional reading, can it be said that there is appreciation? Or, if he has not felt the urge to tell one of his friends or relatives about the good things he is learning, can it be said that there is appreciation? Each publisher will have to consider the matter carefully and then decide, but these thoughts will help in making that decision. Apparently the matter is being taken seriously by the brothers, because circuit servant reports show that many publishers unhesitatingly discontinue studies when the time comes to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Then what takes place? The time set aside for field service is now used in the house-to-house work. Jesus said, “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (Matt. 10:11) There are many territories in this country that are worked less than once in six months. Additionally, many of these are not worked thoroughly. Surely we can do a great deal more in the ‘searching’ work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> What, then, is it that appears to be especially needed now in order to become “intensely occupied with the word”? Very likely it is a good balance between the Bible-study work and the house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> There are a number of different approaches one can take in the house-to-house work with the starting of Bible studies in view. Note what one district servant writes concerning starting studies on the initial call: “Regarding starting Bible studies I have been having some very fine experiences offering the study first thing in speaking to</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> With this proper view, both the less-experienced and experienced publishers are happy in the service. So, if occasionally you feel somewhat inadequate, prepare to the extent of your ability and then schedule your affairs to have a good share in the work. Success will not come in your own strength. God is the one who causes growth.—1 Cor. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">3: 6, 7.</span><span class="font10">' people at their doors. As I am work ing mostly with brothers I havq had to arrange for a sister to return and in some cases have been able to take them back with me later in the week. I have had more joy in the field as a result, as I feel it has provided a more meaningful ministry for me.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Having this view of the house-to-house work and its place in starting home Bible studies has made it possible for a number of publishers to have more than one study with the public going at one time and thus they are not left without a study when it comes time to discontinue one. Then, too, they keep in touch with those whose study was discontinued to see if appreciation has been built up by the loss of the study or for other reasons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Excellent work has been done recently. What has been accomplished has unquestionably been pleasing to Jehovah. But is it possible for some of us to become even more “intensely occupied with the word,” just as Paul was? This is really what we desire, isn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>

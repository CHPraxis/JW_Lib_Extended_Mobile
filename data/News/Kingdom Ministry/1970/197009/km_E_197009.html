<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER 1970</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Go therefore and make disciples . . . baptizing them.&quot;—Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL XIII NO. 9</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>’EKingdoin ^PubCisliCftS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Here at Bethel we are still thinking and talking about the delightful “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly that we attended this summer. And there is so much to talk about I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">None of us has forgotten the thrilling drama of Mordecai and Esther. It was not just the story that was impressive but what it means to us. How forcefully it was shown that we need to be sure that personal differences never weaken the bond of love that unites us! So deep should be our concern for every one of our brothers and sisters that we would risk our lives to help them. That is something to think about, isn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What was said about the heart was also impressive. Did you get the new thought? It was interesting to learn that Bible references to the -.iinnan heart have to do with the nleshly heart itself, not something that is merely figurative. But what we here at Bethel have been talking about even more is the admonition that was given to examine our hearts regularly and to be honest with ourselves as to why we do things, to search out our weaknesses and work on remedying them. In this way our hearts will be found acceptable to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we think back on the highlights of the program, we also remember the identification of the “disgusting thing” with the scarletcolored beast of Revelation chapter 17, the United Nations. That is something that folks had been asking about ever since the assemblies last year. It was also faith-strengthening to hear the talk “We Worship What We Know” and to see how true that is in oui' case, in contrast with prac-ticers of false religion. And do you recall the note of urgency in the talk “Taking Final Advantage of the ‘Year of Goodwill’”? Talks such as those make us want to do all we can in Jehovah's service, don’t they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then there was the Saturday-night program “Who Needs Your • Help?” When we left the assembly</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Evolution o</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">r Creation?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many do not take time to read the Bible or show serious concern about its direction because of the widespread belief that evolution accounts for the universe and man’s presence—not creation, as outlined in the Bible. But did man get here by evolution or by creation? Thinking people do well to examine the facts. The publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </span><span class="font10">sets forth ‘the other side of the picture’ in a well-documented presentation. We will be offering it to everyone we can during September on a contribution of 25 cents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">grounds that evening, the points made were vivid in our minds. But they soon fade if we don’t review them. Don’t you agree that it would be beneficial to review frankly within each family circle the helpful counsel that was given to safeguard both young folks and older ones? When the apostle Peter wrote to his brothers, he said that by reminding them of things that they had heard he wanted to ‘rouse them up.’ (2 Pet. 1:12, 13) That is something that we need to do for one another today too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have heard that the total attendance at the public talk at the assemblies was over half a million —actually 523,799. That is just for the United States. And at these assemblies from late June till early August, 10,527 were baptized. Isn’t that grand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The assembly did so much to help all of us as God’s “men of goodwill” to prepare for the approaching millennial peace. Now, during September and the mouths to come, there is work for each one of us to do in helping others to make such preparation too. May Jehovah bless you as you share to the full in this grand privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of our warm love for each one of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Bbanch Office</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It would be a fine thing if all of your congregation’s territory could be covered with this offer. Why not make this a goal in your congregation and see what you can do along this line. It may be that, with increased effort by all in the house-to-house work, and with the good weather we usually enjoy in September during the day and in the evening, you can succeed in covering most, if not all, of your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many of you have new territory to work, virtually untouched, and that is in the schools. We previously put forth an effort to contact educators with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book, but that was two years ago. Many teachers and school officials have changed since then. People have changed their minds on many subjects too. If you are a student, a new year at school will put you with new teachers, and often new students.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> During September, when the school year starts, many of you parents have opportunity to get acquainted with the teachers, counselors and principals where your children attend. Tell them of your pleasure in reading the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font10">book and suggest that they might like to read it too.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> And you publishers who are attending school, will you offer the book to your teachers? How? you may ask. After class, or after school, you could approach your science teacher and tell him that you and your parents are interested in scientific subjects and enjoyed reading the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book. Suggest that he might enjoy reading it too. And in your history class, does not the discussion usually begin with the consideration of evolution? You might choose to raise your hand during class and comment that you read a publication that said man</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1970 378,040 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most outstanding is the fact that 9,941 were baptized during July, which brings the total baptized thus far for the service year to 38,021! How glad we are to have these newly dedicated ones associated with us. And how thankful we are to Jehovah that he has blessed us so richly in the disciplemaking work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The report shows also that 521,726 books were placed, which amounts to one or more placed by each of us, on the average. And 6,150,727 magazines were placed. If tw’o magazines were placed at a time in most cases, it may be that we left literature in some three million homes in the one month . of July! What a grand witness! As we continue to follow up the interest manifest, we pray that Jehovah will bless us in this work too.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How Are They Doing? Can You Help?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has blessed our work with much fruitfulness. Here in the United States during the first ten months of the past service year over *S*!4,600 additional publishers joined us in Jehovah’s service! Incomplete reports for the year indicate that over 38,000 were baptized! It may be that some of these are associated with your congregation. You may have studied with some of them, and if so, we know it has been a source of great joy to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> These new ones that you have helped along in the truth to this point—how are they doing? Are they coming to meetings regularly? In many cases, no doubt, the answer is Yes. Are they having some share in commenting at the meetings? You may say, “Yes.” Are they sharing regularly in the ministry? Many of them are, and we know this brings you much joy. Are they making as much progress now as they did when</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Evolution or Creation? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">got here by creation, not evolution. Or, you may wish to approach your teacher after class and tell him what you read and ask him if he would like to read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font10">book too. Tell other children about 1 ft; talk freely about what you have , jead. Adults usually cannot go into ’nhe school and witness to the children. But you are there every day. As you talk you can accomplish much good, and may stir up fine interest among the 44 million young people in school in this country who often do not hear the message we bring when we go from house to house.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> It may be that some congregations can make arrangements for a talk to be given in the schools when the subject of evolution is being discussed. There are no doubt many teachers who would be very pleased to know that there is someone in their community who has enough interest in the children and their education to be willing to take time to come in and talk to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We suggest that the overseer and school servant determine whether or not anyone in the congregation might do well in making such a presentation. Then it would be well to check with the brother to see if he is willing and can arrange his affairs to give such a talk during school hours, if something can be arranged • with the school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Speakers should arrange their own presentations. It is suggested they were first learning the truth and beginning to associate? In some cases, you will say, “No.” Then, what can you do to help?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How long has it been since you visited these new ones in their homes? When you were conducting the study you used to go faithfully each week, In foul weather and fair. Would a visit now be helpful? Undoubtedly it would be. And if you go prepared to discuss something that you know will be beneficial to them, it will undoubtedly prove to be a great aid spiritually to these new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What might you discuss? Well, how are they doing in personal study? Are they studying as regularly now as they used to when they prepared for their Bible study each week? Or have their habits along this line been slipping? Why not discuss it with them. You could take along your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lamp”</span><span class="font10"> book and that, while mention may be made of a few of the more glaring weaknesses in the evolution theory, emphasis in the presentation be placed on the evidence in favor of creation. The speaker can decide if he wishes to open the discussion for questions or not. In conclusion the class and teachers can be told that, if more information of a scientific nature is desired, it is available in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book at a cost of 25 cents each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Where speakers are available, the overseer can arrange for a qualified publisher to contact the teachers. The one who will be doing this can Inform the teachers that, when evolution is discussed in school, he will be glad to arrange for a qualified speaker to come and give a talk to the class presenting ‘the other side’ of the picture, thus giving the class a broader view of the subject. The speaker will be glad to present some of the facts in favor of creation for the purpose of informing the class, if this is desired. The teacher may wish to check with the principal and make arrangements for such a presentation later in the school year, and this, of course, would be just fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> As we give the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book a good distribution from house to house in September, and as we follow through on the other suggestions above, surely Jehovah will direct things so that a fine witness is given. go over the material on pages 67-09 and 209 together. No doubt such a discussion would make your visit spiritually refreshing, very encouraging and long appreciated. Perhaps occasionally, or regularly, you could prepare together for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font10">study, the book study or the ministry school, or engage in a research project on a subject that needs consideration with these comparatively new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Do they need help to be effective in the house-to-house work, possibly assistance in preparing to work with the sermon? Do they need help to get into the back-call work, or assistance in getting a study started? Reading together and discussing appropriate material in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lamp&quot; </span><span class="font10">book under the headings “Preaching from House to House,” “Back-Calls” or “Home Bible Studies,” on pages 85-100, would no doubt be a source of many practical, encouraging suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Will some need encouragement to enroll in the ministry school, or help in preparing for a student assignment? There may be a problem that has slowed the family down and aid is needed in finding the Scriptural principles that apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> To illustrate this need for assistance: With young children it usually takes a comparatively short period of time before they can understand the language of their parents </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 4, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font10"> 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pursuit of Maturity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you considered that your regularly conducting a Bible study could contribute greatly to your pursuit of maturity? It can. To conduct the study well, there is a need for you to prepare your lesson ahead of time, and to pay particular attention to how the scriptures cited or quoted can prove the points under consideration. When you ask the householder the reason why he believes a certain answer is correct, you too must search your mind for a reason why the answer is correct. When the householder asks a question, if you do not have the answer in mind or at hand, you will have to do research in the Society’s publications and in the Bible to find the Scriptural answer to the question. Yes, it has always been true that the one conducting the study benefits in many ways. There are times when he learns more than the student does.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In calling back on individuals who received copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book, will you endeavor to get studies started in this publication? The last four chapters of the publication lend themselves well to Bible study. You can make up your own questions if you would like. Or, you can read a few paragraphs together, perhaps covering a full subheading at a time, and then discuss it together, or ask some questions to see if they get the point of the information. It may be that, after a few calls, you will want to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book and help them further by studying with them in this publication. If you would like help in getting a home Bible study started, we feel sure that the Bible study servant In your congregation, your book study servant, or another mature brother or sister will be glad to help you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In our pursuit of maturity there is a need for all of us to be regular in personal study and Bible reading too. Do you set aside some time regularly for personal reading of the Bible and the Society’s publications? Many individuals and families do this in connection with their discussion of the day's text at mealtime or another convenient time. If you are a parent, are you regularly conducting a family study for your benefit and the benefit of the members of your family?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Regular meeting attendance is also an important factor in our pursuit of maturity. The Scriptures cotinsel us to be careful not to forsake meeting together regularly and making public declaration of our faith, which we can do by having a part In the meetings and commenting when it is appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Remember the counsel of the apostle Paul at Hebrews 5:12-14: “You ought to be teachers in view of the time . . . solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained.” Yes, In our pursuit of maturity we should USE the knowledge we are regularly taking in. We should use it in making necessary changes in our lives, use it in teaching the members of our families, use it in teaching others in the Bible study work, and use it in commenting at meetings. Our following such a course will undoubtedly’ contribute much to our pursuit of maturity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How Aro Thoy Doing? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and express themselves quite clearly in it. Yet it takes much longer for them to grow to maturity. Growing up takes time. Parents realize this and lovingly spend the necessary time to aid and direct their children. Similarly, many who are lovers of righteousness become acquainted with the. ‘pure language’ and, in a few months, develop a good ability to express themselves in it. But there is much more to learn, and it takes time to grow spiritually and become strong in the truth. We ma.y be able to be of considerable help to one another along this line. So, ‘as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good, especially’ toward those related to us in the faith.’ As we continue to help one another make progress, surely Jehovah’s blessing will go with us. —Gal. 6:10; Heb. G: 10.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Question ffiox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">• What can be done with older books on hand in the congregation literature supplies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a first suggestion, perhaps you would like to obtain some of the<sup>-</sup>publications from your literature sv , vant. if you have one or more with you in your witnessing case, you will* find appropriate opportunities to offer them. When working in rural territory or other territory not often worked, you might choose to include one of these older publications in your offer. Feel free to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would be a fine thing, also, to encourage those on whom you are making back-calls and with whom you are conducting studies to read some of these older publications. Such reading will be of great benefit to them spiritually.—Prov. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are newly associated with Jehovah’s organization, how many of these older publications have you read? Check with your literature servant to see what publications are available. You may wish to add some of these to your library and read them as you have opportunity.—Prov. 9:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Circuit servants can take note of congregations that have stocks of older books and make this information known to nearby congregations as they visit. Literature servants may feel free to inquire of nearby congregations and of their circuit servant too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servants should use good judgment in ordering literature supplies. Do not guess in ordering. If you will check your progressive literature inventory to see how many of the same kind of books were placed during previous campaigns, you will be in a better position to determine how many will be needed for coming campaigns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1968 “Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.”—Mark 13:10. VOL. XI NO. 10</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^eax ^PuWiskeiiS:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">What a day we had at the Jehovah’s Witnesses Assembly Hall here in New York city, Sunday, September 8! It was graduation day for the ninety-nine students of Gilead’s -46th class. The president, the vice-president, Gilead instructors and Bethel overseers all had outstanding spiritual admonition to offer. In the afternoon the graduates themselves put on an excellent program of music and drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many are now on their way to faraway assignments. It surely makes us very happy to note their zeal. They became very dear to us during their stay, but now a new class—the 47th—made up of students from many lands will take their place. By October 16 the Bethel Family will once more have the pleasure of close association with another group of Gilead students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The other day Brother Knorr made a very significant announcement : The Kingdom Ministry School, during the next ten months, will operate at the Society’s property in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, instead of here in Brooklyn. Brothers in Pittsburgh will gladly house the students during their two weeks at school. Why this change? So that the Bethel Family can be increased considerably in number, so as to be able to cope with the great amount of work that is to be done. In this way it will be possible to operate a night shift, and keep the presses and other machines busy some seventeen hours every day. In fact, the night shift got started on Monday night, September 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This, we are sure, will make all of you very happy. We have your many orders for literature, but have not had sufficient supplies to fill them all. The demand for literature world wide has been tremendous. Now, with the addition of a night shift as well as added equipment, we hope within a few months to be able to fill all your requirements in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And we know that you are all very busy too. The August report</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Making Known an Urgent Message</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A few weeks ago you heard a letter read to your congregation about the October 8 special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> But by now you no doubt have your own copy, and you have seen for yourself what it contains. Isn’t it fine? How appropriate this material is for our magazine that bears the title “Awake!” With a powerful array of facts, persuasive argument and visual aids it drives home the point that we really are living&quot; in the “last days.” Kindly but firmly it emphasizes the fact that the time left is very short and that, if a person wants to serve God and survive into his righteous new system, he must take the necessary steps now. This is what people everywhere need to realize, isn’t it? (2 Tim. 4:2) What a privilege it will be to take this upbuilding message to them during October!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> No doubt, the majority of the magazines will be placed in the regular house-to-house work. Isn't that where you place most of yours? So our effectiveness in getting this information to the public will be greatly influenced by the amount of time that we are able to spend in calling at their homes to offer the magazines. Do you personally have a day each week set aside for magazine work? Even if you find that indicates that you converted August from a vacation month into a working month—the second-best of the entire service year. Isn’t that wonderful? With such reports coming in, we are anxious to see the material that will be compiled for the new YearfiooJr. And, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we may all hope to make the new service year the greatest yet in praise to Jehovah. Have a good time with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazine in October, and may Jehovah’s blessing go with all of you as you follow our Fine Shepherd.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">difficult to do on a regular basis, could you do it during October? Consider the matter prayerfully. If you are able to do so, we urge you to have that added share in this special work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, during October we are going to be trying to get this special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> into the hands of people that we do not regularly contact in our witness work. We hope that you will carefully analyze your own territory and consider whom you do not often meet. Is it the men whom you seldom find at home? Then might it not be beneficial to try some evening magazine work? Are there residents of old folks homes that you rarely see? What about those in college dormitories, seamen's hotels, prisons, military installations, etc.? In many territories there are large apartment houses with doormen, and hotels with permanent residents. When did you last witness to these people? Can you arrange to get this special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> to them? They need the message just as urgently as others do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What about your business territory? Many of the people that we seldom find at home can be reached at their place of business. If you make it a point to call at the stores and office buildings in your territory with this special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> you will have a fine time. And, after talking to the manager, why not ask for permission to offer the magazines briefly to his clerks? If you are to the point, he may be quite willing, as long as they are not busy with customers at the time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Obtaining Subscriptions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> During October we will not be featuring bound books in the field ministry, though there is no objection to placing a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book with someone who seems to be a good prospect for a home Bible study. For this month the Society’s printing facilities are</span></p></li></ul>

This is excellent to use when demonstrating study on first call, or on first back-calL Generally, just reading together the information In the opening paragraphs will be sufficient to arouse Interest. The illustration on page 4 may be helpful. You may want to have the householder look up the majority of scriptures in chapter 1, whether quoted or not, and then after discussing the paragraphs have material read from the book, so he will see that the book really Is in harmony with his own Bible. It may require more than one call to cover this first chapter, depending on the response of the householder.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">An Urgent Message &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">geared to provide us with magazines, so It is best to concentrate on placing individual copies and obtaining subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Where can the subscriptions best be obtained? Most of them are obtained in the regular house-to-house work, as you know, but there are other prospects too. For example, there are persons with whom you conduct studies, others on whom you make back-calls, deliverymen and repairmen who come to your home, your grocer and druggist, the barber and beautician, gas station attendants, workmates, school friends and teachers. Why not make a personal list of prospects, and then check them off after you have tried each one? If you do, you are sure to have a productive month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup>Awake!</span><span class="font10"> has proved to be an effective instrument in directing persons of right heart to the true worship of God. It provides wholesome, upbuilding reading for the entire family. It is practical In outlook. Its articles build one’s confidence In the Bible and help one to see how Bible principles bear on the many facets of everyday life. It discusses the topics that people are talking about, and shows that God’s kingdom provides the answer that they are seeking. Don’t you agree that it is something we can wholeheartedly encourage them to read regularly? Let’s do that this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Of course, the time we are able to devote to the field service is limited by our personal circumstances. So it Is important to make good use of the time we have. Well-organized service arrangements will help to avoid wasting our time waiting in cars or standing on street corners waiting for others. With careful planning, we can make the best possible use of the time actually giving the witness, and that Is what we all want to do. It is important that we do so, because the message is urgent!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Folder to Advertise Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>Has your congregation received its supply of the new four-page folder entitled “Would You Like to Understand the Bible?” If not, they will be sent to you just as soon as your congregation submits its next order for other literature that may be needed, A supply of about fifty copies per publisher is being consigned, free of charge, to each congregation. Use them well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Society is keenly interested in the Bible-study work, and we know that you are too. Our desire is, not merely to place literature with people, but to study the Bible with them regularly. With the aid of the simple presentation of material in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, this is something that every publisher can do, don’t you agree? We believe that this folder will help you to start studies. Why? Because it is designed to stimulate the interest of anyone who reads it, and it clearly answers the questions that they normally have when we offer to study with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If you have your supply of these folders during October, we suggest that you start using them right</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Ready for November?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Have you personally offered the new book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</span><span class="font10"> in the field ministry as yet? Are you using it on your home Bible studies? If so, we don’t need to tell you how easy it Is to place or how clearly it presents the truth. You know for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the question is, Will your congregation have enough copies to supply the needs of all the publishers for the entire month of November, when we will all be featuring the new book in the field ministry? We hope so, and, with that in mind, we encourage all congregations that need more books to order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It would be advisable for the congregation servant to estimate the rate at which the stock Is moving and then order a sufficient supply so that, by November 1, the congregation will have on hand at least four </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> books for every publisher and twenty for each regular and vacation pioneer. If there are opportunities In your territory to use some of the available foreign editions, obtain them too. Even if your congregation was not able to get as many books as you wanted at an earlier date, we believe that the Society’s factory will be in position to handle all of your orders in time for the November campaign. So, be sure that you are well supplied for a productive month of service. away. Endeavor to leave one with each person to whom you witness, whether he obtains literature or not. Slip a copy under the door where the people are not at home. Put them in any free copies of magazines that you provide for apartment-house dwellers and others. And wherever you leave the Bible-study folder, include a handbill to inform the reader where he can get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses locally, or you may write your own name and address or phone number on the folder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In the months to come, whenever you place a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book, we recommend that you slip one of these folders into the book. Then, when you make your return visit, they will know exactly why you have come. It will make it easier to start Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> How fine it would be to cover your entire territory with this Bible-study folder! If, in order to do that, you need more than are being sent, ask the publishers to check to see how many they have left in their own literature eases, and use them first. If they are all actually being put to good use out in the field ministry, you are welcome to order more, free of charge, but in quantities of no more than fifty per publisher. It is by means of home Bible studies that people can most effectively be aided to learn the truth and take their stand on Jehovah’s side. Let’s all share fully in this work.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> For two months now, at our congregation book studies, we have been considering Part 2 of the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Babylon the Great Has Fallen!&quot; God's Kingdom Rules!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If you have been moving along at a steady pace in your study group, then by the middle of October you will no doubt be starting chapter 21. That is where the very timely information from chapters 14 through 22 of Revelation begins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> At the congregation book study we have no set number of pages to cover, as we do for our weekly </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study. This gives us opportunity to discuss matters more fully, to be sure that they are really understood, and we appreciate it when the study&quot; conductor helps us to do that. But that does not mean that we need to slow down to the extent that we are covering only a few paragraphs each week. Even when the material is weighty, it should not be difficult to cover at least five pages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you are going at a slower pace than this, it may be that you need to focus more of your attention on the points covered by the printed study questions. If someone in the group works in comments on other details in the paragraphs, that is fine, but it is not necessary for the study conductor to formulate questions on all these other details.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> It is good- to take time to look up and read scriptures that are cited but not quoted. In fact, as you study the material that is actually verse-by-verse commentary, some publishers may want to follow it with their Bibles opened. As for any lengthy Scripture citations, the study conductor may use his own judgment about having them read; in some cases, he may simply arrange for a brief summary of their contents by someone who has been notified In advance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> To Impress principal thoughts on the mind, brief oral reviews are helpful. But there is no need for these to be extensive. They are intended for review of key thoughts, not all the details. Handled in this way, they will not slow down progress but will help us to retain points that we should know well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Are you attending the congregation book study each week? By all means do so. Fully understanding the prophecies now being discussed will help all of us to appreciate the work that God is now having done, and it will prepare us for the momentous events that lie immediately ahead of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN AUGUST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A most encouraging report, indeed! The total of 332,834 publishers for August is just slightly below our former peak of 333,672 in April. This is the first time we have ever been so close to reaching a former peak in August. Actually, the figure is an increase of 5.4 percent over August of last year. In addition, there was a new peak of 11,808 pioneers reporting. What a fine conclusion to our service year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">August also saw a new peak of 822,733 in book placements, well above the previous peak of 793,317 in May of this year. No doubt many of these placements were of the “Truth” book. With such a fine Instrument already in the hands of so many people, we can really be enthusiastic about the prospects for starting many Bible studies In the coming months, can’t we? We rejoice with you in this thrilling conclusion to our 1968 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ing on page 8 is the evidence you need to answer this question.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Another brief presentation could be this: “I’m calling because of the concern we all have about the increase in crime and violence everywhere. So many people wonder what it all means and what the future holds. This issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font10">‘Is It Later Than You Think?’ gives the best collection of information on this matter I have ever read.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It is often beneficial to tie the presentation in with some specific point in the magazine. You may want to turn to the section beginning on page 17, which is entitled “A Grand Future Ahead in God’s Neiv Order.” I.et the householder see the heartwarming illustrations that portray what life will be like after the end of this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If we choose to feature the October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> which contains the fine public talk from the district assemblies, “Man’s Rule About to Give Way to God’s Rule,” we might say: &quot;I’m calling because of the interest we all have in good government. Wouldn’t it be a fine thing if the whole earth had a government that could guarantee peace, prosperity and happiness to everybody? [Allow response.] The Bible promises that within this generation this earth will have just such a government. Read about it in this article, ‘Man’s Rule About to Give Way to God’s Rule.’ [Refer to article.] Along with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">it is yours for only 10 cents.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• Is it ever appropriate to arrange to put on dramas in the Kingdom Halls or at circuit assemblies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In recent years the Society has been using some dramas for the district assemblies. However, these are special features of the district assemblies, and it is recommended that this method of communicating information not be employed in the Kingdom Halls or at circuit assemblies. Organizing and putting on dramas require a great amount of time, and sometimes considerable expense. Much time is used in writing a script, becoming familiar with the parts and rehearsing, besides making up costumes and props. We believe that much of this time could be spent more profitably in the field ministry and in personal study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstrations are called for in the “Kingdom Ministry” outline of service meetings, of course, and they may also .be used at circuit assemblies. But these are different from the dramas. These demonstrations do not require detailed script, and it is neither necessary nor advisable to go to a lot of work to prepare special costumes or props. In nearly every case, we believe, the brothers and sisters taking part can use their regular daily attire. The things that they say usually suffice to identify the role they are taking, and the rest can be left to the imagination of the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The important thing with any demonstration is. not to entertain, but to convey practical Instruction to the audience. A presentation that is simple and to the point generally accomplishes this most effectively. So, when these demonstrations are rehearsed, the one in charge should have in mind that they are to be simple, practical and Informative, not elaborate dramatic productions.</span></p>

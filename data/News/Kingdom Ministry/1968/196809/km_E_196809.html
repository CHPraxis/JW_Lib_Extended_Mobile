<p><span class="font10">What an exciting summer it has been! Members of the Bethel family have attended many assemblies, but principally the one in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, all of us now know about the new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book that was released. In Washington we distributed 160.000 copies to those present. The book has been greeted enthusiastically everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our production departments have been hard pressed to meet the demand for this new publication. Some congregations have ordered 20 copies per publisher, but we have had to reduce orders to about five per publisher until we have a supply on hand. Remember, brothers, we are making shipments of this hook to many parts of the earth. However, please continue to order. While we may not always be able to send what you request, you can always reorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have sold 251 acres of Kingdom Farm at South Lansing, New York, including the buildings where Gilead School and the Kingdom Ministry School used to be located. The State of New York made the purchase and will make use of the buildings and land. We still have 550 acres in that vicinity that we are farming in order to supply food for the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have erected and are now using a fine new building at Watchtower Farm, about 100 miles from New York City. We are also continuing with other building work there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Across the street from Bethel the concrete work for the new home is up to the fourth floor. As yet no brick work or inside work has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh, yes. we are currently conducting an all-Spanish session of the Kingdom Ministry School. It is certainly fine to have our Spanish brothers with us and they are very happy and rejoice to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the Bethel family are away on vacation right now, but by September 1 we ought to be in full</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">What Lies Ahead?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A vigorous preaching of the good news of the Kingdom to imperiled mankind is one thing that lies ahead. In reflecting on the report for the United States during the 1968 service year, it is a delight to observe that a total of 333,672 shared in Jehovah’s service in April! This is the most we have ever had engage in the witness work in any one month in this country. Also, 5,926,076 hours were spent in the ministry in April, 213,221 subscriptions were obtained, and 308,118 studies were conducted; in February there were 11,572 regular pioneers in the service. And all these are new peaks for the United States, brothers! What a wonderful time we have had together in Jehovah's service! Yet at our district assemblies this summer we were all impressed with the shortness of the time and the urgency of the work that is ahead of us. With over 680,000 attending the Memorial in this country there are undoubtedly many people in our territory hungering for tlie truth that makes men free. Do we have a program to assist these hungering people during the 1969 service year? Yes, and a fine one!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In the months of September and October we are going to have special public talks in all congregations across the land. They are to acquaint interested ones with basic swing again, able to take care of all of the orders for the new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, to us the date “September 1” means the beginning of a new service year, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we hope to make It our biggest and best as we work diligently in showing imperiled mankind the way to true security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of our warm love for all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">and vital Bible truths and help them appreciate the need to act. It will be of great benefit to interested ones if they will adjust their affairs to attend, and we want to urge them and help them to do so. We might liken these talks to a nine-point program </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> Bible education. They will last nine weeks, with different vital Bible teachings being considered each week. Encourage interested ones to be at the Kingdom Hall at least one hour each week so as to get the full impact and benefit of this program. These talks will unquestionably prove to be a great aid in directing imperiled mankind to the way of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> All of us are anxious to put into practice the information provided at the district assembly with regard to our speeded-up program in the Bible-study work. In Presenting the Good News in this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> you will find some suggestions that will aid you in this. So we will say no more about it here, except this—when we follow suggestions given by Jehovah’s organization for spreading the good news, we find that rich blessings result, isn’t that true? We are confident that this will be your happy lot as you share fully in this new program for Bible-study activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Our year’s text for 1968 encourages “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) So during this month of September we will be sharing in this all-important work from house to house. We will be offering the new book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</span><span class="font10"> for a contribution of 25c. Or, if your supply is depleted, you may offer either one book or a combination of two books, using </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting, 'Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution,</span><span class="font10"> if you wish. A booklet may be given free with each of the large-size books. Point out to interested ones that the contents of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font10"> 3)</span></p>

But why is there so much of it? And what is the remedy? [Let householder answer.] I believe you will be interested in what is stated here in the Bible at 2 Timothy 3.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Hello. I’m engaged in a community service. It has to do with the spirit of violence and rebellion that seems to be rising up everywhere. Serious people wonder just how it will all end up. Some wonder if it is an evidence of the ‘end’ that the Bible predicts. We are encouraging people to give thought to what the Bible has to say. What is happening is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Note what it says here at 2 Timothy 3.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1968 342,516 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You will be delighted to know that during July 326,062 publishers shared in the service. That means that this July close to 15,000 more publishers and pioneers snared in Jehovah's service than did during July last year. Isn’t that a fine report? You will also be happy to know that the report includes 11,627 regular pioneers, which Is a new peak for the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet, the big news is how enthusiastic you brothers have been about offering the “Truth&quot; book to others. July's report shows that 645,090 books were placed—well over twice the number placed last July! Just think how many back-calls we now have to make as we offer to study with these people and help them learn the truth that leads to eternal life!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SPECIAL PUBLIC TALKS FOR SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font11">OW thrilled we all were when the speaker at our recent district assembly announced the release of the striking new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life!</span><span class="font11"> In view of the short time left before this system of things ends, it is just the teaching aid we need to help honest-hearted persons learn quickly the lifesaving truths of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Adding to our joy is the arrangement that has been made to help us become familiar with the entire book quickly so that we can use it effectively right away. This is one reason why the nine special public talks to be delivered during September and October will be based exclusively on the material found in the twenty-two chapters of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Meetings to Help You</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider how you personally will be enriched and blessed by these nine special talks. They will afford you the opportunity to devote between eight and nine hours of public-meeting time to get well acquainted with the fine information in the new book. This will build up your own appreciation of basic Bible truths, and it will enable you to get in clear focus the main points of each chapter, the Scriptural arguments and helpful illustrations. Just think what a help that will be during the months ahead!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a result of being well acquainted with the book, you will be able to use it to the best advantage in your house-to-house ministry and when doing incidental witnessing. You will know where to turn to find the information that best fits the needs of each person to whom you talk. Furthermore, this program of preparation will help you to conduct truly progressive home Bible studies with those who show • &lt;'i sincere desire to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Bring your personal study copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book with you when you attend each of these special public talks. Then as the speaker covers the points, you can follow him in your open book. And when he invites the audience to comment- on certain paragraphs, you can answer from your open book. Bring your Bible-study students too with their new book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now, is there something that you individually can do to make sure that you get the greatest benefit from these meetings? Yes, there is. If you will make it a point, each week, to go through the assigned chapters in advance, even doing so quickly, and mark the answers to the study questions, it will be most beneficial. Having marked the basic answers, you will be able to concentrate more of your attention on the finer points brought out in the talk, the arguments used and the illustrations that support them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You are going to prepare for home Bible studies in this book sometime. Why not do it now? Then you will be ready to conduct a study in any chapter in the book, and week by week, before going to your studies, you will need only a few minutes to glance at the points that you have marked in order to refresh your mind. The effort you put forth now will save you many hours during the months to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, if someone is unable to study the material in advance, he surely will not want to miss hearing the talks. As each talk is given, he will be able to mark points in the margin of his book and perhaps underscore some of the answers in each chapter. Of course, being present to hear the talks will also build us all up spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Remember, there are nine of these special talks, one each Sunday during September and October. Make it your determination to be present every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Interested Persons</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another reason why we are having this special series of public talks is to benefit the persons with whom we arc already conducting home Bible studies and anyone else who shows interest. Some of these people have had studies conducted with them for a number of months; others, for a number of years. But are they acting on what they have learned? If you are able to arrange for them to be present for this entire series of talks, it could well mark a major turning point in their lives. Their being present for these talks could, in many cases, do more good than many months of study apart from the congregation. Be enthusiastic about building up their interest in these special meetings. Explain that this is a program that is being put on in every congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States during September and October only. Let them know that the material has been specially selected for the benefit of those who are studying the Bible in their homes with Jehovah’s witnesses. Emphasize attending the entire series of talks, if at all possible. Arrange to bring them with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some of the persons with whom studies are being conducted have never been to a Kingdom Hall. But that is an important step in one’s spiritual growth. If, as a result of enthusiastic support of this special series of public talks, you are able to get them to come to these congregation meetings, what a blessing it will be to them! It will make their home study more meaningful, and it will do more than words can ever accomplish in helping them to appreciate that Jehovah truly does have an organization on the earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Speakers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are a few basic points that you brothers who are going to give these talks should keep in mind in order to deliver them effectively. As you look over your assigned material you will notice that there is plenty of it. Since all the material for your talk is in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book, you should not go to other publications to search out additional material nor should you use scriptures not found in the chapters you are covering. Use only the material in the chapters assigned. This is the material that the Society has provided for these talks. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Remember that these talks are designed to help your brothers become familiar with the contents of the “Truth” book!</span><span class="font11"> They will want to follow you in their books. To help them do this, you need to present the material in the exact order it appears in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To prepare well, thoroughly familiarize yourself with the information in the appropriate chapters. Below you will find the title for each talk and the chapters assigned to it along with suggestions on how to present the material. Read these carefully. In most chapters the main points have been clearly indicated; these should be constantly liighlighted as you deliver your talk. You can do this by repeating them, also by listing them on a chart or blackboard. By your making the few main points for each chapter very clear the brothers will see what points deserve special emphasis when teaching others. So give careful consideration to this matter and handle your material in such a way that it all emphasizes the key points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Note that most of the outlines below contain a few scriptures. These appear in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book, but they are listed here to indicate that you should plan to use them. If time will not allow you to read them all, just quote or paraphrase some. You may want to ask certain publishers ahead of time to be prepared to read selected texts from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Remember, it is our hope that many new ones will be present. Speak with them in mind. Be emphatic. Be enthusiastic. Be clear. Use the same sincerity and conviction you would use in talking to such persons in their homes during a Bible study. Be sure to emphasize what the audience should do about what they are learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A number of recommendations are given to add variety to your presentation. If at all possible, follow them. However, you will have to take into consideration what you have to work with locally. In smaller congregations it may not be possible to do all that is suggested here. But even small groups will be able to assemble together and discuss the assigned material for that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By all means, bring your copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book with you to the platform and refer to it. You may feel that certain passages in the book express things so well that you want to read them to the audience. If, for example, you think that the printed introduction to a chapter is very effective, you may read it. However, if you -wish to express the same thought in your own words, that is all right too. You may be talking with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book open in your hands. This does not mean that you will be reading all the material to your audience, but from time to time you may read a short portion. You will not be able to cover every paragraph in detail, so you will have to paraphrase some of them. Maybe just a short sentence or two to cover the point of a paragraph -will be sufficient. But be sure to help the audience to follow you in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The printed suggestions below are directed to the speakers, but they will whet the appetites of everyone and move all to give wholehearted support to this special series of talks.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">Chapter 20: (28 mln.)

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Service Meeting—A Rich Spiritual Meal</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What makes a good service meeting? The same thing that makes a good meal—thorough preparation of nourishing food! Jehovah’s organization provides us with nourishing spiritual food, and by our supplying thorough preparation our service meetings can be a real stimulus to zeal and faith for our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What does thorough preparation mean? It starts with those who have assignments on the meeting. For them it means starting early on the assignment and not waiting until several days before the meeting. It means getting clearly In mind the basic purpose of the part, and then making sure that each point made contributes to this purpose. It means giving careful thought to a setting that is fresh, yet instructive and workable in the congregation territory. A review of Study 23 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers </span><span class="font10">book and the material on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Service Meeting&quot;</span><span class="font10"> In the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lamp&quot;</span><span class="font10"> book will help us to have variety while avoiding showy scenes and overdone props. We also want to give thought to how the material develops the meeting's theme and then make this stand out. If the assignment Is a question-and-answer discussion, then questions that are short and pointed yet thought-provoking should be prepared. There is no need for long introductions or conclusions. It is best to get right into the questions for good results. Further, the questions should encourage the audience to reason “why.” All these suggestions are part of preparing well the nourishing spiritual meal that will be enjoyed by our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Most cooks, when preparing a good meal, would hesitate to serve a new dish to others before trying it ahead of time. So it is good that we try our meeting parts by rehearsing them before giving them to the congregation. We are sure you will agree that rehearsals contribute much to the effectiveness of the service meeting. Are you really doing all you can to rehearse your service meetings for the benefit of all concerned? In view of your circumstances, could you be doing more? If so, it would undoubtedly be a blessing to the congregation. As to when the different parts might be rehearsed, if a group is involved, such as in a demonstration, perhaps it could be before or after the book study and some parts might be checked after the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study on Sunday. The value of such rehearsal and counsel is that the meetings will end on time and will be presented in an instruc</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">tive, coherent manner that will build up our brothers spiritually for the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Food that is properly cooked before being served is tastier and more easily digested. Likewise, if all study in advance the spiritual food to be discussed at the service meeting, we will find it more enjoyable and more easily assimilated into our minds and hearts. It is also true that the passing of food by each one at the table during the meal makes an important contribution to the meal. So each one in the congregation can assume his share of the responsibility for making the meeting lively and beneficial by commenting, relating experiences and taking part in demonstrations when invited. Our preparation for this shows that we are very concerned with giving a pleasing sacrifice of praise to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The dessert of a meal is looked forward to with delight and joy, and brings the meal to a satisfying end. If the overseer’s final expressions are well thought out and prepared, the concluding comments will be looked forward to with great expectation and will bring the meeting to a joyful ending.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> So by each one putting forth a wholehearted effort in preparation, each week our service meeting will be a rich spiritual meal that is instructive, faith-strengthening, and motivating all to a full and joyful share in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Servants to Conduct Ministry School</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It has been helpful and instructive to have the circuit servant conduct the congregation book study for the past year or more, hasn’t it? But that has served its purpose, and he will not do it on his next visit So, how would you like to have the circuit servant handle the Theocratic Ministry School during his next visit to the congregation? The Society is arranging for him to do this. We feel it will be a refreshing change and that the school servant as well as the rest of us will benefit from his good counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What we have arranged is this: Starting with the first week in September and during his next complete round of the circuit the circuit servant will handle the Theocratic Ministry School, instead of having the school servant do so during the week of his visit. On the following visit of the circuit servant the appointed school servant will handle the school. This will give the circuit servant opportunity to observe how he handles his assignment and to offer private counsel and suggestions to the school servant. Then the third time around the circuit the circuit servant will handle the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">the new book are especially for those who want to know the truth, Bible facts, not religious fiction. Show them the chapters that you believe will stimulate the greatest interest. If interest is aroused, by all means try to start a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The fulfillment of Mark 13:10 is an integral part of the “sign” of Christ’s presence and the end of the system of things. Remember, when the “witness” is completed, then “the end” comes. (Matt 24: 14) Are you not personally thankful that you can be fully occupied in showing imperiled mankind the way to security? We know that you are, and we are happy to be working so closely with you in giving the final witness!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Outlook on Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Free home Bible studies are a hallmark of Jehovah’s witnesses the world around. How helpful this work has been in aiding hundreds of thousands of persons to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and to take their stand on Jehovah’s side! But now time is running short for this old system of things and we want to help as many sheepllke ones as we can to learn the truth and act on it while there is still time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> So we have a new approach to use in the Bible-study work. Yes, it is still free of charge. But, as suggested at the “Good News for All Nations” district assemblies this summer, we will seek to help as many people as possible through a six-month Bible-study program. X <sup>3</sup> To accomplish this, endeavor to hold your studies each week. If an unavoidable situation arises and you personally have to miss a study, perhaps another publisher with whom the householder is acquainted can conduct the study that week. Progress is directly related to the regularity of the study. Have in mind helping them learn enough of the truth so that they can act on it within six months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> It would be good to try to study </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a whole chapter of the &quot;Truth” book each week,</span><span class="font10"> though this may not be possible with all householders or with all the chapters in the book. But when you can do it, it will aid the interested one to get a clear picture of the entire subject at one study. To cover some chapters It may take as much as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Servants &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(C ant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">school again, acting as school servant. We hope you will enjoy this adjustment in the schedule and benefit from it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Thursday evening the circuit servant will attend a book study selected by the overseer. The appointed study servant will handle the study, and the circuit servant may give an upbuilding talk to the group for 10 or 15 minutes after the study. The circuit servant will be happy to offer appropriate counsel and suggestions privately to the study servant. Other study servants will conduct their own studies.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">an hour and a half. But if you have the time and the householder does, then we recommend that you complete the chapter. Those who are really Interested will likely be eager to complete the subject. What will make it possible to cover the material at this pace without unwisely rushing? Here are several suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Botli you and the householder will need to study ahead. If some need help in developing good study habits, show them how you prepare for the study and mark your book and urge them to do so too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Also, you will notice that each chapter has a good number of pointed scriptures quoted to establish clearly the points being made. In many cases the scriptures that are quoted will fully satisfy the householder. When it is apparent that the student gets the point and is convinced of the matter, there may be no need to read additional Scriptural proof. However, if the point being studied represents quite a change in viewpoint for the householder or he does not seem to appreciate the full significance of it, take time to read the additional scriptures that are cited. Yon will find all of them well chosen to beat<sup>-</sup> directly on the point being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot; In order to be able to complete a chapter, where practical, within the available time, we also recommend that you focus attention on the points that answer the printed questions and show how the scriptures support them. But do not feel that during your study you need to enlarge on every expression in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> At all times keep before interested ones the importance of beginning to associate with Jehovah’s people at the meetings. If, at the end of six months of intensive study and conscientious efforts to get them to meetings, they are not yet associating with the congregation, then it may be best to use your time to study with someone else who really wants to learn the truth and make progress. Make it your goal to present the good news on Bible studies in such a way that interested ones will act within six months!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">• Is Kingdom Hall construction still in order?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes; as has always been the case, congregations are free to determine for themselves what they will do relative to their Kingdom Hall facilities. If a congregation decides that it should buy property or build a Kingdom Hall, it is entirely in order for this to be done if the congregation can carry such a project to a successful conclusion and wishes to do so. Some correspondence that we have received shows that there are rumors to the effect that the Society is now discouraging Kingdom Hall construction and that congregations should no longer undertake such projects. Such rumors are false, says the President of the Society. Brother Knorr just arranged for the building of several branch offices with Kingdom Halls in them. The Society is glad to see congregations taking steps to provide suitable Kingdom Hall facilities, and the Society is happy to cooperate in any way that it can.</span></p>

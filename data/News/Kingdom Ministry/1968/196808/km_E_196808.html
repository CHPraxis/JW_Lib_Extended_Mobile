<p><span class="font13">Are you as excited as we are about reports heard so far from the district assemblies? The first seveu in the United States drew a combined public-meeting attendance of 103,085, some with huge overflow crowds. To those who have not yet attended, those who have already feasted at the “Good News for All Nations” assemblies say: ‘Don’t miss it. It truly is the best yet I How wonderfully it deals with the needs of Jehovah’s people themselves, preparing them for what lies ahead I’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Here at Bethel we are glad to have Brother Knorr back, after completing his round-the-world trip. At evening meetings in cities where he was caring for the Society's business, he spoke to happy audiences; for example, 26,575 at London, England, 10,344 in Copenhagen, and large crowds in other cities. He was present for the dedication of Belgium’s new branch office in Brussels; and in Switzerland, to the delight of the brothers, he announced forthcoming construction of a new Swiss branch at Thun. Brother Knorr also brought home heart-cheering news of Kingdom expansion in many lands, even amid difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is much to do to keep pace with the forward movement of Jehovah’s organization. We here in the United States will be striving to keep abreast with It, not alone by attending the district assembly, but also by taking hold of another excellent provision for building spirituality. At all congregation book study locations during the week of August 4, we will open the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font13"> at page 401. How timely! In these vital days just prior to Babylon the Great's final fall, we will be learning the why and how of that and other stupendous events, as we take up a verse-by-verse study of Revelation, chapters 14 through 22. We owe it to ourselves and newly interested ones to make regular par-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Let Your Advancement Be Manifest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> One thing that all of us are interested in is seeing Jehovah’s name and kingdom declared in all the earth, isn’t that so? (Rom. 9: 17; Matt. 24:14) What a privilege we have in sharing in Kingdom preaching I And how happy it makes us when we can see that we are making progress in this work, that we are doing a better job of it, and that we are able to do things that formerly seemed out of our reach! Of course, we all know that some persons seem to advance more rapidly than others. But why? There are a variety of factors involved; consider a few of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> One of the main things that contributes to advancement is a humble willingness to be used by Jehovah, to do anything he directs, trusting in him to back one up. Is that the way you feel? Those who do, show real confidence in the fact that “our being adequately qualified issues from God,&quot; and he blesses them richly.—2 Cor. 3: 4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Progress is also stimulated by an earnest desire on our part. It is often easy to keep on doing just what we have been doing and to the extent that we have been doing it. But progress requires an earnest desire and added effort. The apostle Paul urges us to expend ourselves in this way, saying: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.”—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In addition, personal Bible study is necessary if advancement is to become manifest. Invariably those who seem always to be well prepared set aside time each week ticipation in this study a personal goal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Let us, then, unitedly seek to keep abreast with Jehovah’s forward-moving, victorious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">for Bible study; and if they have families, they also study with them. For it is a fact: Spiritual growth and advancement are directly related to one’s study habits.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We also need to share regularly in the field ministry, using the things we have learned. This enables us to grow in ability to speak Jehovah’s praise. If we are irregular, missing entire weeks, each time we share in the ministry it is like starting all over again. It can be discouraging. Those whose advancement is most manifest, the ones who obviously enjoy the field service and have fruitful experiences, are usually out in the field ministry each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Setting goals for ourselves will also help toward advancement. If, for example, you have only been presenting magazines in the ministry, then why not make it your goal to use a Bible sermon, perhaps reading just one scripture? After you have reached this goal, set another one. Resolve to make return visits on persons showing interest, being prepared to offer them further information. Then, make it your goal to conduct a Bible study; and next, if possible, several studies. Establish a good routine of regular service to God that includes these various features of the ministry, and stick to it. (Phil. 3:16) Let your advancement be manifest to all persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Do not forget that Christian assemblies can prove to be milestones in spiritual advancement, and this is definitely true of this summer’s district assemblies. But here, too, some persons benefit more than others do. Those whose advancement is most manifest are the ones who ask themselves: How can I apply what is said to myself and my ministry? So, with full reliance on God to bless our efforts, let's all exert ourselves to let our advancement be manifest, not for our own glory, but that we may be more effective servants of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When we see Jehovah's obvious blessing on something, we rejoice, don’t we? In this regard note what is happening to the regular pioneer service. One year ago for the month of June there were 9,736 regular pioneers. This June the number increased to 11,455, which is a gain of 1,719. What a grand blessing to those taking up this service and to the many to whom they minister. And daily, additional applications are being received. It is also a pleasure to see more sharing in the vacation pioneer service. From September through June of this service year we had a total of 60,504, compared to 55,974 for the same period last year. All of us can rejoice to see Jehovah’s rich blessing on these avenues of service.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>THEY TREASURE THEIR PRIVILEGE OF SERVICE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">H</span><span class="font0">OW blessed we are to have older brothers and sisters among us who have been faithfully serving Jehovah in the fulltime ministry for many, many years! For a moment, think of some older one that you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps you are thinking of an elderly brother who hardly ever misses a meeting at your Kingdom Hall. He comes in with his familiar book bag, greets everyone joyfully, sits down and listens to every word spoken from the platform. At nearly every meeting for field service you notice his gray head in the group. You often see him doing street work or going from house to house. No doubt you have thought to yourself, What a faithful brother!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps you know an elderly pioneer sister who hobbles into the hall with her cane and an ever-smiling face. There she is, always cheerful despite the pain you know that she is suffering due to some affliction of old age. Rain or shine, she is at practically every meeting, including many of those for field service. Probably you have worked with her in the ministry. You cannot help but be impressed by her zeal and determination. Her attitude convinces you that here is a person that deeply treasures working for Jehovah full time! Yes, you may have even thought of joining her in the pioneer service yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Well, brothers, did you know that, among the 933 special pioneers and the 11,455 regular pioneers in the United States, there are thousands of these older persons? Yes, individuals who have been pioneering for twenty, thirty, forty and over forty-five years and who are in their sixties, seventies, eighties and even nineties. While most worldly persons, after sixty-five years of age, are passing away the remaining years of their’ lives in inactivity or idle pursuits, these dear, older brothers of ours are still working with us and with no thought of quitting. They are like the aged servants of God told about in the Bible who kept on serving Jehovah right on till they died. The graying hair, the dimming eyesight, the stiffening muscles, the wrinkling skin and other painful tribulations of old age do not smother their devotion and zealous spirit. No wonder they hold such a special place in our hearts!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fact that these brothers remain in the pioneer work year after year shows that they treasure it very deeply. For instance, an elderly brother in Vanceboro, North Carolina, who had spent thirty-two years in the full-time pioneer activity, said this about it: “The glorious treasure of service has been my very life and I thank Jehovah for such a wonderful privilege.” Though eighty-five years of age, he declared: “I want to assure you that I will continue to serve Jehovah all I can as long as I can.” He did just that until he died this past May. Consider, too, the attitude of a seventy-five-year-old sister in Dallas, Texas, who has been in the pioneer service for thirty-one years now. She wrote: “I do not mean to stop myself. Jehovah will have to stop me in his own way. I mean to go to the end of this work with Jehovah’s help. It is such a sweet life.” What devotion! Old age does not dampen her pioneer spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you were to talk with all these older pioneers you would find that expressions like the ones above could be multiplied thousands of times. Such expressions coupled with their many years of pioneering tell us that there are blessings and joys connected with this privilege that no other work in the world can offer. This is why a ninety-two-year-old pioneer in Marion, Iowa, who has spent forty-four years of his life in the full-time preaching work loves it so much. Yes, and, also why a ninety-four-year-old brother in Oakland, California, is still pioneering after thirty-six years and is exerting himself in such a way that his activity is a wonder to all who know him. Many married couples have found that pioneering is an ideal life for them both. One aged couple in Chase City, Virginia, are still at it after thirty-seven years. The husband is ninety-one and the wife is seventy-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are an inspiration to the congregation to which they belong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What are the blessings and joys that these older ones have had in the pioneer service? Since they are in the best position to know, let us listen to their answers. Hearing their experiences will give us some feel of the fulltime work. This may move us to make the full-time pioneer service our life’s work and enable us to enjoy the best years of our lives this side of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Best Years of Their Lives</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among these thousands of aged, active fulltime workers, you will find fathers, mothers, married couples and single persons. If you asked any of them what were the best years of their lives, they would all answer, “My years in the pioneer service.” One sister who is pioneering with her husband in Washington, D.C., said this about her sixteen years of pioneering: “I do not know how to tell you how much I enjoyed every year. Blessing on top of blessing. The best work I have ever done in my whole sixty-six years.” Another pioneer who is eighty-three years old wrote: “The past nineteen years have been the most joyful of my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the most satisfying joys of pioneering is to see Jehovah’s blessing upon your work. What happiness there is in aiding another person to become a praiser of God like yourself! Imagine how you would feel knowing that your labors helped establish a congregation in an area that had none!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Well, here is what the seventy-five-year-old pioneer in Dallas, Texas, that we quoted before said about this: “I started pioneering May 1, 1937, after leaving many material possessions and a high-paying position. I took up the highest paying work there is, the pioneer service. After looking back I have no feeling of loss at all but a feeling of great gain. I was sent to a territory where there was no congregation at the time. After many years of hard work, today there are four thriving congregations, and what a joy to know that many of the persons in all four of them I personally assisted. Many are in foreign fields, others are serving where the need is greater. So I can truly say that Jehovah has blessed the fruits of my labors and my joys have been many. I even had four of the ones I assisted join me as vacation pioneers in April 1967.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another aged Witness who lives in Manhattan, New York city, has spent thirty-three happy years pioneering. Ten of these were spent as a special pioneer, which requires more time and effort. How does she feel about all this? Here is her answer: “If I had my life to live over again I would want to do as I have been doing. Ten of the happiest years were spent in the special pioneer work, and when I hear of Kingdom Halls being built in our former isolated territory, it makes me very happy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An eighty-three-year-old full-time worker in Poughkeepsie, New York, looking back over twenty years of pioneering, said: “I can remember when the congregation numbered only twelve persons and the witness work flickered like a small candlelight in a very dark community. In the course of time the seeds of truth were sown and, after many years of service and Jehovah’s blessings, I can now view a blossoming spiritual garden with the joy of knowing I have had a share in cultivating the hearts of some now praising Jehovah. Presently there are two units in Poughkeepsie and two others are nearby. To watch the new sheep come into the Kingdom Hall and see the changes they make in their life to conform to Bible standards imbues in a person, despite one’s age, zeal to keep on looking for more sheeplike ones so that one can teach them Jehovah’s ways.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A pioneer in Los Angeles, California, is . seventy-three years of age and has had many blessings during the twenty-eight best years of her life. She reports about one of them: “It certainly was a joy to see three persons with whom Jehovah had used me to study his Word take their stand at the Cleveland, Ohio, convention in 1946. One of these sisters is still pioneering, and that brings joy to my heart also.” What a blessing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Brothers, were you aware of the fact that some of these older pioneers had families when they began to pioneer? In fact, the pioneer sister quoted in the previous paragraph was a mother with family responsibilities when she took up pioneering. Just look at what blessings she received from following this faithful course. “Two of my children have served as pioneers in the past. My sonin-law is an assistant congregation servant in Atlanta, Georgia, and his son is an overseer in Los Angeles. I also have two great-grandsons in the truth, one of whom is an assistant congregation servant in Atlanta, Georgia. My work has not been in vain, for Jehovah has blessed me to see my children and their children in the grand preaching work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consider the case of this seventy-four-year-old pioneer sister: When she began pioneering back in the forties she had children, and her husband was not in the truth. Jehovah blessed her patience, hard work and faith through the years. Before her husband closed his eyes in death, she had the joy of having seen him finally join the family in doing Jehovah’s will. All her children whom she raised in the truth followed her example by sharing in the full-time work. One daughter graduated from Gilead, served for many years in the Dominican Republic and Cuba and is now working with her husband who is in the circuit work. Her other children all served at Bethel; in fact, three of them are still there with their marriage mates. Yes, this dear sister has had the joy of seeing her offspring in the circuit work, zone work and even teach at Gilead for a number of years. With a treasure like this, her years in the pioneer work, setting a fine example for her family, are indeed the best years of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When that aged couple in Chase City, Virginia, went out to serve as pioneers thirtyseven years ago, they too had a family of children. They traveled with them and preached in many places in the South where there were no Witnesses. Besides helping many to find the truth of the Bible, they aided their children to grow up to appreciate the service of God. Today one son is serving in the Society’s branch office in Colombia, South America. Two others are praising Jehovah in the circuit work. The sacrifices that these parents made for their children’s spiritual welfare have paid off in dividends. Setting their feet on the road of full-time service has brought them unimagined blessings and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These pioneers had many other blessings that made their years of full-time preaching the best years of their lives—personal blessings that would fill pages. All of them tell how pioneering helped to strengthen their faith in Jehovah God, teaching them to rely fully on him for the necessities of life. This has given them a sense of security and an inner feeling of contentment. Furthermore, their knowledge has increased, thus strengthening them to carry on and making their hope “sure and firm.” (Heb. 6:19) Many of them speak of how their health improved due to the good exercise of both mind and body in the full-time preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, brothers, we do not want you to get the impression that pioneering is all smooth sailing. Remember, Satan is out to discourage the praising of Jehovah and he will try to hinder anyone who wants to do this, especially those who plan to do it full time. One ol(i pioneer said, “Satan never overlooked anything in his efforts to stop us.” Human imperfection too presents problems. How, then, did our dear older brothers overcome such difficulties and obstacles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Overcoming the Obstacles</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to Keep Their Treasured Privilege</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When these long-time pioneers began their full-time work, they were determine</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">d r</span><span class="font0">ight from the start to stick with it and not quit when difficulties arose. They knew that Satan would do everything to try to stop them. So they made up their minds to resist him and pioneer as long as they were physically able. One couple said, “When we entered the pioneer work [forty years ago], we fully made up our minds to stay in Jehovah’s service forever, dedicating our full-time service.” Also these pioneers knew that Jehovah would help them keep their treasured privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Consider the fine attitude of this seventyseven-year-old sister: “Although my lack of material means, my lack of transportation and many other trying situations made it difficult to stay on the pioneer list, I never considered leaving my grand privilege of fulltime pioneering. It is the joy that I had in serving the Lord that really helped me overcome many of these tests and trials.” Yes, this dear sister who never considered quitting the pioneer service has been helped by God to stay in it for thirty-one years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Listen to how this eighty-seven-year-old brother who has been pioneering for forty years overcame his problems. “When any problems arose, I always left them with Jehovah to settle. There have been times when I postponed meals but never have I had to go without one. This is Jehovah’s work and he will provide the necessary things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Think of the faith of an anointed couple who, after forty years, are still praising Jehovah in the full-time preaching work. They write: “We went into the pioneer work at what would seem to have been an unfavorable time, for this was the beginning of the depression years. People then did not have money to take the literature so we took produce and other things for it, such as chickens, ducks, geese, wild game, vegetables, nuts, canned goods, canned meat and cured sausage. We never missed a meal during the entire time. We would just have to change our diet pretty often. Jehovah blessed us in working out real problems in the pioneer work all the way through. Yes, we had plenty of trials but there is always a way out, as shown at 2 Corinthians 4:8-14. Satan tried to stop us through our flesh. I was operated on five times and the old body is about played out. We do the best we can and have the same mind in serving Jehovah now as when we started. We can say that Jehovah has kept his word and that he can keep his servants under all conditions that may arise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One sister reports that she had thirteen major operations, ten of which were for can' cer, during her twenty years of pioneering. Evidently, she had strength to endure these tribulations by virtue of God who imparted power to her. (Phil. 4:13) Today it is even more difficult for these older pioneers to carry on. Their health is not what it once was, because of old age, but they still preach. - Picture in your mind the ninety-three-year-old sister who did not let snow on the ground stop her. With her book bag and cane in one hand and a bag of salt to pave the way in the other, she went out to witness to her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Think of the aged couple in Shiner, Texas, who have been pioneering for over forty years. Both are of the anointed and, despite their age, they are special pioneers today. He is also caring for some of the responsibilities of oversight in the little congregation to which they are assigned. Truly, they treasure their privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Now Is the Time to Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How fine it is to have such encouraging examples of faithful endurance among us! Of course, many of these older folks learned the truth when they already had families and other obligations, but they worked toward the goal of pioneer service, enrolled and now have stayed with it for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, many of you young folks are in an even more favorable position. You have the truth now, in your youth, and your freedom from heavy family responsibilities in most cases makes it easier to take up pioneer service. Why wait to enter this fulltime service? Really, now is the time to start. Take into consideration the shortness of the time until Jehovah will destroy this wicked system of things, and act wisely. “Brothers, the time left is reduced,” yes, reduced now to a very short period.—1 Cor. 7:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you have been thinking about pioneering, then take advantage of the opportunity you may have now. Do not keep putting it off. You young folks, as soon as you leave school, why not go into this rewarding work? If you are still in school, with only a year or two more to go, why not vacation pioneer at every opportunity and plan to enroll as a full-time pioneer as soon as you complete your schooling? Set this as your goal. If you are free now, then this is the time to reach out for the privileges of pioneering, special pioneering, missionary work or Bethel service. Pursuing such a course is the best way to prepare for life in God’s new order. Do not let the desire for an automobile or a larger bank account come ahead of this joyful work. Seek first the Kingdom. Jehovah will richly bless your efforts if you have complete faith in him and are willing and determined to stick to the work, as have those faithful brothers and sisters who have truly made Jehovah’s service their career.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Searching for the &quot;Sheep&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When sheep are lost, a diligent shepherd searches into the most inaccessible places to find them and lead them into the fold. These valuable creatures belong to his master and none should be left unfound or uncared for. (Ezek. 34:11) Jehovah’s people feel that way about his “sheep,” and yearly in July, August and September we search in isolated territory for sheeplike ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Has your congregation been assigned the joyful privilege of hunting for “sheep” in isolated territories? How are you conducting the search? From some congregations groups of publishers, including vacation and regular pioneers, will go and stay in the territory for a week or more. We know of family groups who have spent vacations in such territory and have reported it was the “best vacation ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some are able to share in the search only on the weekends. Car groups leave home on Friday evening and stay at a motel or in a travel trailer, or arrange in advance to stay with people friendly to the work. On Saturday and Sunday they arrange to cover the more populated areas first and then branch off to the country roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> A number of special pioneers have volunteered to go to especially remote areas. This year 115 are combing through 106 unassigned territories. They, like their fellow searchers in other isolated areas, are offering a year’s subscription to either magazine and a regularsize bound book on a contribution of $1.50. In this way the magazines will be coming to these thirsty</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">♦ In each congregation an actual count of literature should be taken early in September. We are sending out two Literature Inventory forms with the monthly statement. We would appreciate your filling them out and returning the original to us no later than September 5. You may keep the duplicate in your file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ For the next service year a supply of monthly report cards and magazine Distributors* Order blanks is being sent out to each congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ August and September: Offer the latest bound book. You may offer the Life </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting</span><span class="font12"> book and a booklet for 50c or this book and the 'Impossible to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lie’</span><span class="font12"> book with two booklets for $1. You may also combine the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book with either for 75c. October: Offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> with three booklets, for 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ If you will be away from home during August, vacationing or at an assembly, don’t forget to send your field service reports to the overseer or assistant congregation servant so that your activity can be counted. </span><span class="font13">sheeplike ones with waters of truth even if it is not possible to visit them regularly in the months ahead. Studies may be conducted through correspondence. Even those of you left at home because of infirmities can have a share in this. The names and addresses of interested ones can be given to you and you can write them, arranging to conduct a study where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup> Hardworking shepherds must eat. For your own spiritual feeding arrange for a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study so that the ones in the territory all week or only on the weekends will not miss out, though not at the home congregation meeting. Public meetings, too, can be arranged and all met in the field invited to attend. These can be held in public parks, on the lawns or in the homes of interested ones or In rented places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The search goes on in other areas too. Some of you in congregations that cover your territory often have generously offered to assist other congregations with much territory and few publishers to work in it. Also, rural areas that are impassable or difficult to reach in winter months can be covered under better weather and road conditions. To save time, carry picnic lunches and eat them in a pleasant spot and, where possible in scattered rural territory, have only two or three travel in one car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ What a privilege it is for us to search for Jehovah’s “sheep” in isolated and rural territory! Surely Jehovah’s blessing and great joy will come to those giving of themselves so willingly in this most rewarding work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Have you told those with whom you conduct studies about the special series of public talks during September and October? If not, do it now. Urge them to be present for each of these talks. Better yet, arrange to bring them with you. These talks are designed, not only to deepen our appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions, but also to help them to see the difference between true religion and the false and to realize the importance of taking a firm stand on Jehovah’s side while there is yet the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ At your next circuit assembly it would be advisable for the circuit and district servants, during the meeting with congregation servants, to discuss ways in which territory that needs attention can be made available to publishers in other congregations who can work it. Congregation servants should come, with the magazine-territory servants prepared for the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Detailed printed instructions concerning the contents of the special talks for September and October will be sent to congregations with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Strengthening Family Ties</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’As the years go by, parents see their children growing up and leaving home. Often they wish they had spent more time with their children and done more things together while they had the opportunity. If you have a growing family, perhaps this month is one when you can especially plan and do things together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Ecclesiastes 3:1 tells us: “For everything there is an appointed time.” So it is good to talk things Over with your family and have a schedule for study, for service, for meetings, to do things that are necessary around the house and even to make special trips or go on outings together. We know you parents have to compete with the old system for the attention and affection of your children, and the summer months are a good time to strengthen the bonds of family unity and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> liemember especially the counsel at Deuteronomy 6:6-9 and work out a regular program of family study. Start wltl) a prepared discussion of the text each day and read experiences from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font13">or other selected material. Have a definite time each week that you get together and study as a family. Conduct these sessions in such a way that the children can share in them, perhaps even acting out scenes from the Bible where this is possible. These should be part of the happy times that a family spends together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> For recreation and education combined, the Gilead students have taken some interesting tours: to the zoo, museums, the aquarium and the planetarium. You may wish to plan similar outings that the whole family would enjoy. Note how beneficial they can be, as shown by the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> article of March 8, 1968, “Getting to Know God.” Let this month be a memorable month with your family, one long remembered and bringing blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Up Our Advantage</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In May yon brothers placed 793,317 books. That was 270,529 more than our previous peak month away back in January 1940. Most of those were </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> books. Never has any book published by the Society been placed so readily. Its material appeals to all kinds of people. The Society’s factories in Brooklyn and Germany have had to run overtime to meet the requests for more copies. The way has been opened up to talk to thousands of people that we were not able to reach before. What can we do to follow up this advantage? Can a study be started in the book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Your immediate reaction may be, ‘This subject of evolution is too much for me: I wouldn't want to try studying that with a householder.' But the book is not all on evolution. Why not prepare to discuss with the householder one of the other timely topics that are considered therein? Many persons would like to have answered the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Feature the Ones That Are Easy to Place</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup>A11 of us have found that certain issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> can be placed more easily than others. When you are featuring an article that discusses what really concerns the public, barriers of indifference and prejudice seem to disappear, and your supply of magazines is placed in a short time. That happened to many publisher's last January when we offered the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazine that discussed “The Increase of Lawlessness.” Perhaps you found that it also happened during July when you were presenting the magazine that focused attention on “Finding an Answer to the Problem of Race,”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> After offering one of these issues that was particularly placeable in your territory, have you wished that you could go on offering it for several months until you had worked your entire territory? Why not do it? It is true that your distributor’s supply of the next issue will be arriving in a short time, but you may find that the new ones are easier to place if you continue to feature the one that you particularly like, and include the new one question discussed in Chapter 12, “Who or What Was Responsible for Man’s Wickedness?” Why not study this with them? Encourage them to read and prepare a chapter at a time for discussion if you wish. Perhaps you would prefer to start with Chapter 13, “Why Has Wickedness Been Permitted for So Long?” Some brothers have had good success in discussing the material on the happenings marking the sign of the “last days” as set out in Chapter 14, “How Much Longer Will It Be?” Some may even decide to study the material on evolution, especially if the interested person is a student or teacher. If so, then the study can be conducted on this material. It is true that it will be necessary to prepare questions that you can use to discuss the chapters with them, but it should not be difficult to formulate these as you prepare for the study yourself. &quot;</span></p></li>

Then he reached into his case and pulled out some issues that were several months old but that had been easy to place; the reaction of people at the doors began to change right away. Why don’t you try it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If you would like to have an additional supply of any particular issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font13">tell your magazine-territory servant how many you want, and they will be ordered for you. If the order is sent to the Society at any time </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">within a month after the date of issue,</span><span class="font13"> we will be glad to print as many additional copies as may be needed to fill the requests. Then you can continue to use them for three, four or more months, until you have worked your entire territory or run out of the magazines. If.this results in more placements, it will also mean a greater witness, and that is what interests all of us, isn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>

It could be worked into the talk in some fashion similar to the method suggested for the current public meetings. For example, in handling Study 45 he could have another brother demonstrate what should be done when a person refuses the literature at the door. On another week the speaker might wish to Include one or two questions to the audience to deal with the ‘•problem.&quot; Other aids, such as a blackboard or a map, could be used. These suggestions can be applied in a practical way so the “problem&quot; is handled and the audience gets the most benefit from the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Prior to being assigned public talks a speaker will likely have been giving instruction talks. The manner in which he gives the talk and handles the &quot;problems&quot; will allow for seeing whether he could handle public talks or not and, in fact, will prepare him for giving such talks. As the &quot;Lamp” book says, the instruction talk should be assigned to &quot;one of the better qualified brothers.&quot; He should be one who has proved his ability to give informative, well prepared talks over a period of time. He should not be a novice or an undedicated person. Basically he should have qualities similar to those you look for in a public speaker, though he may not yet have reached the level expected of one who can be assigned to deliver public talks.</span></p>

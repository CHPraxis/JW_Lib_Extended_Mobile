<p><span class="font9">If you received orders for a million </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> books in one month, you would probably be excited. That is what happened to us here in May. In fact, the orders totaled 1,066,952. We had been anticipating a very successful month of service in May and so more than 360,000 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> books were made during April. But May exceeded our expectations. In addition to regular orders received, there were 675 longdistance telephone calls and 225 telegrams. Many asked that books be sent by the fastest means, so we had two trucks a day go to New York's airports. When one of the brothers was turning over a shipment, an airline clerk asked, “Is this more of those blue books?” The brother said, “You mean the one on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolutionf”</span><span class="font9"> The clerk said, “Yes, that’s It. Do you have any extra in the truck? I saw one at my son’s home and would like to read it.” The brother did not have any extra ones but arranged to mail two copies to the airline clerk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From all sides brothers reported their excellent experiences. One publisher in California received fifty </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> books one day and by the next day they were all gone. He had permission to distribute books on a university campus. Many teachers have showed interest One college asked about obtaining 400 as textbooks for the biology department. In 2 1/2 hours on a New York street a brother was able to place 26 books. Even those who did not take the book were friendly. A brother from Texas, in sending in his order, summed it up very well, “They simply place themselves!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The factory ran extra time trying to keep up with the orders and almost succeeded, but not quite. Total production of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> books for April and May was 994,215.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In July we will be using </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> again in combination with other publications, and we hope to keep everyone supplied. Have you considered approaching businessmen?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing in the Victory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Is it possible for us to share today in a victory procession for Jehovah just as his ancient people did? (Ps. 68 : 24-28) In ancient Israel each victory of Jehovah God became the reason for a victory procession on the part of his chosen people, who would march to his sanctuary or central place of worship and there rejoice in what had happened. Today we can do this too, and one way is by bearing witness to Jehovah’s name and Kingdom both publicly and from house to house as the apostles did. —Acts 5:42; 20: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In some places, however, it is becoming more challenging to get a listening ear. To overcome this problem, some of the brothers have modified their approach. Their introduction goes something like this: “Good afternoon. Possibly you are busy, but may I take a few moments to get your opinion on something that vitally affects all of us in this neighborhood? ‘Why is there so much delinquency and vandalism in our area?’ I’d appreciate your thoughts on this.” Usually the householder will give his opinion on such a question because it is specific and affects him. Then, depending on his reaction, we can adapt our comments appropriately. Naturally, we would want to use an approach consistent with the householder’s circumstances and environment. Being Many are faced with problems, including shoplifting, robbery and employee dishonesty. It will help them to know why wickedness has been permitted. So why not try offering the combination to business people as well as from house to house. If you run out of one book, then offer another. Surely you will have many happy experiences during the summer campaign.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Rejoicing in Jehovah’s victory, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font9">flexible and adaptable as well as conversational helps put the householder at ease, makes for a more pleasant atmosphere and generally gets better results. And best of all, it helps us to share effectively in the victory procession, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Another way to share in the victory procession is to be present at our circuit, district, national and international assemblies. Many of us will be attending the “Good News for All Nations” District Assembly this month, and how we are looking forward to Jehovah’s blessings on that occasion! And, of course, all of us earnestly desire to be in that victory procession of favored survivors following the war of Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Further, when it comes to sharing in the victory procession by means of the house-to-house ministry, did you know that hundreds of congregations are working together to get all congregation territory covered this summer? Just think what a procession of praise to Jehovah It is as well-organized car groups cover the territory systematically and thereafter turn over the interest to the local congregation for further cultivation. We commend all of you who will be having a share in this work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It could be, too, that you will have the privilege of witnessing to those in unassigned territory. In this case, since you likely will not be able to return and see these interested ones for a full year, you could use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> or the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> subscription so they will have something coming to them regularly throughout the year. You may want to offer a year's subscription for one of the magazines with one of the latest bound books, possibly the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font9"> book, on a contribution of $1.50. In this case, you could give four booklets as a</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Answering the Call to Serve. (Isa. 6:8) Song 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Introduction, text and comments. Work in experience from &quot;1968 Yearbook,” page 113, par. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">16 min: Stirring talk on 1968 Assemblies. Please see &quot;Watchtower” Issues of February 15, 1968, page 127, and May 1, 1968, pages 280 and 281, for source material. Enthusiastically encourage attendance. Help brothers to see how local problems standing in their way can be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: &quot;A Special Program.&quot; Questions and answers. Work diligently to aid all with whom you conduct studies to attend this entire series of talks. 16 min: Consideration of suggested sermon for July through September. During the months of July through September we will be offering, in various combinations, the “Life Everlasting,” &quot;Impossible to Lie&quot; and &quot;Evolution” books. The sermon we use with this fine selection of publications deserves thoughtful preparation so the offer will be readily accepted by the people in our territory. If you want to use the presentation from June or some previous sermon, that will be fine. However, if you would like to try something new, you will enjoy the following sermon: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Peace at Last!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer. 8:9—Why man's efforts to achieve peace a failure</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mic. 4:3—Jehovah causes honest-hearted persons of all nations to become peaceful even now</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many have found it very easy to get into a good conversation with householders in some territories by asking a question like this: “Do you think the efforts of religious organizations will bring a more peaceful world?” In other territories we might ask if they feel world leaders have any solution that will calm the world's present turmoil. Or, we might mention the comments of the President of the United States earlier this year to the effect that he had consulted the wisest men he knows and cannot figure out what else to do. (New York &quot;Times,&quot; 2/16/68, p. 18, col. 1) So, where does one turn for direction and hope? we might inquire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To help you in making the transition to the offer, you may want to use the Information in the &quot;Life Everlasting” book, page 5, par. 1: page 398, par. 36, or appropriate excerpts from the “Evolution'<sup>1</sup> book, pages 172-176.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Discuss the above material with the audience, drawing them out as to why a particular statement or approach would be effective in your local territory, and then have the sermon demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2 min: Accounts report for June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Consider “How Did We Do in May?” and local service report. Song 103.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Hear and Do Jehovah’s Will. (Jas. 1:25) Song 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Discussion with audience of recent items from &quot;Questions from Readers&quot; in “The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Question Box. Animated discussion between two family heads bringing out main points of article. 15 min: &quot;Sharing in the Victory.” Lively questlon-and-answer coverage, and demonstration of appropriate points from paragraphs 2 and 5. 5 min: Experiences regarding how different ones overcame problems so they could attend an assembly this summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Be sure to encourage brothers to bring “Lamp” books next week and to study material on pages 95-97. Also, might incorporate comments about slogan on page 4. Song 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Showing Love for Others. (1 Cor. 13:4) Song 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Introduction, text, comments, Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Branch Letter. Suggested way to handle: Have overseer and book study servant use information to encourage a weak brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: When Should Meetings End?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Chairman: Meetings should end on time. If they do not, various difficulties arise (“Qualified,” p. 95, par. 9), and we are deprived of needed association after the meetings. (Ps. 133:1, 2; 1 Thess. 5:11) “Lamp” book states that the &quot;Watchtower study is just one hour in length, with no more than 10 additional minutes for opening and closing, including announcements. If ministry school begins, for example, with song and prayer at 7:25 p.m., then service meeting should conclude by 9:35 p.m. This includes closing song and prayer. The book study is described as a “one-hour group study,” and should be kept to that. This includes opening and closing reviews. Meetings should start at announced time. When meetings run overtime enthusiasm wanes and there is a loss of benefits, as the following demonstrations will show. Of course, if the overseer has some extra comments or something that should be said to the congregation, then he can adjust the program so it will still end on time. After each of the following demonstrations chairman can make brief observation and introduce next part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Sister Dilemma notices meeting running overtime and begins thinking of unbelieving husband waiting for her. “How upset is he going to be? Should I leave before meeting ends? Will the brothers understand if I do?” Anxious thoughts crowd out the fine information being presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Sister Ida Helped notices someone who has not been at meetings for some time. “Oh, there’s Mabel; she’s been having lots of problems lately and needs encouragement. I know she has to leave in time to get her children to bed early. Even mine are getting restless now. I’d like to talk to her, but there is no time! I do wish the meetings ended on time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Brother Ben Rushed observes Brother Downhearted, thinks, “I'd like to encourage him for a few minutes, but now there won’t be time since the program is running late and I have to obtain my service supplies before the counters close.” Scene shifts to brother who has next part on meeting and he’s thinking to himself: &quot;He’s running overtime! I’m supposed to be finished by ten after. I can’t change our demonstration, so I’ll just have to shorten my comments, but this means leaving out important information.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Chairman: What can we do to keep meetings on time? Those assigned should rehearse, giving particular attention to timing, especially when demonstrations are involved. Make note of time the next brother should be on platform and see that he is. Not proper to steal time from others. (Luke 6:31) Next brother should not have to cut his part short because someone inconsiderately ran overtime. Congregation can help by being on time and responding quickly during audience participation. Since meetings are part of victory procession, we should make every effort to keep them orderly and on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Developing Heart Appreciation in Our Students. Audience discussion of “Lamp” book, pages 95-97. Utilize 8-10 minutes demonstrating appropriate points with a view to developing the “quality&quot; of our studies as well as incorporating Godlike qualities into their personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate announcements. Song 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Keeping Abreast with Jehovah’s Organization. (Heb. 13:20, 21) Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Talk on theme for August, &quot;Keeping Abreast with Jehovah’s Organization.” (See “Watchtower” of August 1.) Also, work in text and comments for day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: &quot;Moving?” Questions and answers and demonstration from viewpoint of one who is &quot;found” in field after a year away from organization. Former publisher expresses wish that someone had put him in touch with new congregation at an early date. Study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Talk on “Value of Prayer.” Might work in some experiences from “1968 Yearbook,” p. 104, par. 1; p. 148, par. 3; p. 240, par. 3; p. 279, par. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Presenting the Good News. Questlon-and-answer coverage with appropriate demonstrations. Please work in application of some of the scriptures in the third paragraph. Chairman should highlight the blessings of house-to-house work, especially over the weekend when there are good opportunities for training publishers. Also check June 1967 &quot;Kingdom Ministry,” Question Box material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 43.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a share we all had in the victory procession during May! While the total production of &quot;Evolution” books was 994,215, there were 793,317 books actually placed during May. It is the highest figure yet for any one month and far exceeds the previous peak of 522,788 set back In 1940. Well done, brothers! We really did well with regard to Bible studies too—296,856. This is the next best figure to our all-time peak of studies, 308,118 in April. And there were 331,359 publishers in the field during May, a 6.4-percent increase over last year's average. What a fine report!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A Special Program</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">A special program of public meetings has been planned for all English-speaking congregations in the United States for September and October. Further details will be provided at the district assemblies, but the titles of the talks are being listed here so that you can order your handbills now. Be sure to do it soon! .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each talk should be scheduled for the date shown, so all congregations will have the same program (with the exception of those few congregations that already have printed handbills for other subjects for those dates).

Circuit servants, on the other hand, will give the public talk listed for the week, according to the schedule shown below. They will do this in all congregations that they .serve during these two months only. If your congregation already has handbills for other talks for these dates, then you will hear the special talks at a later time. The special public talk titles are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sept. 1: The Blessings from Knowing God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sept. 8: Where Are the Dead?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What do we do when someone associated with our congregation suddenly stops coming to meetings? Why, we call on him right away and build him up, don’t we? We may even study with him for a time. But when a person moves away and then stops associating, how will anyone know that this person is in need of assistance? Those who move may be contacted the first time the territory in which they live is worked, but sometimes they are not. When those moving are newly interested or in need of spiritual encouragement, we want to help them quickly to get established in the new congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">• Since the saving of seats at assemblies presents a problem, does the Society have any comment regarding this matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society endeavors to estimate closely the expected attendance at a particular assembly city so the facilities will not be overcrowded. This accounts for making recommendations occasionally as to where it will be best for publishers in certain circuits to attend, such as in the April &quot;Kingdom Ministry.&quot; However, there are so many factors involved that the unexpected does occur at times, and this may cause a crowded condition. Yet, we all like to have seats, and it is desirable that members of a family sit together. It is understandable, too, that friends enjoy being together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is a suggestion that we recommend for all assemblies: Make it a point to arrive at least fifteen or twenty minutes before the program is to start and to be seated five minutes before. If you are saving a seat for sojneone and the one you expect has not arrived by the time the program begins, it would be the considerate thing to relinquish the reserved seat if others are waiting to be seated. The one who is late would then need to find a seat among those vacant for that session. Blocks of seats should not be held in reserve by keeping apparel, songbooks and magazines on them. The seats are free and the Society is happy to have all who will to come and learn from what they hear and see at the assemblies, but it is only reasonable that those who are present and ready to be seated should use the seats that are vacant. It is understood, of course, that it is necessary at times for those who have already claimed their seats to leave them for a few minutes, either to visit the rest room or for some emergency situation. Seats may also be saved for volunteer workers at the assembly, since they may be detained a few minutes in taking care of our needs. Attendants will make allowance for these situations, but they will show consideration for those standing and arrange for them to make use of unoccupied seats. Let us show in this practical way that we love our brothers as ourselves, and so add to the spirit and enjoyment of the assembly by all who attend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On Sunday</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The other day two brothers here at Bethel were discussing the house-to-house work. One of the brothers remarked: “I was talking to an Older brother in my congregation recently and he made a rather interesting observation on his ministerial service. He has a Bible study with his family, takes advantage of incidental witnessing, makes several back-calls each week, and his hours are good. But upon further examination he realized that his house-to-house work was suffering. As he put it: ‘It’s been a long time since I’ve really shared in that feature of the ministry.’ ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Could more of us be experiencing this same problem? It is true that we are all very busy, but since this present system has so little time left, could we arrange our affairs to share In the house-to-house work more fully, especially on weekends when more of us have the opportunity to do so, and thus search out the deserving ones?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you were asked to enumerate some of the benefits we gain from the house-to-house work, how many could you identify? Here are just a few: This work strengthens us and perfects our faith. It helps us to overcome timidity and hesitancy in the ministry. (1 John 4:18) We learn how to use the “sword of the spirit” more effectively. (Heb. 4: 12) Additionally, it keeps our back-call and Bible study ministry from getting stagnant, as we are always finding fresh and stimulating calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Sharing In the Victory </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font9">premium with the offer. We have had some wonderful reports from publishers who arranged to spend full weekends out in the territory, staying overnight in a motel, or some other accommodation, and thereby enjoying a full Saturday and Sunday In the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> What a wonderful God we serve 1 Without a doubt, as we all reflect the progressive spirit manifested by Jehovah’s organization, we will be motivated to help others see that it is important to learn the truth and eventually join the victory procession of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Further, this work requires courage, and because of this we feel Jehovah by our side as we engage in it, perhaps more so than in any other avenue of service. (Acts 18:9, 10) And how vital it is for people to hear the good news at this time In man’s history,—Horn. 10:14, 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> But what has happened to the victory procession on Sunday In some areas? Circuit and district servants from different parts of the country indicate that this work is not supported the way it should be, and this is often true where morning meetings are held. Surely, it could not be lack of incentive after enjoying several hours of fine encouragement and spiritual uplift. Further, in many areas, the afternoon period has proved to be an ideal time to talk to interested ones, for they are in a more relaxed frame of mind and better able to receive visitors. So what causes this problem on Sunday? In many cases it appears to be lack of leadership by the servants and lack of planning. To remedy this, our brothers are doing certain things. Some, for example, are adjusting their eating habits on Sunday, bringing sandwiches, which are eaten at the Kingdom Hall or at some other convenient location, so they can get a good start in the field ministry right after the morning meetings. Then, after enjoying several hours in the ministry, they eat their big meal later in the day. Others, especially book study servants and family heads, have found that it is best to make arrangements early in the week, perhaps after the book study, to work with certain ones on Sunday. In this way good training and encouragement are mutually enjoyed. Further, some servants are personally talking to those who need encouragement to share In this vital service, perhaps because of timidity or lack of training. One more thought: If possible, why not schedule your studies later on in the day so you can enjoy house-to-house work also?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If we arrange our affairs to share in the house-to-house work as often and as fully as possible, think of the added praise that will come to Jehovah’s name as we share in the victory procession to his praise.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">does not know the name and address of the overseer of the congregation in whose territory they will be living, he can always write the Society and obtain this information. Then he can write ahead to the new overseer, letting him know the approximate date of arrival and something about the family or individual making the move so arrangements can be made for a warm welcome. Promptly visiting and welcoming the newcomers will be most encouraging to them. Assistance can be offered as necessary. For example, if they are in need of help or a Bible study, this can be arranged in addition to helping them get to meetings. Not wanting any to lose their place in the victory procession will make us alert to show loving concern for those who move.</span></p>

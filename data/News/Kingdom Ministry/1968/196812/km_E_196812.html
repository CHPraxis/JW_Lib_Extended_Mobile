<p><span class="font1">DECEMBER 1961 “Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.’'—Maric 13:10. VOL XI NO. 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It won’t be long now until you receive your copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1969 Yearbook.</span><span class="font9"> It’s on the presses in the factory, and should be ready to ship out by the end of November. What a thrilling report it contains! We’re not going to give you the details here; you will want to read them for yourself in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font9"> Be sure to read it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the breakfast table the other day Brother Knorr told us that he was leaving for Europe for a short time to care for plans in connection with the conventions to be held there next summer and some branchexpansion problems. Are you planning to attend those assemblies? If you told the Society that you wanted to be included in the travel arrangements being made, have you followed through by sending in your reservation request? Don’t wait until it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">My, what a busy time we are having here at Bethel these days! By inid-November well over 5,500,000 bound books had been printed, bound and shipped out from the factory. All this in Just two and a half months! The serious conditions in the world have touched millions of persons, and many are now more willing to listen to the Kingdom message and read the literature. And we are glad to see it, aren’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">East month we told you that all-time records were being reached in production of the special magazines. Well, our production of the October 8 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> both English and foreign, here in Brooklyn has soared up to 8,492,100 copies. And the October 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> English and foreign, totaled 5,185,800. Just think of it! And what about the other branches that do printing? Between Canada and England, the printing of the October 8 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> was 2,175,-000 copies; the special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font9">1,285,000. Beports have also come in from Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland telling that they have printed a combined total of 2,260,270 copies of the October 8 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> and 989,000 of the October 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> Most foreign-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">God Makes It Grow'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Another New Peak in Publishers!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What a thrill it was to see the new service year start off with an all-time peak in publishers during September I But, brothers, it did not stop there. The second month of the service year was marked by a second all-time peak I The report just compiled shows that there were 342,472 publishers out in the field ministry during October, and that is 7,024 over the September peak. Why, that means that over 225 new praisers of Jehovah started out in the field service here in the United States every day during October. Just think of it!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In all respects the report for the month shows that you feel the urgency of the times and of the work that is being done. Average hours moved up to 10.8 per publisher. Magazine placements totaled 7,599,834. Subscriptions obtained were 30,933 over last October—a total of 211,706; in addition, 432,876 books were placed. Fine follow-up work was being done, as shown by the new peak of 2,732,109 back-calls and other new peak—313,394 home Bible language editions had the same principal article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">that we had in English, and in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> most of them were running that very timely information about “The Catholic Church in the Modern World.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">We have also been delighted to observe the good response from your use of the Bible-study folder. Over half of the mail requests that we receive for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book indicate that they want to have a home Bible study too. Publishers that have written their name and phone number on the folder are having interesting experiences. A sister left the folder when placing magazines. The next day as she arrived home from service her phone was ringing. “Oh, I’m glad to catch you. I’ve been phoning all morning,” the housewife studies. Also, there was a new peak in regular pioneers, and 12,462 shared in the vacation pioneer service, which is wonderful! All this gives strong evidence of the fact that you deeply appreciate the privilege of being Jehovah’s “fellow workers.” And the fine increase in number of Kingdom witnesses shows that Jehovah has blessed your efforts with growth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Wliiie Jehovah could do it all by himself, he chooses to use earthly workers in the field. Paul prized highly his assignment in the work, and so do we.—1 Cor. 3: 6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> If sharing in the growth of “God’s building&quot; was encouraging to his earthly servants at that time of its beginning, how much more thrilling it is over 1,900 years later to be working with God and witnessing the tremendous growth of the organization that is praising Jehovah world wide now! Think of the privilege of working together with the living God and what an honor it is. Jehovah keeps encouraging us to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font9"> 2, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3) </span><span class="font9">at the other end said.- “I read those magazines and the folder over and over, and I do want to have that Bible study in my home.” During December too, if we continue to make good use of the study folder at every home, we may be able to start many more Bible studies, and how fine that would be I</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Isn’t it grand to be having a share in Jehovah’s service during this most thrilling time of human history? As we continue unitedly to put first the preaching of the Kingdom during the days ahead, we can be confident that yet grander blessings will come to us from the hand of our generous God. It is a pleasure for us to be working together with you in His service.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In putting first the preaching, what plans have you made to share in Kingdom work during December? Now we have a favorable time for preaching, and if we all arrange to have some part during December, perhaps we will reach a new peak of publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> How many do you know who have recently begun to associate with Jehovah’s organization but have not had a share yet in preaching the good news? Surely many of them would be grateful for the privilege. Do some of these newly associated ones qualify to report as publishers? Can you take one with you in your preaching work? We should be sure»the ones we take* into the service with us are really qualified according to the Scriptures. It is proper to check with them to make sure of this. Then we may expect progressive spiritual growth in the future.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The congregation book study servant has a key role In the spiritual growth of the congregation. As the congregation is made up of the individual book study groups, so the spirit and zeal of each book study group largely determines what the spirit of the congregation will be. The position of the book study servant is a vital one in the congregation, for the group of Jehovah’s people that have been placed under his care will reflect the zeal he shows and the shepherding he does. The book study servant is among those described at Isaiah 32:1, 2 as ‘.‘princes,” so he should be a source of refreshing strength to those whom he shepherds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Each one of us appreciates very much the spiritual strength gained from regular attendance and participation in the congregation book study. To conduct this study in a lively, instructive, faith-building manner is an important part of the book study servant’s work. It requires advance preparation and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE HELP US</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We have extra shifts working at the factory, and many of the Bethel family are working longer-than-usual hours to produce the tremendous amount of literature that is needed by our brothers around the world. Most of the branches outside of the United States are very low on campaign literature. In view of this, the Society plans to use all of its January book production to till orders for foreign-language-speaking branches. So, if there is any English literature that you do not already have and that you feel you will need for January and February, please be sure to order it at the same time that you submit your order for bound volumes of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> These orders may be submitted to Brooklyn starting December 9. We will try to fill all of them in December.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> During January and February, if you should find that you need some bound books, we will be glad to ship you any of the following ones: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand,&quot; What Has Religion Done for Mankind?, “New Heavens and a New Earth,&quot; “Your Will Be Done on Earth,&quot; “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,&quot;</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!&quot; God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font9"> We have a good supply of them, and there is also available a limited supply of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font9"> However, if you order items such as the study. But, in addition to this, If you are a book study servant, you have the vital responsibility of being a faithful undershepherd of the flock entrusted to your care. The words of Proverbs 27:23 certainly apply to you, saying, “You ought to know </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">positively</span><span class="font9"> the appearance of your flock. Set your heart to your droves.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What does it mean to “know positively the appearance of your flock”? Well, when you leave a meeting do you know if all those entrusted to your care were there? If someone was missing, or has missed several meetings, do you know why? If a brother or sister in your group has not been out in service of late, are you aware of the reason? Taking personal Interest in the spiritual well-being of each publisher is the way you can “know’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">positively</span><span class="font9"> the appearance of your flock.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> So, as a faithful undershepherd, be keenly interested in the spiritual advancement of each one in your care. Work with each one in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> book, these may be deleted from your order during January so that our entire production of about two artd a half million books that month can be used for export.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> We will be In the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">campaign then, and you will not need very many books. Of course, you may use whatever stock of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> books you have on hand, but please do not expect it to be replenished during January and February. Rather, let's concentrate on obtaining subscriptions and placing magazines, which are available in abundance. We surely do appreciate your help in this regard. It will assist us to keep all our brothers supplied with equipment for the ministry. ministry, giving encouragement and kind suggestions that will aid that one in having a fruitful ministry. If one is hesitant to comment at the meetings, go to him with encouragement and help him prepare to have a part If a problem begins to trouble one of those placed under your care and hinders that one in his service or faithful attendance at the meetings, go to him when you first see it. Talk to him. He may tell you what the problem is, and then you will be able to give Scriptural encouragement and help to overcome it. If the problem persists, do not delay in discussing it with the congregation overseer and asking for his help, at all times keeping him well informed as to the spiritual progress and activity of all in your book study group. Every publisher should feel at liberty to discuss his problems with the servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At Least One Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The following Interesting comment has been received by us: “As a congregation servant I have encouraged publishers in the unit to work territory effectively when they will be working with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font9">book and to call back at least once on each placement of it to give the recipient at least one opportunity to have a Bible study in his home. Probably if every placement of this book is thus handled many Bible studies will be started and many persons will eventually embrace Christianity. If some publishers place so many of these books that they cannot make all of the back-calls, they are invited to ask the servants for help so it can be arranged that some publishers help them to make at least one call on each placement of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book in an effort to start a Bible study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The main idea here is making at least one follow-up call on each placement of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book, with the specific objective of starting a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>s</sup> We think this is a very good plan of action and recommend that all publishers follow it. It is in harmony with the use of our new folder entitled “Would You Like to Understand the Bible?” We</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In January 19(59 we will begin the thirty-first </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign and it will continue for four months. We well remember the good success of the last </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign and the many blessings Jehovah gave, so we enter this campaign with confidence that more blessings are in store for us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> To be prepared for success, congregations and publishers should make plans now and set aside certain time for service. Check to see how many extra copies of the magazines you will need and increase your distributors’ orders as may be necessary. During the first two months of the campaign most issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will contain some articles based on the timely material that appears in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font9">book concerning God’s permission of should have a copy of this folder in every book that is placed, and the logical follow-up to it would be to give people an opportunity to have a home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> This will be something very practical for us as the hard months of winter are coming on. If we can start studies, it will help us to be regular in the service even though the wedther may be very cold or difficult. Perhaps during the worldly holiday season we may encounter some problems in trying to start the studies, so in places where it does Sot seem convenient to start a study uring December, give the people at least one opportunity during January to have a home Bible study. Continue keeping track of all addresses where you place a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book and make sure that some publisher calls back, even if you cannot, to offer the home Bible study program to everyone personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Did you know that less than 45 percent of all publishers are now conducting a home Bible study with someone? How many in your congregation are doing it? If you do not yet conduct a study, here is the opportunity you have awaited to teach someone the good news. Your Bible study servant can help you to begin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">wickedness, the &quot;last days,” and so forth. These very appealing subjects should help us to place individual copies of the magazines as well as .to obtain subscriptions. We can easily tie in the same sermon that was used during October on the theme “Is It Later than You Think?&quot; This is based on 2 Timothy 3 :l-5. So, with our experience in using this presentation previously, we should be able to swing right into the new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign with ease. It will be good to review some of the introductions for this sermon that were presented in the September </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> under “Your Service Meetings.” Of course, we are at liberty to make variations in the presentations according to the appropriateness for our territory.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font1">+ Twenty-four branches including the U.S. reported new publisher peaks in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">♦ For the first time, reports have been received from the smallest republic in Europe, San Marino. Four publishers there averaged 14 hours each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">♦ Italy began new service year with new peak of 13,070 publishers. Hours, back-calls and Bible studies up. With use of the &quot;Truth&quot; book, book placements have doubled over previous September. ♦ August saw new peak of publishers in Cuba, with averages of 14.4 hours, 7.9 back-calls and 1.1 studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">♦ Vietnam reports peak of 35 publishers. Rockets hit street where missionaries live, but all there are fine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">• Should publishers and pioneers order literature direct from the Society?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We rejoice to see more publishers of the good news each year and to receive their requests for more literature, as this is clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing. This year has been an especially busy one for the office and factory of the Society. Everywhere literature has been in great demand. Some individual publishers or pioneers have thought they might, be able to obtain literature more quickly if they ordered direct from the Society’s office, but this has only served to increase the volume of the mail and slow down the handling of orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will be a great help to the Society if all publishers and pidneers associated with congregations place their orders through the congregation. The congregations generally order literature once or twice a month and, to make it convenient for all concerned, it is appropriate for the congregation servant to make an announcement one week before the order is to be sent so publishers and pioneers can let the literature servant know what they will need In the way of special publications, such as foreign-language literature, bound volumes, etc. Then these items can be ordered along with the regular campaign literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">December will be a good month to offer the &quot;Yearbook&quot; to interested gersons with whom you have studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">o if you would like extra copies of the &quot;Yearbook,&quot; please let your literature servant know in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will also speed up the service we can render to you in the office if, when you have to renew your personal subscription, you can do it through the congregation. These suggestions are made because the Society desires to give better service In filling literature needs of each congregation.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)eax ^PubCiskus:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">We’re moving! It’s just across the way from 117 Adams Street to our new ten-story building. We’re glad too. During January we moved the entire shipping department and most of the book bindery to the new building. We have four large buildings now, each on its own city block, and all the buildings are connected by bridges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, before we got the moving job done, Brother Knorr asked ns to work nights because we were way behind in tilling literature orders. The arrangement was made so that nearly everyone in the Bethel family, including brothers and sisters working in the home and offices, could work at the factory, along with the regular workers there, from 7 to 9:30 p.m. four nights each week and Saturday afternoons for two weeks. Of course, we had to make arrangements for others in the New York congregations to care for our Bible studies, but we were able to have our Monday night Bethel </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study and ministry school, and get to the congregation meetings on Sunday. We surely were busy, but we all had a good time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, December proved to be an outstanding month. We were able to complete 1,134,653 bound books, a peak in production. Nothing like that was ever before accomplished in our factory in one month’s work. Of course, we had some new machinery with which to work, as well as extra hours in which to do it. Even so, we did not catch np with the orders for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font8">book, though we have made more than 1,600,000 copies since June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During December, besides printing all the magazines, we were able to finish the 1.96’8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> in English and Spanish. We also got out another supply of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font8"> We finished printing twelve editions of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> book in foreign languages. We completed the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font8"> book in French and Spanish and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth&quot;</span><span class="font8"> in Twl.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Them to Listen</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Have you found that on many calls it is difficult to give your entire Scriptural presentation, and that much time is spent trying to get a conversation started? If so, perhaps a greater effort to get the householder to converse and tell you how he feels about various matters will help. The benefits are obvious. By our asking appropriate questions and being good listeners we can find out how he feels about the subject we are discussing. We can also determine if he has a Bible, whether he reads it, and if he accepts it as authoritative. We might also learn whether he belongs to some church group. His response to our questions will enable us to adapt our presentation to fit his circumstances, and he will be more inclined to listen to something that interests him, won’t he?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In our introductory remarks this month while we are using the sermon. on “Finding Security” we might say: “Hello; I'm glad to find you at home. I’m making a brief visit to direct attention to what the Bible says about security and the real hope for mankind. All of us think about the lack of security in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">We printed the complete </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> in Italian and we hope to get it into the bindery In January. We also printed some of the pocket-sized English </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font8"> So, as you can see, our presses have really been busy. Stating it differently, this means that more than 900 tons, or 36 train carloads of 25 tons each, of papei<sup>-</sup>came into the factory and went through the presses to make publications during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of this makes us very happy. But we had still another exciting time at Bethel. Following the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study on Monday evening, December 25, Brother Knorr gave out the foreign assignments to the Gilead students now going through school. So they know where the world, don’t we? And we would like to see improved conditions....” In this way we let the person know our visit will be a brief one, what the subject is and that the Bible will be used. Also, our kindly manner encourages him to talk.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> We realize, too, that many people are inclined to be influenced by what their neighbors think or say. If we discern this to be the case in the territory we are working, we could say: &quot;Good morning; I’m glad you’re at home this morning. I’ve already had some very interesting conversations with your neighbors about something that affects all of us—security. Possibly you have given some thought to the unsettled conditions In the world. [Allow for response] Do you believe God has the power to change things if he wants to?” Again, we encourage the person to say something so we can find out his views, and mentioning our conversations with his neighbors may cause him to want to listen too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Another introduction we could try is this: “It’s good to find you at home. As a minister I’ve been brief-</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font8">they are going now and are looking forward to graduation and going to their assignments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Bethel certainly is a busy place and we like it that way. We hope that all of you are just as busy out there. You must be, or we would not be as busy as we are here. We are grateful that you keep us so busy printing publications for your needs and ours, as we share in the field service with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May Jehovah’s blessing be with you during the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> campaign, and may it be your good pleasure to help many more flee from Babylon the Great and find refuge in Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>

(Requirements to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before we actually Invite those with whom we study out into field service, It is important to help them to know the prerequisites. Whether your study is new or old, we suggest you discuss with them what requirements must be met by one before he goes out in service with Jehovah’s witnesses.

Speaker should emphasize that we are interested not merely in subscriptions but in the good that they will do the people who receive them. Give them the opportunity to obtain this vital information. Emphasize the following possibilities for obtaining subscriptions: Individuals with whom we formerly had Bible studies but who are not now studying; persons who used to be publishers but have not reported for six months; irregular publishers who often miss meetings.

Interestingly, 80,407 of the subscriptions during the &quot;Awake!” campaign were for “The Watchtower.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Discuss where to obtain subscriptions. Offer them to people with whom home Bible studies are being conducted. The Information in the magazines is pointed and practical; it will help them to see the need to get out of Babylon the Great, associate with Jehovah's people and become active praisers of God.

Point out their need for information published in “The Watchtower.” When calling on them, ask if they are still receiving it through the mail. Help them renew their subscription. In some cases subscriptions will be countable, in harmony with page 105 of the “Lamp” book. In other cases it is simply a loving service on our part to offer help. By all means do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">13 min: Concluding comments. Discuss matter of reporting time weekly. Consider reasons why some may find it advantageous to hand in their weekly report at Kingdom Hall on service meeting night instead of Sunday. Congregations having morning meetings on Sunday may find it helpful to get weekly reports on the service meeting night, whereas congregations having their meetings on Sunday afternoon may find there are advantages in getting the weekly report at the Kingdom Hall on Sunday. Draw suggestions from ,the audience and help them to reason as to what might be done so as not to overlook recording and accurately reporting field service activity. Might keep supply of report slips at home in desk or in &quot;Yearbook” as reminder, or fill out report immediately upon entering Hall, etc. Song 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Personally Read It?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During January we completed our congregation coverage of the book “Yottr Word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Is a Lamp to My Foot,” </span><span class="font8">and it was stimulating to discuss it together. But those who benefited most fully are the ones who not only were at the meetings but also took the time to read the material personally and look up the scriptures. Did you do that? We hope so. But, if not, we strongly suggest that you make that one of your personal study projects now. It will do much to deepen your appreciation for Jehovah’s organization, equip you to be a more effective minister and fortify you for the tests of your faith that lie ahead.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Talks That Are Well</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Do you realize that during the past two years you have heard public talks on more than eighty different subjects, each one jam-packed with fine Scriptural material? What a rich spiritual feast it has been! But, just as it is true that you like to savor fine dishes of physical food on more than one occasion, so, too, many of you have written to the Society saying that you hope there will be opportunity to hear these public talks again. We agree that it would be a fine thing for all of us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> So we recommend that, starting this spring, all the congregations go back to the beginning of the series of eighty public talks and schedule them a second time. And as you do it, work for variety.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> In most localities there is more than one brother that gives a particular talk. So, why not arrange for a different speaker in your congregation this time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> If you are a public speaker, inject freshness into your presentation. Knowing the local situation, you are in position to work in some fine illustrations that fit your particular audience and that will help them to appreciate the material more fully. Give careful consideration to this. Well-thought-out and appropriate illustrations help to make any talk live. Additionally, make good use of appropriate visual aids. Personal preparation for delivery is also vital. A good outline is not enough. You should be filled with your subject, have a clear grasp of each point and be enthusiastic about it. Is that the way you feel every time you get up to give a public talk? If so, both you and your audience are richly rewarded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Among the talks that we enjoyed during the past two years were those delivered by circuit and district servants. They, too, are well worth hearing again. For your benefit the Society is reprinting a group of eight of these outlines and will be sending them to each congregation early in March. You may arrange to use them, perhaps fitting one into your schedule every month or so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Now that nearly two years have passed since the start of the present series of talks, it may be a good time to reconsider the list of available speakers. No doubt there are some new speakers that are well qualified. On the other hand, some previously assigned may have moved away, so others will be needed to handle their subjects. We suggest that the congregation servants discuss this matter togeth-</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Hearing Again</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">er at the next circuit assembly and make any adjustments that appear to be advantageous, and at the same time they can be sure that enough brothers will have the eight new talks available for use in the circuit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Some small congregations may not have been able to arrange for speakers to deliver all eighty of the talks during the past two years. But we believe that the publishers would be very grateful if they could hear what is in those talks. So, during the next two years, if you cannot always arrange for a speaker, then why not at least get together as a congregation and read the outline and. look up the scriptures together? You have several copies of the outlines available in the congregation, so you can get them all out and have a fine discussion among yourselves. It will be stimulating and upbuilding, and in this way you will not be deprived of this provision that Jehovah has made for the blessing of his people.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Have you read the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">report on “Shocking Religious Persecution in Malawi”? It is in the February 1 issue, and is being followed by the article “Malawi’s AntiChristian Atrocities—A Shame on Africa,” in the February 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">When you read them, your urgent question will be, What can I do to help?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> You can publicize what has happened, and we urge you to do it as extensively as possible. Order extra copies of both magazines, and use them freely. Make them available to newspaper editors too. Do it right away. The more widely the atrocities are publicized, the greater the flood of mail will be making protest to the government in Malawi. Be sure to write a letter yourself. It may be that when President Banda realizes that he has brought worldwide indignation against his government, he will reconsider his course.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN DECEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even with severe weather conditions and sickness in many parts of the country, nevertheless, 315,972 publishers shared in the field ministry during December. This is an increase of 10,787 over December of last year. Many were no doubt out in service for the first time in December. We are glad to have them serving along with us in the joyful work of giving the final witness. When we consider the hours reported and the good results In placing literature, it is evident that a great shout of praise was given in December to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many, December meant time off from school and secular work. Many were able to ‘buy out’ time for vacation pioneer service. The 4,267 who shared In such joyful activity represented a considerable Increase over last December, when 3,504 vacation pioneered. No doubt those who vacation pioneered for the first time found It to be a faith-strengthening experience. And, with all of the interest found while vacation pioneering, there will be many joys in caring for the interest now by making back-calls and conducting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was especially encouraging to see the pioneer ranks Increase to 11,142. This Is the first time the 11,000 mark has been exceeded. We rejoice to have so many full-time workers serving along with us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Subscriptions on Magazine Routes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Magazine routes a good source of subscriptions? Definitely, and for the following good reasons. First of all, there is a friendly relationship established with the householder. The individual is acquainted with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">and so, to some extent, appreciates their value. He is used to receiving both of the magazines, so why not offer a double subscription?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> After our initial greeting we might say: “It’s been a pleasure to deliver the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines to you. They do contain interesting articles, don’t they? [Allow householder to express self] I can arrange for you to receive the magazines regularly through the mail. You would get </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> one week and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> the next week for an entire year on a contribution of only $2. In addition, six printed sermons (booklets) are given free to those who subscribe this month.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ge hi ng Them to Listen </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Coilt’d) </span><span class="font8">ly discussing the unsettled conditions that give people everywhere a great sense of insecurity. Many of your neighbors have mentioned that they have their own religion, and no doubt you have yours. [Allow for response] Tell me, do you feel there is any hope for improvement?&quot; If the person is hesitant to express himself, we could tactfully ask him to get his Bible to see what ’ it says. Acknowledging that he probably belongs to some church group may head off an objection, such as &quot;I have my own religion,” and it may also help to get a conversation started. People will generally talk about things that interest them, so our asking tactful questions about their religious affiliation may get them to talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Did you notice, in the above introductions, how questions are used effectively to get the householder to express himself and Involve him in the discussion? Of course, discernment is needed in how we ask questions so as not to antagonize, and we should be careful not to ask questions that might embarrass the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Getting the magazines regularly is one advantage in having the subscriptions. Generally it is best, to put the emphasis on what is contained in the magazines, only briefly mentioning how they come through the mail, how much they cost, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* If we detect that a person is hesitant about subscribing since he feels we will stop calling, then we can give assurance that we will continue to call and discuss articles with him. Demonstrating the topical method of Bible study and its advantages on such calls may result in a regular Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> If a person would rather not subscribe, encourage him to think about it and tell him you will gladly check with him at some time in the future. Then make a note on your records and in March or April you may want to check back with him. Those on our magazine routes have already demonstrated their interest. Let’s cultivate it by encouraging them to subscribe for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>e</sup> Of course, there are some persons in our territory who should more readily listen. Who? What about all those on whom we are making back-calls? They have already shown some interest in the Bible and they may even have some of the Society’s publications. Wouldn’t this be an excellent source of subscriptions this month? Yes; so why not check your list of baek-cails, and then arrange to set aside time to give these people attention?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> We have every reason to be positive and enthusiastic in offering the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> subscription to everyone. By giving careful thought to what we say in our introductory remarks and why It would be good to say things in a certain way we will undoubtedly (1) be able to give our Scriptural presentations more often, and (2) have many additional opportunities of encouraging people to subscribe. And, even if we don’t give our entire presentation on every call, nevertheless, we will be able to help many more persons to understand more clearly basic points from the Bible and how they are affected personally. We do have good reasons for wanting them to listen, don’t we?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Question</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9</span><span class="font6"> Have there been changes in the pre-enrollment requirements for pioneers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, there have been changes. No doubt some of you noticed them when reading page 195 of the “Lamp&quot; book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the past, some who wanted to enroll as pioneers found that their service report did not show the required twelve hours, nine back-calls and one Bible study per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, however, the requirement of hours is ten, and back-calls, six. With the changes in our reporting it is not hard to reach six back-calls per month. In fact, some who formerly found it difficult to have six countable back-calls in a month frequently have that many for just one week. How? Well, even if persons who took literature show no further interest when you call again, a back-call may still be counted, as long as contact is made. Each delivery of magazines on a route is also reported as a back-call. Likewise, a phone call to invite an interested person to a meeting or to tell him about one that you attended, or calling for him to take him with you to the Kingdom Hall, may be counted if you contact the interested person. So. it is not at all difficult to have back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for the home Bible study, all that is now required is that the applicant for pioneer service be conducting a study. He does not need to wait until he has had one for six months. If he is currently conducting it, that is sufficient. But, of course, as a pioneer he will work hard to develop more regular studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other requirements have not changed. Applicants must have been baptized ministers for six months, having reported some service each month for the past six months. They should also have a reputation for fine Christian conduct. Do you meet those requirements? Could you be a pioneer and enjoy the blessings that go with that service?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>NEW SERVICE YEAR OFF TO A THRILLING START!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All-Time Peak in Publishers!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> What a delight it is to tell you about the thrilling start to our new service year! Do you know what was accomplished in the field in September? A new all-time peak in publishers was reached, yes, even excelling the peak of last April! And this is just the first month of the new service year! There were 335,448 who shared in the field ministry, which is 1,776 over last April. Truly this shows that you feel the urgency of the times, that you are working hard to aid others to become praisers of Jehovah and that your efforts are being richly blessed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> With more workers we naturally expect that more work would be done, and that is what happened. Total hours were 5,085,956—well over the past service year’s monthly average of 4,769,281. What a fine evidence of the devotion of Jehovah’s people! Book placements, too, were remarkable. Especially is this so when we consider that most of the congregations had only a limited supply of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> books. Yet look what happened: You placed a total of 747,141 bound books! Up until</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qcait</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As you know, we have had a night shift operating at the factory since mld-September. Would you like to know of the results? Well, every morning at breakfast time we Beth-elites hear a report on the previous day’s production, and it is amazing what is happening! Why, it seems that almost every 17-hour day, combining the day and night shifts, we have a production of oVer 100,000 bound books and 500- to 600,000 magazines. In fact, production for the first six weeks of the new service year has reached over 2,800,000 bound books—over one third as many as were produced during the entire 1967 service year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With a serious dock strike threat-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May we had never placed this many books in one month. Isn’t that grand for the first month of the new service year? What would the report have been if all the congregations had had an ample supply of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font8">books? Well, for November all the congregations should have enough. We here at Bethel have two shifts working, and we are putting in overtime besides, to see to it that you are well supplied. We are thrilled at what we see taking place in the Kingdom-preaching work, and we are grateful that, along with all of you, we can have a share in it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> There is something else that is encouraging to us all. This is the splendid increase in meeting attendance. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study attendance during 1968 averaged 95 percent of all the publishers I This is up 10.3 percent this past year! There has been a continual Increase, rising from around 75 percent a few years ago. It is fine to see this keen appreciation for the Instruction that Jehovah is providing. Likewise with regard to the service meeting: Attendance increased from 75.4 percent ening, a special effort was made to get supplies of literature out to foreign branches before the strike deadline. How did that go? Well, from one of the brothers in the shipping department we heard that 280 tons of literature were shipped abroad in the first 27 days of September. That is an average of over 13 tons every working day. And on one outstanding day the total was 60 tons. Now nearly everything produced is being shipped to you brothers here in the United States. We are, on the average, sending out to you from the Brooklyn factory 15 to 20 tons of literature a day. Isn’t that a tremendous outgo of precious, life-giving truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">But that is not all. The demand </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font8"> 2, col. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">3) </span><span class="font8">to 81.3 percent—a 5.9-pereent increase. The Theocratic Ministry School attendance rose 5.8 percent, to 81.9 percent; and the congregation book study attendance- was up 4.4 percent, to 87.2 percent. This is fine and reflects a wholesome appreciation of spiritual things on your part.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> September’s thrilling report also makes it obvious that you are doing fine teaching with the aid of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> book. Of course, our purpose in placing it is to conduct home Bible studies, to help people get started on the way to eternal life. The report shows that, during September, Bible studies totaled 291,063. This means that you conducted nearly 40,000 more studies than in September 1967, when the figure was 251,414. Now, with the November campaign with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> book, the prospect for more of us to conduct Bible studies steadily improves, doesn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Can All Conduct Bible Studies?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Has the new book now made it possible for you to condiict a home Bible study where you were not successful in doing so before? Many brothers believe that it has! Without a doubt, many faithful and devoted publishers who were not including a home Bible study in their witnessing activity in the past will now find it possible to do so. Why do we say this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Primarily, It has to do with the simplicity of the material in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font8"> book. The arguments are not complicated or involved. The illustrations are simple and easily understood. Then there is the simplicity of the language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> There are other features that are built into the book that will aid us in conducting Bible studies. In the past, in preparing our students for opposition, it was necessary for us to gather this material ourselves </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font8"> S)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">20 min: “Spread the Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.&quot; Consider “Kingdom Ministry” insert material through “New Bible Studies.” After brief introduction by chairman he may ask questions for audience comment. Have certain publishers assigned to relate experiences briefly, highlight main points and express how they think points will help us in ministry. -Might have local experiences too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Capable publisher can demonstrate some points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “New Service Year Off to a Thrilling Start!” Convey enthusiasm over fine increases. Questions and answers, but chairman may comment occasionally to emphasize key points. On paragraph 9 young publisher might raise hand and offer objection, saying he doubts his ability to start a study. He is called to platform, and chairman reasons with him on opportunities to start studies with schoolmates, neighbors, others. Chairman should prepare so this is realistic and convincing. Local experiences on this can be related. Do same with paragraph 10 regarding older publishers. Could demonstrate points in paragraphs 7 and 8. if you have time, but see that point is really put across that most publishers can now conduct studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">2 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">3 min: Can You Vacation Pioneer in December? Capable brother reminds us that December Is a month when we put forth a special effort in the field ministry. See bottom of page 113 in “Lamp” book. It Is a month when many will want to vacation pioneer and especially will young publishers who have time off for the “holidays” be in a position to do so. Now is the time to make plans and apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Song</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “Spread the Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.” Consider material under subheading “From House to House with Brief Presentations” through “Regular Sermons.” After brief introduction by chairman, a few questions might be asked for audience participation. Then various suggestions and presentations may be analyzed and demonstrated. Get variety into this. Some may be discussed first, showing why it is good to do things a certain way, and then demonstrated. Some may be demonstrated first and then analyzed by chairman or audience. Experiences should be assigned ahead of time, related, main point highlighted and application made to congregation. Demonstrate a regular sermon. Be sure assignment is well rehearsed and fast-moving.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">16 min: Distributing the Word of Truth. A capable brother should be given this assignment. It should provide practical assistance to the publishers to aid them in placing the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,&quot; along with the &quot;Truth&quot; book it desired, in December. A great deal of helpful information on placing this Bible has been provided in previous Issues of “Kingdom Ministry/' In the issue of June 1968, page 2, are suggestions for giving a sermon using the Concordance (&quot;important Bible Words for Quick Reference&quot;) found at the back of the &quot;New World Translation.&quot; Some may want to try this, inasmuch as we will thus be demonstrating a fine feature of the “New World Translation,&quot; which we are ottering. In the issue of June 1967, page 2, are comparisons that show the superiority of the &quot;New World Translation.” In the issue of December 1967, page 4, are suggestions on what to say when householders say they have a Bible. Publishers may use any sermon they choose. Some will want to place the &quot;New World Translation&quot; and the &quot;Truth” book on a contribution of $1.25. Be sure to demonstrate this latter offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">17 min: &quot;Spread the Truth That Deads to Eternal </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life.”</span><span class="font7"> Consider remaining insert material. Chairman may present some portions of material as talk and some may be considered by questions and answers. Assign some of the experiences to certain capable publishers ahead of time so they can be briefly and Interestingly related, then audience or chairman may comment on what we can learn from the experience and how we can apply Ideas in our ministry. Local experiences may be included if there is time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">15 min: &quot;Do They Really Believe It?” Could be assigned to Bible study servant. He may discuss material with two or three book study servants. After considering material, one or two of the group might demonstrate how they would question student to find out what he believes and then what teaching methods could be used really to convince and build heart appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: How Many Will Share in December? All In the congregation should be encouraged to share in the field ministry this month. It would be entirely appropriate for the congregation to work for a new peak in publishers in December. See pages 113 and 114 of “Lamp” book. Possibly there are some with whom we are conducting Bible studies who could qualify for the field service this month. See pages 107 to 110 of &quot;Lamp” book. Possibly two members of the committee can discuss these matters and outline what the congregation will strive to do as publishers work together to encourage one another to nave a full share in December activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for that</span><span class="font8"> especially timely October 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> has surpassed the normal demand by over 3,500,000 copies. Imagine! On the average your orders for this issue have been three times that of your regular requirement, and it has not been uncommon for us to receive orders for as many as 4,000 or 5,000 copies, and in several instances 10,000. Here in Brooklyn we are printing 6,400,000 of this issue. So excited about it are most of the brothers in the field that we are receiving many second, third and fourth special orders, often by long-distance phone call. A good number of congregations have expressed their desire to have enough to be able to place a copy in every home in their territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To meet all of this vastly increased demand from the field. Brother Knorr suggested that brothers here might volunteer to go back to their posts of duty In the factory for two or three hours after supper on convenient evenings and on Saturday afternoons. This we are now doing, and we are glad that the upsurge in the field ministry requires it. It is evident that Jehovah is prospering the activities of his people. What a marvelous time in which to be living!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May Jehovah's blessing be on all of you as you keep on, with us, remembering our Grand Creator.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SPREAD THE TRUTH THAT LEADS TO ETERNAL LIFE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13">H</span><span class="font9">OW appropriate the title of our new book is, “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life”! Do you not agree that it contains the truth that people need to start them on the road to eternal life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From all over the world come expressions of great enthusiasm and deep appreciation for our new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book. Typical of the response is that of one publisher who wrote: “Words fail to express my joy and appreciation for the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.</span><span class="font9"> I have never read anything as plain and yet tactful, simple and yet so understanding and designed to help people think. It is truly an instrument to aid all who are desirous of coming to the knowledge of the truth that leads to eternal life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demand for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book has been so heavy that in September the Society’s Brooklyn factory added a special night shift. This will increase production substantially so as to help fill the orders that are pouring in. Indeed, at one time during August the demand for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> books exceeded the supply by over one and a half million copies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Already, by the end of August, well over three million copies had been bound at the Brooklyn factory. And the book is now available in six languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. The Society is working toward publishing it in fifty languages by the end of 1969. What a tremendous witness this will give as it is spread throughout the world! It is just as Jesus foretold: “This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">good news</span><span class="font9"> of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Switching to “Truth” Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In regard to switching to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book where studies were already in progress, there have been striking results. One brother and his wife who had been studying with an elderly couple switched to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book and wrote: “After completing the first chapter as outlined at the assembly, we thought the husband was going to cry. He was amazed at how plain and self-explanatory and straightforward the new book is, and is so delighted with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister switched to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book with a person who had made little progress and was previously responding sluggishly. The sister reported that there was an immediate response to the new book’s simple, warm and appealing presentation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The experience of a brother demonstrates the quickening effect the new book is having. He writes: “On the last Sunday in July, we switched to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book in our study with a family. Immediately all became alert and took an active part. One young daughter who had not even studied her lesson was able to answer the logical questions that called for reasoning. In the study also was a young lad who would never take part, but who would wait for the son of the family to finish so they could go out together afterward. On this Sunday, he agreed to read a paragraph and also did very well in the review. I was amazed and could not understand what brought about the change. But upon thinking about it, I feel it definitely was the new book and its simple, direct way of presenting matters that attracted him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book stimulates interest in Bible study is evident also from the many experiences showing new studies being started. In one instance, at the district assembly in San Bernardino, California, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book was given to one of the truck drivers who was bringing supplies to the assembly. He read it that night and when he came back the next day he asked for a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister began studying the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book with a mother and her children. After just three studies, and reading additionally on her own, she saw the need to get out of “Babylon the Great.” She wrote a letter to the clergyman of the church that she had been attend-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ing, telling him to remove her name and the names of her children from the church membership roll. In the letter she gave a fine witness and also said to the clergyman: “Maybe you too will examine your personal beliefs and religion and the Holy Scriptures and find that you are practicing more of man’s laws than God’s laws. But it isn’t man that gives us eternal life. It’s God who is going to give eternal life to those who are worshiping in spirit and truth and in full harmony with his Word the Bible.” So in a short time, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book enabled this person to see • her responsibility to Jehovah and to take appropriate action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From House to House</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">with Brief Presentations</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, to start new studies in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book, we must first get it into the hands of the people. One of the best ways to do this is in the house-to-house ministry. And so many brothers report that the book is very easy to place. One brother took ten </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> books into a territory that was considered very unfruitful. He called on thirteen homes and placed all ten books!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just how can you present the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book from house to house? It is suggested that you try a variety of ways to see which gets the best results for you in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since our purpose is to start Bible studies, we could try the direct approach. After introducing ourselves, we might say: “We’re calling to encourage Bible discussions in the home to build faith in God. We’d like to demonstrate an excellent method of learning the basic truths of the Bible with the aid of this book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.</span><span class="font9"> May we step in for a few moments?” If the invitation is accepted, direct the householder to the first paragraph in the book and start a study. Where the study is refused, offer the book and arrange to call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You could also try many other types of brief presentations. One could be similar to the following: “We’re calling briefly to show you something very special. It is this fine new book. [Show </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book.] In a short time it will enable you to learn all the basic teachings of the Bible. It is yours for a contribution of only 25 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Other brothers have used this brief presentation: “Our purpose in calling is to assist you to learn more about the hope for the future that the Scriptures hold out. This book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</span><span class="font9"> says about this: [In chapter one, read part or all of paragraph one and first sen-fence of paragraph two]. The book shows clearly from your own Bible what that hope is and how you can enjoy it. This copy is yours on a 25-cent contribution.” Using this presentation, a brother placed five </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> books in less than two hours, and three other books besides, for at times he offered the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font9">book with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Use the Illustrations</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Other brief presentations can utilize the illustrations. If we choose to feature the one on page four, we might say: “We’re calling because so many people wonder what the future holds. But did you know that within our own lifetime God has promised to bring peace and happiness world wide? This book [show </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book] illustrates this point here on page four. [Turn to illustration.] Notice the scripture quoted there. Would you mind reading it? [Householder may read scripture, but if not, read to him.] Wouldn’t you like to live under such conditions? [Householder may respond.] The very first chapter of this book shows how near these blessings are. We’d like to leave this copy with you on a small contribution of just 25 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you choose to use the illustration on page 95, you may try an approach similar to this one: “We’re calling because of the deep concern we all have about the growing rate of crime and lawlessness everywhere. Haven’t you wondered what all these terrible conditions mean? [Allow householder to comment.] The Bible’s explanation of this is very satisfying. In this book [show </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font9">book] chapter 11 is entitled: [Read title from page 94]. The diagram on the next page illustrates what this chapter explains, that we’re living in the last days of this wicked system of things. [Refer to diagram, offer book.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If we use the illustration on page 85 we could say: “We’ve stopped by briefly to bring you a copy of this new aid to understanding the Bible. [Show </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book.] It answers a question that many people have when they pray the ‘Lord’s prayer’ and say, ‘Thy kingdom come.’ The question is, When will God’s kingdom come? Notice the picture on page 85. [Have householder read caption, or read to him.] On the next page the section ‘Fulfillment of “the Sign” ’ shows clearly when God’s kingdom comes and what it will do for mankind. [Offer book.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answering and Asking Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When householders have questions or problems, we can refer them to the chapters that provide the answers. One Catholic householder expressed concern because her church was making too many changes that seemed to be taking people away from God, but she was hesitant about taking the book. The publisher showed her chapter 14 on “How to Identify the True Religion” and called her attention to the italicized points identifying the true religion. She took the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A man who was thinking about becoming a member of one of Christendom’s churches asked for an explanation of the 144,000 mentioned in Revelation. The brothers discussed it briefly from the Bible and then turned to chapter 9, “The Reason Why a ‘Little Flock’ Goes to Heaven.” He said he was anxious to read that chapter as soon as his wife finished her copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book! She had obtained it six days earlier and had only one more chapter to read!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As you know, most of the time householders will not raise questions. Then why not raise them yourself? For example, we may say: “We’re calling to answer a question that almost every person asks, and probably you have too. It is this: [Hold up chapter 8 on page 65 and read title]. Note what the first paragraph says. [Read.] The first sentence in the next paragraph asks: [Read]. This chapter explains the answer in a very satisfying way. [Offer book.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Who has not wondered about the question: Where are the dead? This could be featured in a brief presentation, with the first paragraph on page 34 used to stimulate interest. Or we could ask the householder if he would like to live in a world where there is no crime or violence, but where there is perfect peace and happiness. Then we could turn to chapter 12, “Righteous Rule Makes Earth a Paradise,” reading part or all of paragraph 1 and referring to the illustration on page 108.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are other basic questions we can raise that are covered by other chapters. And, of course, there are other simple, direct ways we can offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book from house to house. Experiment with some of them to see which ones get results for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Regular Sermons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We can also try regular sermons, reading one, two or even three scriptures from the Bible before introducing the book. We can determine the number to use from the householder’s response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One sermon many find easy to use is based on Psalm 37. We might say something like this: “Good morning. I’m glad I found you at home. I’m calling concerning God’s promise to bring peace to mankind. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live at a time when we wouldn’t be afraid to go out at night in any neighborhood and when we wouldn’t even need locks or peepholes on our doors? [Refer to these if their door has them. Allow householder to respond.] But do you think we can have that kind of peace, with so many people in the world stirring up trouble? [Householder may respond.] Notice what Psalm 37:10 says about this: [Read]. Can you imagine, not being able to find a wicked person anywhere! And God promises to destroy only the wicked, not honest-hearted persons. That’s why verse 11 says: [Read]. Wouldn’t you like to live when there will be that kind of peace on earth? [Allow comment.] Well, in verse 34 we find out what we have to do: [Read, then tie in with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font9">book].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are many other fine sermons we can choose. Work with those that get the best results in your territory. Tie them in directly with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Other Ways to Place “Truth” Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Can you think of other ways to place the new book? How about offering it with the current magazines for 35 cents on magazine day? One sister placed 45 books in this way in one month! Another offered the book when people gave him more than the cost of the magazine, and he placed several. We may not always have such success, but even if we place one copy of the new book occasionally in this manner, it paves the way for a possible Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Offer the book when calling back on magazine placements. In one hour a publisher placed four </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> books in this way. Another placed several on his magazine route by offering it with the current magazines for 35 cents. That this can be productive is seen from the experience of a pioneer who reported that all eight of her Bible studies resulted from following up magazine placements!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then, too, do not forget your relatives. True, in the past you may have tried to witness to them without much success. But try again and let them have a copy of the new book. Perhaps they will now respond to its simple, direct approach. A sister writes in this regard: “We visited our relatives right after the assembly and my grandfather took the book, saying that he would be glad to read it. By the time we left, he was halfway through and enjoying it very much. He had formerly been violently opposed to the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In another letter, a brother writes this about a relative: “My grandmother who has been opposed to the truth for many years and made no secret of it has yielded to the ‘blue bombshell.’ She consented to a Bible study in it because of my post-convention enthusiasm about it. Now she is attending the Tuesday night congregation book study because she ‘wants to learn the truth.’ A Catholic since birth, my grandmother after attending just one meeting said, ‘I’m having the time of my life.’ After all her years of faithfully attending her church she ‘never met people as friendly as the Witnesses.’ So I thank Jehovah for providing a powerful new publication that is destined to lead many sheeplike ones to God’s theocratic organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Also, offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book to those you meet in your daily activity, such as tradesmen or neighbors that call at your home. Make a habit of keeping a supply of books handy so you can offer them to these persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How about those with whom you work at your secular employment? In some instances, merely leaving the book on the desk, or reading it during lunchtime, has aroused the curiosity of others. One sister placed five books in this way. Usually, however, it is more productive to take the initiative and tactfully, at the proper opportunity, offer the book to those with whom you work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the book is pocket size, you can carry a copy with you when you travel to and from work, and at other times. Then, when you witness incidentally to others, you can leave a copy with them. One brother on a train trip took along an extra copy with this in mind. After striking up a conversation with a man sitting alongside him, he gave a brief witness and offered the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book. The man said he would be glad to take it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whenever you do place a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book, endeavor to start a Bible study. If this is not possible on the initial call, then make it a point to call back soon. If the person with whom you place a copy lives outside your territory, let him know that you would like to have someone call back to have a Bible discussion with him. Then contact the congregation that is located where he lives and give them the necessary information. If you do not know which congregation is nearest, write to the Society and the information will be forwarded to the proper congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Really, then, we all want to take every opportunity to get the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book into the hands of sheeplike persons. Without a doubt, this will bear fruit in the months to come as many of these persons progress toward Christian maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time left to accomplish the ingathering work grows ever more limited. What a privilege it is to have a share in this grand, speeded-up ingathering work at this time! So “pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:16) Feel this sense of urgency and take the time, yes, make the time, to spread </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font9"> to all those still hungering and thirsting for righteousness. —Matt. 5:6.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do They Really Believe It?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Some time ago a publisher was given a home Bible study by another publisher who had conducted it for about two years. During this time the student had studied her lessons and had been able to answer the questions from the book. It was thought that progress was being made. The new publisher, however, began to do a little probing. She asked review questions that made the student reveal not just what she had learned from the book, but also what her real convictions were. The result? It was discovered that the student did not really believe what she was learning! She still clung to her previous religious beliefs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We need to be discerning as we teach. Sometimes the student will give the correct answer from the book because he knows that is what you expect and will satisfy you. Some parents have found much the same to be true of their children at times. They will answer the parents correctly because they know it is what the parents want and will please them. But deep down are they really convinced and is the right impression being made on their minds and hearts? Being constantly alert so that we know how the truth is being received will be a great help as the study progresses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> What kind of questions might you ask In order to learn what you want to know? If you ask how the material applies to them personally or if you ask questions that will give them the opportunity to express their personal convictions, then you will likely learn what you want to know.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> For example, you might ask, &quot;Who is Jehovah?” The answer might be: “We have learned that he is the Creator, not a part of any trinity, but the Almighty Sovereign.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">This answer likely would not reveal any personal conviction. But suppose you asked, “Who is Jehovah and what does knowing him mean to the Christian?” The answer might be: “Why, Jehovah is the only true God! He is the only One who can correct all wrongs and give us eternal life! He is the one we should dedicate our lives to and pray to!” This would be different. It reveals not just knowledge but belief and conviction.—Matt. 16:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>0</sup> When should we begin asking such questions? This is for each publisher to decide. We should use good judgment in the matter. We should not expect too much of our students at first. It takes time- to take in accurate knowledge and then build conviction. But when the study is established and progress is being made, it is good to begin thinking in this direction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> If you do learn that your student is only taking in knowledge but is not being convinced, what will you do? Will you face him with the matter? Certainly this won’t be necessary early in the study. Likely It will be best to continue the study as you normally would but determine that you will be an even better teacher so that the student will not only take in knowledge but will be convinced that it is the truth and will develop a heart appreciation for it. Some fine suggestions on how you might do this are to be found in the “Lamp” book under the subheading! “Home Bible Studies,” beginning on page 92.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> So, we see that it Is not just a matter of having a study and conducting it each week. There are a number of things we can do to help our students make the right kind of progress. One thing we can do Is find out what they believe and then help them believe the truth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">and then arrange to work it into the study. Now this has been incorporated into the book and is presented early in the study, on page 16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Formerly we worked out our own methods of directing the student to the organization and helping him to see the need to share the truth with others. This will undoubtedly still be done to some extent, but in chapter three of the book Interested ones are encouraged to speak to others about what they learn. On page 130 they are invited to come to the Kingdom Hall and on page 138 they are urged to continue coming. Then on page 185 they are invited to share in the house-to-house work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Who in your congregation has had some difficulty in starting Bible studies? The younger publishers? Then why not work things out in the congregation so that they can be given help? Parents might assist their children to see opportunities for starting studies with schoolmates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> Are there some older publishers In your congregation that have held back from conducting studies, thinking they are not capable? Why not work things out in the congregation so that they can be given help? Maybe arrangements can be made for studies to be turned over to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> There is no doubt that this new instrument Is a loving provision that will make it possible for many more publishers to have a greater share in the urgent preaching and teaching work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Short Time Remaining</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> How often does your congregation cover its territory? Do you reach every home at least three times a year? Is it a thorough coverage each time, getting each not-at-home and speaking to different occupants in the house? In view of the shortness of the remaining time, it makes one stop and think, doesn’t it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Also, after you have found interested persons and started home Bible studies with them, think how long It takes to teach them the truth, bring them along to dedication and baptism, train them in the field ministry and assist them to progress to maturity 1 Yes, we all do well to think seriously about having a good share noio in the door-to-door work, not postponing it until some later time.—Mark 13:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> There are other reasons for sharing fully In the door-to-door work. With the Improved method of conducting home Bible studies, many • students will be making a decision much sooner than has been done in the past. Some will show the necessary initiative and will act They will progress toward maturity much faster and the study can be stopped sooner. Others will not act on the knowledge they take in and we will discontinue the study. Thus it will not be a matter of conducting a study for years as some have done in the past but there will be a concluding of studies and a need to start new studies. It will require regular and effective door-to-door work in order for these new studies to be started. It will be good to be conducting more than one study at a time so that we will be regular in this feature of the work and thus will always be teaching someone the truth if one of our studies is discontinued. Additionally, if you are especially effective in the door-to-door work and in starting studies, you can have the blessing of starting studies for other publishers In the congregation to conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> No matter what kind of person you meet at the door, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font8">book can be presented with a strong appeal. There will be those who have a religion and who believe in God. Tell them we are encouraging honest-hearted persons to see the wisdom of examining their religion in view of the critical times in which we live. You might open the book to page 11, read the chapter title, “Why It Is Wise to Examine Your Religion,” and read some choice portions from the chapter. You could read Matthew 7:13, 14 right from the book in paragraph two and comment on it, emphasizing that really only a few are on the road leading to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Or, you might meet some who have no religion, and, in fact, have lost Interest in just about everything because of the injustices they see taking place throughout the earth. Some of these young people who have joined modern protest movements have recognized the truth immediately upon having it presented to them. To these who say there is nothing worthwhile believing in and working for you might show chapter 14, “How to Identify the True Religion.” Present some of the arguments or read directly from the book. Remember, the truth appeals to people of all kinds, but it is necessary to be out in the territory regularly In order to find them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Are you using the new folder, “Would You Like to Understand the Bible?” in your door-to-door work? By all means have an ample supply with you at all times and make good use of them. Whether the person you talk to takes literature or not, try to leave one with him. Slip one under the door when no one is home. Be sure to put one in each book that you place. Our goal is to start studies, not just place books. The folder will help you to start studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Are you having a full share in the door-to-door work? Why not review your service schedule and your personal circumstances to see if some adjustments should be made? We want everyone to have ample opportunities to hear and accept the truth while there is yet time. Let’s be out in the field where we can talk to people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC NEWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Publishers in Newark, New Jersey, Roseville Unit, averaged 17.2 hours for August. A letter of explanation said: “The reason our publishers' hours were so high was due to the incentive the brothers had to 'pioneer for a day' during the month, to give a little extra sacrifice to Jehovah. Many would love to pioneer, but cannot. But they could see their way clear to pioneer for a day.&quot; ♦ In Brazzaville, Congo, 1,380 heard public talk at district assembly. Dramas were played on tape in Monokutuba language as brothers acted out parts. ♦ Ethiopia enjoyed seventh new peak this year when 313 publishers reported in August, a 41-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Korea had ten new peaks of publishers in a row; Japan enjoyed new peak of publishers every month of service year. ♦ Attendance of 887 at Fiji district assembly made it largest ever there. ♦ All sessions of district assembly in Okinawa were attended by more persons than total of 318 publishers.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">v^ueiuon 'J5ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• In concluding comments at our meetings, -is it always necessary to list all the meetings and service arrangements for the week to come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No, if the ones at meetings are acquainted with arrangements for service and meetings, it is not necessary to make repetitious announcements each week. The one making announcements might ask himself, Is. there something the publishers or newly interested persons present do not know or should be reminded about?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the book study brief reminders are given about service arrangements, or any change from the normal schedule. If some outstanding point is to be considered at the next service meeting or certain publications will be needed, that might beneficially be mentioned. The service meeting program is outlined in “Kingdom Ministry” so it is not necessary to read this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Assignments for the Theocratic. Ministry School should be shown on the information board and individuals should be advised personally. If the school servant wants to mention the names of those having assignments the next week, he may do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In concluding comments for the service meeting the overseer generally gives encouragement to share in service on the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Congregations having meetings on Sunday morning would do well to take a few minutes to discuss the afternoon field service activity. If interested persons are present for the first time, something can be said about arrangements for various meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why not use variety in connection with announcements? Occasionally, use questions to draw comments from the audience about arrangements for service and meetings. Of course, when special letters need to be considered, adjustments need to be made by the overseer so meetings do not run overtime.</span></p>

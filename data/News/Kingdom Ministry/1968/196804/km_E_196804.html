<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 1968</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.&quot;—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. XI NO. 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My dear Brothers and Sisters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just think of it! Seven months of the service year have gone already! When you are busy, time flies, and here we are in April! And April Is a special month to all of us, for we will be celebrating the death of the Lord Jesus Christ—the death on which our lives depend. Surely that was a wonderful arrangement Jesus made: All of us getting together once each year—this year on April 12 after sundown. At the Lord’s supper the anointed and the “other sheep” will keep In remembrance the marvelous thing that Jesus did—dying on our behalf and keeping integrity to his heavenly Father. We certainly want to invite everyone we know who believes in Jesus Christ to attend with us on that memorable occasion, don’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just the other day I had occasion to check through the January reports world wide, and I was surprised, as you will be surprised, to learn that Jehovah’s witnesses are now conducting 941,340 weekly Bible studies, as compared with last year’s total of 867,009. So that brings up the' question: How many of these can we bring to the Memorial celebration? We hope all of these and many more will accept the invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And how many of these 941,340 and more new Bible students will be encouraged to join us in telling other people what Jesus has done for mankind? Do they have enough faith in Jesus Christ to do what he did when he was on earth, namely, preach the Kingdom message? Doubtless you are Impressing on the minds of these new students week by week the need to tell other people what they have now learned about the Bible. How happy we would all be if many more of these students could get the full significance of the words: “Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first”! (Mark 13:10) It is urgent that this good news be preached before Armageddon breaks upon all the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In accord with Jesus’ instructions we have been privileged to make</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Bring Them with You!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Festivals are special occasions to be enjoyed by a community or group of persons, not to be celebrated alone. In ancient Israel three principal festivals were held at Jehovah’s direction, and ‘every male was to appear before Jehovah God in the place that he would choose.’ But were they to come alone? No. The rejoicing was to be shared in company with sons and daughters, slaves, alien residents, the fatherless and the widows in the land. All were to be brought together before Jehovah God.—Deut. 16: 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Christian servants of Jehovah likewise enjoy regular gatherings and are commanded to encourage one another as we ‘behold the day drawing near.’ The larger the gathering, the greater the joy. Last many disciples during the past six months, and many of these are already publishing the Kingdom truths. Out of the 197 countries reporting during this service year, 87 have reached higher peaks than during the previous year, 46 of them have at least a 10-pereent increase, and 33 of them a 20-pefcent increase. So, in each congregation we might ask ourselves, How did we do In March, and what is the prospect for April?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Are some of those with whom you study ready and. qualified to share in preaching the good news along with you? Are they seriously thlnk-fng about dedicating their lives to Jehovah? Are you, as a teacher, seeing to it that some day they will be able to answer the eighty questions in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Lamp</span><span class="font10"> book? And is it not high time to Invite them to go along and observe your ministry in the field? If we are to make disciples out of people of all nations, then we have to work hard at It</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And have you thought about inviting these new students to attend one of the “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies this sumyear at Memorial 2,195,612 assembled before Jehovah. It was the first time in the modern history of Jehovah’s witnesses that over two million individuals came together for a special occasion of praise. Not everyone attending was one of Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses, but our wish is that in due time all of this great crowd of people will worship Jehovah regularly. And we hope more will come this year.—Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The Memorial, held on Friday night, April 12, will offer an opportunity for us to do more than attend personally. Bring all In the family and more. We conduct Bible studies with many such people. Memorial time is an outstanding op-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 4, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font10"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">mer? But even before that you will want to have them come and hear the special public talk on March 31, and from there it is an easy matter to suggest that they share in distributing the April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">containing the text of the talk, from house to house. Sometime they will have to show their faith by their works, and can you think of any better time than the month of April? It certainly will be interesting to see how our report for April turns out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh yes, March 10 we had the Gilead graduation—a delightful one —and already many of the graduates of the forty-fifth class are on their way. We hope that by April 1 all of them will be busy in their new assignments, sharing in all the activity of that big month of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of my warm love for all of you as together we anticipate the celebration of the Memorial supper.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 7</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Bring Others to the Festival. Song 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Introduction, text, comments, Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: “Bring Them with You!” Questions and answers. Include mention of number of home Bible studies now being conducted; also how many attended Memorial there last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">16 min: Welcome Interested Persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1 min.) Chairman says we hone many newly Interested persons will come to Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Servants are interested in them. Two servants discuss plans for Memorial and who will be assigned to welcome the new attenders. Hope everyone regularly attending meetings will be taking interest in them; all can share in the welcoming, showing friendliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1 min.) Chairman explains we want to know now to make them welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Demonstration showing publisher bringing newly interested one into Kingdom Hall. Introduces him to two or three others who carry on model conversation, this to let everyone know how to converse with new attenders. May ask where they are from, how long they have lived there, and such other neighborly questions, and mention what enjoyment has been received personally by attending meetings at Kingdom Hall. Hope they will enjoy being here too, etc. Some features in hall may be explained, such as yeartext, territory map, library, or whatever congregation may have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font9"> min.) Chairman encourages all present to bring newly interested ones. Also to try to bring them to other meetings after Memorial. We want them to associate, gain blessings of fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">2 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Concluding comments. Branch letter. “How Did We Do in February?” Progress of subscription campaign. Announcements on all arrangements for Memorial, transportation, etc., as well as weekend activities. Song 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Extending Mercy to Others. Song 117.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Introduction by chairman. Two publishers (vacation pioneers, if available) discuss text and comments prior to going into service. Mention enjoyable vacation pioneer experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: “Just Say ’Come!’ ” A talk. 28 min: Presenting the Good News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Demonstrate several presentations of magazines appropriate to your territory and the thinking of the people there. Examine special issues for an outstanding point or article that will appeal locally. Not necessary to use wording in Presenting the Good News, as it is only a suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Two publishers discuss plans to get a new publisher interested in going along for field service. As a publisher says 'Come ’ must remember each individual is different; important to know personality and how best to bring up the subject. Can relate some experiences or tell person how interesting it is to see the reactions of people to spiritual things these days. It is service to Jehovah, it is for the blessing of the people, or whatever they feel will appeal to their own Bible students who are about ready to share in preaching work. Magazine work is easy way to start new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Local experiences in placing special “Watchtower” issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate announcements and refer to &quot;Yearbook,” page 200, 113, on local territory. Song 34.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) A talk. Where and why attend. Remember, some facilities overtaxed last year, so please note suggestions for certain circuits. (May use information on page 127 of '‘The Watchtower.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Everyone in attendance has Room Request form. Consider line by line to be sure all understand how to fill it out when decision made on which assembly they will attend. Explain form briefly. (Start with &quot;One for Each Room.”) Where to mail form. Rooms in private homes —witnessing advantages. When to arrive. Hotel (motel) rooms—best prices by writing convention office. Write, wire or phone hotel if arriving late (after 6 p.m.). May receive private home assignment instead of hotel (motel) in small cities with few of them. No trailer park or tent areas run by Society, but will find place for you in commercial trailer park if available. Be sure to write clearly. Send Room Requests to convention city you will attend four to six weeks before convention begins, at address on back of request form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) Go over Volunteer Service form with congregation. Refer to Question Box in August 1967 “Kingdom Ministry.” Turn filled out forms over to congregation servant to send to convention city (not to Brooklyn).</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Advocate Christ’s Blood for Mankind's Salvation.—Heb. 9:14. Song 118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6 min: Introduction. New publisher asks study conductor meaning of day's text; conductor explains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on theme for May. See &quot;Watchtower,” December 1, 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Question Box. Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">26 min: Suggested presentations for May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1 min.) Chairman explains some may wish to use sermon on theme &quot;God Is Alive!” and tie It in with May offer, but any sermon may be used. We will review sermon on Jer. 10:10 and 2 Pet. 3:13, 14 from December 1966 &quot;Kingdom Ministry.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Two publishers demonstrate sermon. May demonstrate variety of ways to tie in sermon with Chapter One of &quot;Impossible to Lie” book and Chapter Ten of “Evolution” book. Go right into chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman mentions that in some territories circumstances are different, people not patient enough to listen to sermon or busy, others show little interest in Bible. In such places publishers may have better success approaching door with book in hand. Book itself may be used effectively as basis for what we say; often more books placed this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 mln.) Two publishers demonstrate offer, highlighting &quot;Impossible to Lie” book. After friendly greeting, publisher says: &quot;You have no doubt heard talk these days that God is dead. Do you believe that is possible?&quot; Householder replies he believes there is a God. Publisher continues: &quot;I agree with you. What we all need now is strong faith, because there is so much talk of atheism (and/or communism) in the world. From time to time we meet people who do not believe in God or think he is dead. What are we going to tell them? How can we defend our faith?” Publisher opens book to first chapter and says: &quot;This book, in the very first chapter, has the evidence that God lives. Here on pages 10 and 11 are a few of the facts.&quot; Shows pages. “It is being left at the homes in this neighborhood along with the book ‘Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?’ for a contribution of only 75 cents. I would very much like to leave these copies with you.” Offer accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1 min.) Chairman says in some cases publisher may prefer to feature &quot;Evolution” book, especially where householder is busy, has guests or is about to go somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Demonstrate. Publisher gives friendly greeting. Householder says he is sorry but he is just getting dressed to go out. Publisher says: &quot;I see you are busy so I do not wish to detain you. I came today to brin$ some important information to you in the form of this book ‘Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?’ All of us should have the answer to that question. The book is only 25 cents. May I leave this copy with you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Chairman points out how this type of presentation allows for placement of many books. Publishers should always make notation of placements and call back when householder has more time to talk or may have Questions about what has been read in tne book. Presentations such as with &quot;Impossible to Lie” or &quot;Evolution” are simple and direct, so ought to be useful in helping those we started in magazine witnessing during April to take up another feature of service in May, offering books. If we can open book and show householder something, putting book in the hand, usually results in more placements. &quot;Life Everlasting” may be offered to busy people quickly by opening to picture in front and referring to Romans 8:20, 21 appearing there. Offer is the two books for 75 cents, but may step down to one book, or finally to two magazines. A free booklet is given with each large book placed. May should be a leading month for book distribution. Know your territory and present offer in a way that will appeal to people there. 13 min: Concluding comments. Comment on &quot;500,000 More!” Encourage all to get good supply of books; remember last time &quot;Evolution” offered it went fast. May refer to &quot;Yearbook,” page 190, 113, on witnessing if time permits. Song 98.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Just Say</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Making disciples brings great joy, and it means that we are successfully following the example of Jesus Christ. In making disciples he carefully taught them so that they could teach others. Yet how refreshingly simple was his invitation to them to join him in the ministry. He said, “Come after me.” —Matt. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">4:</span><span class="font10">19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During April we are happy to give special attention to those ready to join with us in the ministry and, brothers, we have a wonderful potential for new praisers in the 247,957 Bible studies we averaged last year! Each of these studies represents at least one person who should have been steadily learning the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But how have we been teaching them to teach others? (2 Tim. 2:2) During the past five months, November through March, we have especially done this by helping our Bible students to appreciate the privilege of becoming praisers of Jehovah with the aid of the service meeting demonstrations “Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God.” Following this progressive, Scrip</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font9">♦ On Memorial evening announcement may be made that copies of the special April 15 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">are on hand, and everyone should be encouraged to take several copies to distribute to friends and relatives. ♦ The offer for June will be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font9"> with one booklet, on a $1 contribution. Check your stock now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ During May the offer will be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie*</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting, </span><span class="font9">along with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> book, on a contribution of 75 cents. One free booklet is given with each large book placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregations normally having service meetings on Friday nights may wish to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">go over</span><span class="font9"> Memorial arrangements the Sunday before Memorial or have book study servants handle these announcements following the book studies that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ A number of years ago the Society printed thousands of copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Prince of Peace</span><span class="font9"> booklet in Hungarian and more than 10,000 copies of the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font9"> in Hungarian. This was back in 1943, and we had hoped to get these into Hungary. The Iron Curtain stopped this movement. However, thousands of Hungarian people have left Hungary and nave moved into other parts of the world. The Society would be very pleased to have the brothers who know Hungarian-speaking people distribute these publications iree of charge among such persons. The Society will be glad to furnish congregations with as many free copies of these publications as the congregations feel they can use. They should be ordered with other literature by the congregation on the regular congregation literature order form. We would like to ship these out through the branch offices </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in the next three months</span><span class="font9"> to congregations so that the publications might be put into the hands of Hungarian-reading per-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">tural program with our students on why and how we serve as ministers has no doubt kindled a genuine desire in the hearts of many to have a share themselves in teaching others the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Our next step, then, Is to be sure they are ready for a share. Ask yourself the ten suggested questions on page 108 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot”</span><span class="font10"> regarding those new ones we are ready to invite into the ministry. Discuss each Scriptural requirement with your Bible students to be sure of their heart attitude toward Jehovah’s service. If these questions can be answered positively about our Bible students, then they are ready to begin teaching others. They may feel a little weak at first, but if they have right hearts and a willing spirit Jehovah will bless them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Having prepared them for the ministry, what should we then do? Simply say “Come,” as Jesus did. Be confident in Jehovah’s spirit to move them and simply invite them to share with you in the joyous work of making disciples. Just say “Come I”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">sons. These publications will be sent free along with other literature that the congregation orders, and the congregation in turn can give the publications away free of charge. We would appreciate your cooperation in getting these publications into the field.</span></p>

(Spanish also); Omaha, Neb.; Sacramento, Calif.; Toledo. Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JULY 11-14: Billings, Mont.: Detroit, Mich.; Pueblo, Col.; Rochester, N.Y.; St. Petersburg, Fla. (Spanish also); San Angelo. Tex.; Winston-Salem, N.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JULY 18-21: Minot. N.D.; Pawtucket, R.I.; San Bernardino, Calif. (Spanish also); Washington, D.C. (Spanish also)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JULY 25-28: Albuquerque. N.M. (Spanish also); Memphis, Tenn.; Muskegon, Mich.; Spokane, Wash.; Ventura, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AUGUST 1-4: Charleston. W. Va.; Greenville, S.C.: Tulsa, Okla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AUGUST 8-11: Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis, Ind.; Inglewood, Calif.; Santa Rosa, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AUGUST 15-18: Bakersfield, Calif.; Burlington, Vt.; Eureka, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Medford, Ore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Undoubtedly many will desire to attend the nearest assembly. However, in some of the large metropolitan areas, in order to balance the size of the crowd with the size of the facilities, certain recommendations below are made so the attendance will be better accommodated with the convention facilities. For example, while New York is slightly nearer to Pawtucket, R.I., than It is to Washington, D.C., it will be to the comfort of those from metropolitan New York if they can arrange to attend at Washington because of ample seating at the new large D.C. Stadium. In other areas It will be helpful if the circuits will attend the cities as listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">BAKERSFIELD, CALIF.: Calif. #33. BURLINGTON, VT.: N.Y. #14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">JACKSONVILLE, FLA.: Fla. #5, #9;</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It's Easy to Offer Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Generally it is easy to offer the magazines in our field ministry. This fact should encourage each of us to think about asking those with whom we conduct home Bible studies to accompany us in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When planning to take a new publisher into the field, the experienced publisher is wise to examine his own presentation and be sure it is simple and direct. To start him off, it may be wise to let him use an article title to arouse interest, coming to the point quickly and mentioning the small contribution of ten cents for two magazines. It is not necessary to mention articles in both magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For example, the special April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> contains an article on “What the Future Holds for</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> April is the final month of our thirtieth </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign. Will this campaign be the finest ever? Probably that will depend upon what we do in April. During the first three months of the campaign we met interested persons. Individual magazines were placed with many during the last few weeks. Now April is here, the time to call back on all interested people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Have we offered the subscriptions to those who take copies on our magazine routes? In Britain one pioneer doing this obtained 22 subscriptions in two days. An elderly pioneer got 69 subscriptions during the campaign. Are you enjoying such blessings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Are there any in your territory who read a foreign language? The March </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> suggested that we offer subscriptions to those people during April. Sometimes reading matter in their tongue is not plentiful and they will quickly subscribe if they see a publication in their language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Did someone express interest in the magazines but not have the contribution on hand? Call back now. Go over all House-to-House Records for the past three months and give every Interested person a chance to become a subscriber in April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">You.” One might say: “Good morning. I have information that will be of Interest to you. In this article, ‘What the Future Holds for You,’ your future is discussed. All of us have a choice as to the future. What you do now will definitely affect your future and perhaps the future of your family. I am sure you will enjoy reading this information. These two magazines are left for a contribution of only ten cents.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The special April 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">features “The Catholic Church in the Modern World.” This magazine can be used effectively for both Catholic and non-Catholic territory. Take into account the kind of people in your territory and choose a presentation that will appeal. NonCatholics take interest in current events, and what is happening in the Catholic church is in the news, so </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> ought to be easy to place. The last time we had a special issue on the Catholic church we broke all records to that date on magazine placements. Whatever presentation you select, be sure to keep it brief and to the point.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> April is a good month to get new publishers started in the service.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> tVe know the importance of meetings to keep one spiritually strong. Newly interested ones will gain spiritual benefits if we can get them to come back for other meetings.

<p><span class="font9">• What should you do when someone you meet in the ministry insists that you accept a contribution although he does not . want the literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At times it is evidence of a good heart condition when persons we meet in the ministry wish to contribute toward the advancement of the Kingdom preaching work, so this privilege should not be denied interested persons even though they may at that time have some personal reason for refusing the literature we offer. The queen of Sheba, although not one of God’s people at that time, was very impressed with the work Solomon was doing and Jehovah’s obvious blessing upon him, and so made a very large contribution that Solomon accepted.— 1 Ki. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When such a situation presents itself in our ministry, we need not think that it lowers our work to accept such a contribution. It would be good to make clear to the person first that our purpose in calling is not to solicit contributions, but to preach the Kingdom good news and to offer free home Bible studies. If, after this, he stili desires to make a contribution, although not wanting the literature, we may accept the contribution. Usually it is a small amount and we may say we plan to use it in giving publications to someone who is unable to make a contribution or that we will place it in the Kingdom Hall contribution box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In some instances there may be an opportunity to give a further witness explaining the Christian way of freewill, unannounced contributions as they are made at our Kingdom Halls by means of the contribution box; or how such contributions make possible our sending missionaries to all parts of the earth to preach the Kingdom message in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14. By our tactfully answering such persons in this way they will understand that we are not soliciting contributions, and we will not quench their willing spirit that could eventually lead to their learning the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 1968 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.'’—Mark 13:10. VOL. XI NO. 5</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark1"></a>‘TubWefcS:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Springtime is here! And longer days and a warmer sun mean that more of us can increase our share in planting, an appropriate activity for this time of year. Our Kingdom ministry does involve a diligent planting of the seeds of truth, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Already, though, you have all been engaged in a great deal of preliminary work, yes, and even some planting, for during the months of January, February and March the reports for the United States show 466,617 new subscriptions. This is truly marvelous! So we are all going to be very busy both in planting additional seed and in cultivating what has already been sown. That’s where our Bible study activity comes in. It is a wonderful way of cultivating strong faith in God and in his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Just as the farmer may build up reproductive soil by sowing some special type of seed, so, during the month of May, we ean all share in giving wide distribution to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book to reach certain types of people. With this fine publication don’t you think we will be able to gain the attention of many who have little interest in the Bible? When they see the evolution theory in its true light, they may have more respect for God’s Word. So, brothers, we are going to have a joyous time during May offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book along with other publications throughout our territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In May, too, we ought to think about plans for the summer and attendance at one of the assemblies. Which one will you attend? Have you decided yet? And how many of the newer ones are you encouraging to go along with you to share the bountiful spiritual feast in association with great crowds of our happy brothers and sisters? It is time to give thought to such matters. A thrilling program is being prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On Monday, April 22, the new Gilead class started. Here at Bethel</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Ourselves Thankful</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Thanks be to God!” How often the apostle Paul used that expression. And we have so many things for which to be thankful, don’t we? Our theme for May reminds us to advocate Christ’s blood for mankind’s salvation. With full appreciation to Jehovah for sending his dear Son in our behalf, our love wells up and we want to express our thanks to God for the gift of his Son and publish the knowledge of him in every place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> A fine opportunity is open to us in May to spread this knowledge of God in every place. How? Well, we have both a special work and a general work to do. What is the “special” work? It is one we started in November, that is, to call on all educators with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book. In November, the demand for tilts publication was just more than any of us expected. Now, in May, we have plenty of books and our goal will be to get a copy of this fine we were reminded of this two weeks earlier, after our Monday-night family </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study. A group of students who were already on hand for the next class of Gilead introduced themselves to the Bethel family and told us some fine experiences they had in their respective homelands. From Denmark, England, Germany and Turkey they have come to receive missionary training. We love them for their deep devotion to Jehovah and the Kingdom interests, and we will enjoy our association with them here at Bethel for the next five months.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">May is an Invigorating month. Let’s use our renewed vigor in the planting of fine seed, for if we plant we shall also reap. May Jehovah’s rich blessing prosper all of us as we advocate Christ’s blood as the sole means of salvation for humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">publication into the hands of every educator and anyone else too in our community who will accept it. Your overseer will be organizing this special work, and you are invited to cooperate with him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some have received copies already, affording good opportunities to return and get their comments. Remember, studies can be started in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book, too. It may be just what is needed to help some over the subtle obstacles that the Devil has raised to crowd out faith in God and belief in his way to salvation through Christ Jesus. You can make up your own questions and choose additional scriptures to bring in as you see the need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> But are teachers the only ones who need this publication ? No! Here’s where our “general” work comes in. Others also need the right understanding of how man got here, so honor might go to the ‘One who created rather than to the creation.’ (Rom. 1: 25) The suggested sermon, “God Is Alive!” will be helpful as we go from house to house with the offer. If you prefer to use another sermon, this will be all right. The important thing is to prepare something fitting ahead of time and call attention to the features of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book. Read through the insert of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> this month and we are sure the experiences of others in placing this book will give you many talking points and suggest opportunities for placing it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> While you likely will be featuring the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book often in your house-to-house presentations, you may also feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font13"> or the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font13"> books. The full offer is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book along with either of the other two, and one booklet, for 75c. In some territories you may find it best, in giving the sermon “God Is Alive!” to make reference to some outstanding point in Chapter One of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">True to his promise, Jehovah has certainly added the increase, as is evident from our March report. With 325,779 publishers reporting in the best March so far, the result has been a 4.6-percent increase over last year’s average. In fact, we missed coming up to April’s peak of a year ago by only about 3,000 publishers. What a fine build-up for April’s special activity, when we hope many more new ones will join us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There were new peaks In back-calls and Bible studies, too! Just Imagine 2,350,801 return calls and 291,850 studies conducted in one month, resulting in the fin^ averages of 5.3 and .7 respectively for congregation publishers. You will recall that last year’s subscription campaign was excellent. Now this year, by the end of March, we are 35,054 subscriptions ahead of last year. Magazine placements are again back above 12 per publisher, and this is very fine. An excellent report in every respect, reflecting Jehovah’s rich blessing.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE &quot;EVOLUTION&quot; BOOK-FOR DRAGNET FISH®'</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">66TT IS like a dragnet, and we are ‘catching </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font0"> men alive.’ ” So one circuit servant described the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font0"> And how true that is! This book is a most valuable part of our fishing equipment, for, as a district servant has remarked, “we find that it appeals to everyone, young or old, believer or unbeliever.” And a publisher exclaimed: “It is so simple and readable that anybody’s grandmother will be able to read and grasp its message!” Yes, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book is like a dragnet itself, aiding us to gather in all kinds of people.—Matt. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During May we will be working with this book again, along with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie’ </span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font0"> book; so we do well to review the astonishing experiences of the November campaign. This will give you ideas on what to do, during May, to let your nets down in all waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the month of November the Society received more than 110 telegrams and over 200 long-distance phone calls. “Rush nore books,” was the gist of these communi-—cations. Some congregations ordered two or three times, and one congregation ordered 1,350 books during November alone. Because of the urgent demand the bindery, during that month, produced 403,605 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font0">books. The Society had a small supply on hand at the beginning of the month, but you publishers ordered a total of 432,216 books during November. This means that your orders were 10,192 copies ahead of our supply —the first time that the demand has kept ahead of the Society’s bindery for a whole month! And this is, by far, the largest shipment to you publishers of any one book during one month!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Book Has Wide Appeal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">From every part of the land came telegrams and rush orders. Here are a few excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alabama: “We’ve never had a book go so fast!” “They went almost as fast as we could hand them out.” California: “They’re going so fast we have not made a dent in the demand. Publishers ask for 10 copies at a time.” “It is November 3 and we are in urgent need of more.” “All we have to do is show the book and they take it.” “The response is unbelievable.” Georgia: “Publishers rejoicing in using new book. Supply exhausted, month only half through.” “We thought that in this Baptist community it would not go well, but '' we were out the first few days.” Louisiana: “Books went like hot cakes. This is second day of campaign, and we are out.” “Original order of 475 books placed. Rush shipment of 570.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Maine: “28 publishers in 2 hours placed 74 books! Two ten-year-olds placed 3 each.” Massachusetts: “Rush more. They are going like a storm!” Michigan: “Many who previously refused to accept any literature are readily taking the book.” “Readily accepted in Catholic territory!” “Publishers placing 2 and 3 books every time they go out and we don’t have one left.” Mississippi: “Supply exhausted first 4 days of campaign. Please ship 380 copies fastest way.” New Mexico: “Send more. The acceptance has been much better than anticipated!” North Carolina: “We thought we had ordered enough but they are all gone.” Ohio: “All our books have been taken by the publishers.” Oklahoma: “Literature has been hard to place here, but we have placed every book we had in stock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oregon: “First shipment went out so fast we can hardly believe it.” South Carolina: “No trouble placing book. The trouble is keeping in supply.” Tennessee: “We thought we ordered enough but we were wrong.” Texas: “Out of books on the 5th; you sent a case the 11th; out again on the 14th; you sent another case the 16th. We are almost out again on the 22nd.” “People are impressed by the low price and size of the book; once they see it they readily take a copy. All four congregations here have about run out of supply.” Washington, D.C.: “We ordered 190 books for 120 publishers. They were all taken by the 5th. We sent an extra order for 285 more. They arrived on the 9th. Today is the 12th and our shelves are almost empty again. It appears this congregation servant does not know how to order. I apologize.” West Virginia: “The public has given this book unprecedented acceptance.” “We just received our second shipment. In first five days of campaign we are out again. Rush more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The situation was well summed up by a district servant: “Practically all congregations spent most of the month trying to borrow books from other congregations. Very few had any books for any length of time.” Seldom have books been rationed in so many congregations as during November.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Publishers and Public Enthusiastic</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Many of you publishers have written expressing delight over this book. Typical is this expression: “The simplicity and logic is devastating! To be able to deal with a subject that is usually couched in language way over the average person’s head is very remarkable. Just the illustrations convey the point. I get the feel that the book just places itself. In a busy society something simple, easy to read, not too big, well illustrated and ‘just a quarter’—well, people will spend that much on the Sunday paper and think nothing of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here are a few more comments from the field: “The finest treatise ever written on this subject.” “A vital component in the Christian minister’s fishing equipment that should be carried at all times.” “Wonderful to present.” “Never fails to get attention!” “Easiest book to place we have ever featured.” “In my many years in the truth, I have never seen such enthusiasm over the distribution of a book.” “The book tolls the requiem of this comic swindle called ‘evolution.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But that this book is truly effective in our service of ‘catching men alive’ may be noted from the enthusiasm by which it is being greeted among the public. A newspaper editor and higher critic said: “It’s the most scientific discussion of evolution from the Bible’s standpoint I have ever read. I’ve read a lot of books purporting to refute evolution but this is the first to do a good job of it.” A man in North Carolina wrote: “I just completed your book and it reversed my entire attitude toward God and life. I have been much of a ‘spiritualist.’ I believed in an Almighty Being, but not in the Bible. Now suddenly, my eyes have been opened.” This same person also ordered, as many have done, a copy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An amazing thing is that people who have been refusing our literature for years often take a copy of this book. Catholics who turn down “anything religious” gladly accept the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book as soon as its scientific aspects are mentioned. Opposed relatives in large numbers have accepted a copy. Wives, not anxious to have the book personally, will often take a copy for husband or student son. One said: “I’d like to get that book for my husband; he is an engineer.” Doctors’ wives often took a copy. One lady took it saying that her husband would probably be angry if she passed up the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So enthusiastic have some of the public become that they are undertaking to share in the distribution. Many businessmen and householders are passing them on to relatives and ordering more for themselves. Some have even asked if they could join in the distribution. In North Carolina a young couple received their copy from a man who is a Pentecostal. And they came into the truth! Yes, as another district servant put it: “It is amazing to all the brothers how much enthusiasm the public has shown with regard to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Students Eager</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Among those who have shown outstanding interest are students of all kinds. A young man, just graduated from college, wrote: “Not only have I read that fantastic book, but also have gotten over a state of speechless shock, which I felt coming on stronger and stronger as I progressed through the book. The book is so thoroughly documented! It has certainly changed my opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One pioneer placed 200 copies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font0">last November, 100 of them with students! Many have found that in homes where there are youths of school age it is easy to place the book. And young publishers have placed many copies right in school. One reports: “One day I placed 9 books in one classroom. The next day I placed one with a boy who never had talked to Witnesses before. He stayed up all night to read it and later said: ‘I’ll take five of them!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A twelve-year-old says: “My teacher read some of the book and the next day recommended it to the class. Thus I was able to place 34 copies.” And a college student from India who firmly believed in evolution explained that he “went to the college library and checked out all the references,” and has now changed his mind; he wants to learn more about the Bible!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Educating the Educators</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">During May we will try to reach as many educators as we can so as to offer them the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book. Last November a fine start was made in this feature of our fishing operation. In Arizona a teacher told a young publisher: “All the biology teachers have seen those books floating around school, and they are just wild about them. They would like to get some if you have any left.” A biology professor said he wished he could throw away his present textbook and teach from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A publisher in California noted that a few days after placing the book with his teacher half the questions on a test were from the book, one of them being, “According to the Bible, how long has man been on earth?” In Georgia, one publisher who placed many with .leachers said: “When I asked how much they thought a book like this would cost, they would invariably say, ‘About two dollars.’ They eagerly accepted a copy for 25 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many colleges were called on last November. In fact, one pioneer placed 40 with a professor who intended to use them in his biology classes. In several instances professors ordered from one to two dozen copies. One science professor in South Dakota wrote about his delight: “I have fought evolution for 30 years; 25 years to convince myself, and 5 years trying to convince others.” An anthropology teacher wrote: “One of my students brought me a copy and I found it so well produced and documented that I would like to make use of it in my teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Principals and school presidents have responded well. One principal in a California school took 12 copies. In Michigan a woman principal asked for 20 copies. And she was a nun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Tennessee, a publisher who had good success placing copies with school principals simply told them that “we are making a special effort to make this fine book available to all principals and teachers.” If the principal took one, the publisher would say: “Would you please give me permission to approach each teacher and present the book to them also?” Of course, he assured the principal that it would take but one minute for each call. “In each case,” he reported, “I was granted permission, and over half the teachers took a copy. In one case the principal insisted on giving me a written list of all teachers, and as I met each one I would check off my list.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many publishers also reported leaving </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> books in college libraries, where there were hundreds of books supporting evolution, but a dearth of those giving the other side of the question. “Fishing&quot; in college towns with this new book has been most successful, and we can surely anticipate even greater catches during our May campaign.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Many Ways You Placed It</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Now, it should be helpful to consider some of the .ways you went about placing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book during November. In house-to-house work many found a simple presentation effective. “Even children are able to share in this inasmuch as it is so simple and easy,” says one report from the field. Some found it helpful to start in with Genesis 2:7 and then ask: “Now, is this correct, or, is what is being taught in school correct? Children are being taught evolution as though it were established fact. Do you think it is, or do you agree with the Bible? As parents we need to know the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Displaying the book’s features often resulted in its placement. For example, the foreword on page 2 shows parents that children are being taught evolution. Professional people have responded favorably to the list of references. An Alabama publisher who called on 13 principals said that the reception was invariably good, and that he introduced the book by showing the table of contents as well as the reference list. “This proved to be very successful,” he reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The illustrations alone can be credited with many of the placements. One publisher wrote: “I always show the diagram on page 118, explaining the miracle of human birth, which attests to the wisdom of God, and people of all ages want to read the material.” A district servant says: ‘‘We have found the easiest way to demonstrate the book is simply to explain a few of the many pictures. Then the book places itself.” Others have used the illustration on page 4 and asked: “Just where do you think we came from?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Older people, it was noted, could be quickly interested through the chapter on “Why Has Wickedness Been Permitted for So Long?” and a brief reference to the concluding chapter on “A Marvelous Future.” Farmers, too, often reacted favorably to this approach. A circuit servant wrote to say: “Here in the ‘Bible Belt’ it is advisable to make it very clear that the book does not uphold evolution.” One successful publisher reported: “I told people that since they believed in the Bible account of creation they had the obligation to defend their faith, and that this book would furnish the needed ammunition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even when ill or too busy, householders can often stop long enough to hear the brief offer. A publisher reports saying in such cases: “I won’t keep you but I would like to leave you a copy of this book that answers this question [holding up the book so the title can be seen]. Is is left for 25 cents.” One elderly sister would simply give a friendly greeting, hold up the book, and ask, “What do you think?” She placed 70 books during November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In magazine work, too, the book went well in conjunction with two magazines for 35 cents. A district servant readily placed this offer in three out of four houses called on. In fact, it was reported that people who turned down magazines would accept the book. Other publishers found it good to carry extra copies of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book during magazine work, so that when householders contributed generously the book would be offered as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine routes also proved to be a fine setting for the placement of many books. One publisher reports placing 40 books during the month as a result of combining the book with the offer of magazines. A Texas brother writes: “My wife placed 25 books in two days on magazine deliveries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Store-to-store work also offered a fine avenue for book placements. “Businessmen were surprised at how reasonable the cost was, and they were unusually interested in the subject,” recounted one publisher. In Texas four publishers worked one main street and placed 35 books and 70 magazines within four hours. It was not uncommon for storekeepers to accept the books on the basis of four for $1. Barber shops were specially productive as “fishing grounds,” patrons as well as barbers wanting copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Back-call work and street work also offered many opportunities. In Wyoming one congregation placed 90 books on back-calls during November. And here in the vicinity of Bethel three of our brothers engaged in street work for a few hours on two Saturdays and placed a total of 36 books. They tactfully approached people and said: “Here is a very controversial publication, but you will find it most absorbing. It explains how we got here, where we are going, and what the future holds. It is only 25 cents.” And a district servant says: “The book can be placed as readily as magazines by just approaching people in parked cars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The book can also be offered successfully to all kinds of delivery salesmen, whether met at your own door or on the street. Even where you come across a group of youths it may well be worth while to ‘let down your net for a catch.’ One publisher who has been successful in this field says: “It is advisable to place a copy of the publication in each youth’s hand and then give the sermon. Most of them will want a copy.” A Witness, invited to speak to a church youth group, reported: “There were seventeen young persons present and three couples. We placed 17 of the books and 44 magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, brothers, you did a splendid job in November, but that was just a start. Now we have marvelous new opportunities ahead of us during May. Be prepared to use the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font0"> books in a successful season of dragnet fishing. Let us, by our enthusiasm and vigor, capture the interest of the people through the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font0"> book, and then we can gradually bring home to them Jehovah’s provision for them to obtain salvation through the gift of Christ’s atoning blood.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> During March and April many new ones have responded to your loving efforts to help them share in the ministry. Will they continue? They have taken their first steps, as it were, in the ministry, but you know your help is still very much needed if they are to walk with steadiness in Jehovah’s service. How vital it is to keep building appreciation and desire to share in the service as you hold your studies with them each week! As we go into May, make appointments to take them with you into the field and in advance go over simple presentations that they might use. Invite them on other calls, and as you see that they want to share in the conversation, encourage this. Direct matters toward having a joyful time in the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As you progressively instruct a new praiser of Jehovah, do you know what is happening in addition? You are helping him to build good service habits. What does he learn? One important thing is scheduling time regularly for the ministry. When the time comes to go in the service, that’s what he wants to do. Another is the need for preparation before going into the service, so as to have something definite to say and to have the publications and equipment needed. Still another 'hing is the proper way to work erritory, keeping a record of inter-</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The offer. May: Evolution book with either Life </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting</span><span class="font12"> or 'Impossible to Lie’ book, and a booklet, for 75c. June: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New world Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> and a booklet, for $1. (Complete Bible in English, Spanish and Italian will be available for campaign. Copies of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> in Dutch. French, German, Italian and Portuguese may be offered for 50c.) July to September: Offer the latest bound book. You may offer Life </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting</span><span class="font12"> book, and a booklet, for 50c, or this book and ‘Impossible to Lie’ book, with two booklets, for $1. You may also combine Evolution book with either for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Many will not be working secularly May 30, &quot;Memorial Day.&quot; We suggest that congregations make special arrangements for working with regular offer, featuring the Evolution book. ♦ Lapel cards in English and Spanish for use at the district assemblies may be ordered by overseers. The cost is 1c each. None will be available at the assembly book counters. Holders for these may be ordered at the same time at 5c each. Bumper signs will not be provided for this series of assemblies. ♦ Before service meeting for week of May 5 overseers should plan the arrangements for introducing </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font12">book to all teachers in the congregation’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Regular pioneers who desire to serve as special pioneers in unassigned ter-</span><span class="font13">ested ones and not-at-homes so as to call back. Of course, you do not teach him all of these things the first time you go out; but each time there is “on-the-job training’’ there are things to learn and experience to be gained so that in a relatively short time the new publisher becomes an experienced teacher of Jehovah’s Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> But besides the new ones in our midst, others who have been associated for more than a short time need loving assistance in order to be regular praisers of Jehovah. Discouragement, becoming overly involved in the affairs of this world, sickness or other circumstances may have interfered greatly with their service schedules. Can we help our weaker brothers and sisters, in line with the confidence-inspiring words at Isaiah 35: 3, 4? Maybe all some need is your encouragement and going with them to a few doors so as to get back into practice again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> So, help them continue to praise Jehovah, whether new in the ministry or just a little weak even after being active for a while. “We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. Let each of us please bls neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.”—Rom. 15:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparing to Attend the Assemblies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> All of us who are physically able are doubtless making plans to attend one of the district assemblies this summer. Already we have received inklings that the program right from the start will be filled with spiritual instruction and surprises. Our plans should include being present all four days. But there is something more that we need to give attention, if we are to be a real credit to Jehovah and his organization, and that is our conduct and dress at the assembly city. Why not sit down as a family before the assembly and review these matters? Discuss proper conduct—considerateness in waiting to be served at counters, being in your seats when the program starts, not moving about through the hallways or talking during sessions, keeping litter off the grounds and respecting the property of those living near the assembly site. Talk over, too, the matter of clothing—neatness, cleanness and propriety. To help you in this discussion, fine material can be found in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1968 Yearbook, </span><span class="font13">page 49, and in the article “Why Are They So Messy?” in the November 8, 196G, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Parents, by talking over these things and by making arrangements to be </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">together as a family,</span><span class="font13"> especially those with young children and teen-agers, all will enjoy the assembly much more. It is good to have your sons and daughters with you. (Deut. 16:11, 14) There is much in the program especially designed for the young people to help them face an unruly, rebellious world. Most of the younger ones have displayed fine conduct at our assemblies. This is commendable and speaks well of parental training. Often young persons do a good share of the assembly work too, and this is greatly appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup>This brings us to a vital need: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">volunteer help.</span><span class="font13"> At some assemblies last year there were not enough to take care of the many departments. As attendance grows, many more workers are required to take care of the crowds. Can you volunteer at this assembly? Many willing hands get the vast amount of work done so all might fully enjoy and benefit from the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that we are at the assembly as guests and that Jehovah is our Host, welcoming us. The people of the city also view us as guests on their property and they watch us closely. We want to glorify God in the name that we bear as witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To educators and students by means of the “Evolution&quot; book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Whether we are students approaching our teachers, or grownups calling on teachers and professors, we want to make the most effective approach that we can, doing so at appropriate times. First, we must keep in mind that we represent the Creator of the universe, the greatest Scientist. This will give us confidence and freeness of speech. Teachers have generally been required to teach what is in the textbooks, which have presented evolution as a fact. But they do not have proof of it and have difficulty in giving clear answers to the many questions that arise. A good teacher likes to have reasons and to be able to answer questions, and to base his answers on a solid foundation. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book provides this and quotes from authorities with whom teachers are familiar and whom they will accept. So it is a privilege to bring this information to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> If you are a student you might say, “Good morning, [name], I have been interested in things that have been said in our biology [or science or history] class about man’s origin.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Ourselves Thankful </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) ‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font13"> book. If the full offer is not accepted, invite them to accept the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book for 25c.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Some may tell you frankly that they do not believe in evolution. That’s fine. Commend them. There are, nevertheless, perplexing questions, such as why God placed man on the earth and w<sup>r</sup>hy wickedness exists on the earth. The book gives satisfying answers to these questions from the Bible. Moreover, as to believing evolution to be false, could they prove it? Those who still have respect for the Bible will be Interested in the scientific and especially the Scriptural reasons why evolution could not be true.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> “I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord ... because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry.” (1 Tim. 1:12) Do you feel as did Paul regarding your ministry? We are sure you do and that you will help many more during May to be thankful for the graciousness of Jehovah through his Son. I have been reading this book that presents the most reasonable viewpoint I have found on the subject, and it covers practically all branches of science dealing with the matter. The cost of the book is only 25c.&quot; Handing it to the teacher, you could direct him to the publisher’s note and the table of contents on the opposite page. A very similar approach might be made to a fellow student Or you might ask the student a question as to what he thinks about something said in class or some statement in a textbook about evolution; then show him a point in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A parent has an excellent opportunity to call on teachers and principals to get acquainted and to lead Into the presentation. Or a more direct approach might be: “I am Mrs. Roberts, Johnny’s mother. Naturally I am interested in his schooling, and I have noticed when helping him with his homework that the subject of evolution often comes up. For that reason I was so happy to get this book that deals so well with the subject from the viewpoint of scientists and treats the question so clearly. For instance, this chapter on Heredity [page 69] describes the marvelous discoveries about the DNA molecules and how it forms a ‘blueprint’ for heredity.” Or some other chapter of special interest to you may be presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> After seeing so much uncertainty and confusion among fellow teachers and students, college professors and teachers are often impressed by the confidence and good appearance of Jehovah’s witnesses. (Matt. 7:29) An approach to a college teacher might be: &quot;Good morning, Mr._____.. I am Mr._________</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">I'm making a special call on educators in this area to present this book. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font13"> Its purpose is to give a fair discussion of the question, by reference to statements of leading scientists. It is offered at cost of publication, only 25c.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Secretaries, assistants and others may also be offered the book, and the above presentations can be easily adapted for door-to-door or back-call work.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Question d^ox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">• Is it wise for Jehovah's witnesses to organize large Saturday-night socials or dance parties among themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No, it is not a wise thing to do, though it is reported that this has been done in some places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What takes place on such occasions? There usually is no program of upbuilding Bible discussion; that is not why they are organized. Rather, the objective usually is to have a &quot;good time&quot;—that is, the kind of &quot;good time” that the world has. So, invitations to these events have announced that there will be bands and dancing. Some of the band members or others present have been undedicated or immature persons. They encouraged the kind of music and dancing that are popular among worldly people. Not having completely made over their minds, they did not fully sense the godly obligation to restrain their emotions. And such throwing off of restraint all too easily leads to further unchristian conduct. It is wise to remember that the Bible cautions us, not only that we should not love the association of worldly people, but also that we should not be loving &quot;the things in the world.&quot; (1 John 2:16) Are we heeding that advice when we imitate worldly ways in our recreation? Certainly not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is a fine thing to invite one's fellow Christians to one’s home, but there is a big difference between such Christian hospitality and selling admission tickets to them for a party. When you invite others to be your guests, wisely be sure that the size of the group is such that you can really take full responsibility for what is done. And in planning what you will do. keep in mind the advice to &quot;pursue the things . . . that are upbuilding to one another.&quot;—Rom. 14:19.</span></p>

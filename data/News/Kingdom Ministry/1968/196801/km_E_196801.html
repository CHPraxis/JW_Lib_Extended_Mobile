<p><span class="font9">By this time we hope you have received your new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> and calendar. We here at Bethel have started to read it at the breakfast table, and we are certainly enjoying it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Have you heard that in Nicaragua one brother gathers his neighbors together—up to twenty-four of them—for the text discussion each morning? And in Liberia some brothers meet daily at 4:30 a.m., before going to work, to discuss the text and read experiences. Then when they return home later in the day they share with their families what they learned. They really do appreciate the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What interesting and encouraging reports there are in our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> for 1968! Have you read how the cruel persecution of our brothers in the United Arab Republic helped an interested person to accept the truth? and about the opposed husband in Belgium who was so impressed by the kindness of the brothers in trying to return even a lost button at a circuit assembly that he began to study the truth? These are just a few of the fine experiences in your new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And what about the calendar? Isn't that an impressive picture? it will surely keep us alert to the fact that “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” And we believe that you will be glad to have that large calendar pad for making note of forthcoming theocratic events and responsibilities, such as school assignments, back-call appointments, circuit servant visits and assembly dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Didn't we all have a fine time with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> book during November? We know from your letters and reports that you placed large numbers of them, and it certainly kept us busy here filling your orders. It was a joy to serve you, and it made us happy to see the response to this fine publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now 1968 is upon us. It is time for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font9"> campaign, and we are sure that you will enjoy</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;THE WATCHTOWER&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Has Good News for the People!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">'THE WATCHTOWER!</span><span class="font9"> More and more people are reading it because it is giving them the Scriptural information they want and need. Last year 127,531,779 copies were printed for distribution world wide. In the United States alone 653,248 new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscriptions were obtained during the year. At least 5,050,000 copies of the January 1 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">are being printed in 74 languages. And what is in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower! </span><span class="font9">Good news for the people! The answers to their many questions about world conditions and the Scriptural remedy to their personal problems, together with other Scriptural information they need. How glad we are to have it to share with others!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Beginning this month, we will be offering subscriptions for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> with three booklets, for .$1. As you contact people from house to house, you may find it effective to consider briefly with them some of the local problems that families and individuals in their neighborhood face, or the increasing tension over world conditions. Then you can assure them that there is a remedy to their problems and there are answers to their questions. They are in the Bible, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will help them to find them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Many of you have been making a practice of offering double subscriptions and you have had good success. You will be glad to know that the January 8 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">will feature a consideration of &quot;The distributing the fine material that has been prepared to help others to see the truth and get out of Babylon the Great while there is yet time. May Jehovah continue to bless all of you as you push on In his work despite physical weaknesses, giving evidence of your spiritual strength.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Increase of Lawlessness&quot; with practical suggestions on how individuals can protect themselves now and also information concerning Jehovah's guarantee of a permanent remedy for these conditions. This issue, together with the January Issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and their/articles on &quot;Where Can You Find Security?” and “Security That Even Money Cannot Buy,” will make a good combination for offering double subscriptions, and they go well with the new sermon on security.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> During the campaign we will be busy offering subscriptions to all we meet from house to house. This should be a regular part of our activity. But, above all others, we would like to see our close friends, relatives and neighbors learn the truth, wouldn’t we? Why not make It a point to offer them subscriptions in January? While discussing your daily activities with them, you may feel it appropriate in some cases to come right to the point and tell them: ‘This month we are offering </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">to everybody in town, and I would like very much to have you receive them too. Why not accept the subscriptions for a year and see what they say? They are just $2.’ Some may accept your offer. Or, you may wish to give them a gift of the subscriptions. It is up to you to decide.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If the weather in January Is severe, you may find yourself confined to the house on some days and you may wish to do some of your witnessing to friends and relatives by writing letters. After telling what you and the family have been doing in the witness work and at meetings, you may wish to present matters as suggested above. Whether you make the offer by letter or in person, we suggest that you make the subscriptions available to all those whom you would like to have as close friends—people in your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font9"> 7, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font9"> 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Preaching and Enduring with Everlasting Life in View. Song 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.” Using the same method that is employed in conducting the “Watchtower” study, cover pages 208 through 211 Hl. The one assigned the part should prepare study questions for each paragraph. Bring the scriptures into the discussion. Have paragraphs read. In conclusion encourage all to study page 211 112 through page 215 Hl for consideration next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">22 min: “ ‘The Watchtower' Has Good News for the People!” Questions and answers. Concentrate on paragraphs 1-6; paragraphs 7-10 can be covered very quickly. Briefly demonstrate offer of subscriptions to friends, neighbors or relatives. Call on sister to read a paragraph or two of a letter she would write to a friend or a relative regarding subscriptions. Also call on audience for other suggestions for offering subscriptions to friends or relatives. (For helpful points that may be taken into consideration, see also “The Watchtower,” August 1, 1965, pages 456-460.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">3 min: Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate Theocratic News items and announcements. Song 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Enduring in Jehovah’s Service. Song 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.” Cover page 211 1J2 through page 215 fll. Use the same method as was employed on the previous service meeting. Perhaps the same brother can handle it. Encourage the congregation to study carefully the rest of the chapter for consideration next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">17 min: Talk on 1968 yeartext, based on material in introductory portion of “1968 Yearbook.” Suggest that publishers spend a few minutes discussing this material with their Bible students. Encourage energetic ministry in offering “Watchtower” subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God. (Demonstration of simple sermon.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having discussed the Scriptural basis for our preaching work, we might next give those with whom we study a practical demonstration of how we go about it. Keep it simple so they will feel that they could do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Demonstrate: At close of study, publisher mentions former discussions about preaching work, says that he was out making calls on others earlier that week. Suggests that householder might be interested in what we do on those calls. Asks one of them to play role of householder; publisher will demonstrate call. Use simplified sermon: Brief comment on bad conditions in world, lack of security. Read Proverbs 1:33, showing that those who listen to wisdom of God enjoy security. “Watchtower” helps people to get understanding of that wisdom of God, found in Bible; only $1 a year. Householder pleased with simplicity of it. Publisher suggests that they try it on friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Remind publishers, too, about offering subscriptions to friends, neighbors and relatives as well as others. Encourage steady house-to-house work. Report on new subscriptions turned In up to this date. Song 119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Helping Ourselves and Others to Stay Strong In the Truth. Song 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Introduction, text, comments. Discuss how many are at meetings and how many more might attend meetings. Encourage publishers to do good to those related to them in the faith by telling those who are not there what happened at meetings so they do not miss out on the good things presented. (Gal. 6:10) Also invite and help others to get to meetings where this would be helpful. Phone calls, letters and personal visits show kindly interest in our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Demonstrate publisher calling at home of another who missed meeting. Deliver “Kingdom Ministry.” Read Branch letter together. Enthusiastically discuss it and another point or two from one of your preceding meetings. Encourage publisher to read “Yearbook” experiences regularly with other members of family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot,” page 215 1i2 through page 219. Handle as outlined in second meeting in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “Presenting the Good News. Did You Find Them All?” Relate practical suggestions In article. Also, present experiences, local experiences or those from “1968 Yearbook,” showing good results of thoroughly covering territory. Encourage this during the “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. Draw attention to theme for month. Doesn’t it make you thankful to Jehovah that he has provided for us so richly in a spiritual way? Though many of us may not have the measure of health and strength we may wish, how blessed we have been to be made powerful spiritually and to be able to have good news to share with others! How much we have learned with the aid of Jehovah’s organization and “The Watchtower,” and now we have something good to share with others. Report also on subscriptions to date. Encourage all to bring &quot;Life Everlasting” book with them next week. Song 74.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Content to Be God’s Servants Full Time. Song 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Introduction, text, comments and talk on month’s theme. See “Watchtower,” February 1, 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “The 'Life Everlasting’ Book —What a Blessing!” See “Kingdom Ministry&quot; insert. Use variety in presentation, with some audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(10 min.) Draw attention to a point or two under the headings “Some Have Asked” and “Discussed at Bethel.” Ask audience about illustrations; also other points, if you wish. On page 326, why is Ham illustrated with darker skin? On page 251, what is the small box with a slit in the top? Who is the apostle next to the box? On page 135, why is there an empty place at the table?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(10 min.) Discuss the value to us and interested ones of the material in the chapters on 'God’s Neutral Congregation,’ 'Blood,* ‘Marriage’ and how our respect for civil authority and heaven’s wav of ruling benefits us. Encourage all to finish reading book, If they nave not yet done so. arid to attend congregation book study as we study it a second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Preparing Others to Become Praisers of God. (Demonstration of magazine presentation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How did you make out with that simplified sermon demonstration at your home Bible study? (Get a few comments from audience.) Here is our next step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Demonstrate: At close of study, publisher explains that we have variety of forms of service, thus reaching persons of different kinds with Kingdom message. One form that is very simple is house-to-house magazine work. Use one of persons with whom study is being conducted as householder. Offer two magazines for 10c, but highlight “Watchtower” article on security. Keep it brief, simple. Might suggest that newly interested ones try it in talking to friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 mln: Many Possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(1 min.) Chairman gives number of subscriptions thus far obtained and encourages all to obtain additional, concentrating during February on those who have shown an interest in the truth. Let’s watch two publishers who are making plans to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 mln.) Two publishers talk together as they make lists of those whom they know that have shown an interest in the truth. First they list the people with whom they are conducting studies. Reference is made to demonstration above and that Bible students might offer subscriptions to their friends and relatives. People who regularly obtain magazines are mentioned, and one publisher writes down names of three families on magazine route. One recalls an interested woman who has repeatedly declined offer for a Bible study, but always seems to take new literature when it is presented. Another recalls a family who used to study with Witnesses, but now has discontinued the study, etc. Both publishers express delight at having made a list of subscription prospects. They express confidence that, because these people have already shown interest in the truth, it is likely that some of them will be glad to obtain subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Summarize points above. Then comment on our desire to help those who have become inactive or used to come to Kingdom Hall or share in field service. They might be built up greatly in a spiritual way by receiving “The Watchtower” regularly and reading it. What can we say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 min.) Bible study servant and a book study servant discuss what can be said when offering subscriptions to inactive ones and others who used to come to meetings or share in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 mln.) Encourage all in congregation to feel free to make friendly calls on those we know in these circumstances. Offer subscriptions. Additionally, be prepared to study the Bible with them if they are agreeable. We want to help them regain spirituality if possible. Discuss, too, article “Do You Renew?” Though we do not include renewals on our service report, it is Important to give them attention. 10 min: Concluding comments. Also read and discuss Question Box with audience. Song 78.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE &quot;LIFE EVERLASTING&quot; BOOK</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>—What a Blessing!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Does it seem as if we’ve had the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font10"> book for about a year and a half now? Yes, most of us have had copies since the summer of 1966. How time flies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You haven’t just left the book unopened, though. One way we know that to be true is that some brothers have written us, asking questions about points in the book. Maybe you’ve wondered about the same things. Would you like to know the answers? Well, let’s consider a few of your questions, and at the same time share with you some of the comments made by brothers here at Bethel when we discussed new and interesting points in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Some Have Asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did you notice on page 90 the comment that if Joseph paid the five shekels to redeem the babe Jesus, then he became the legal father of Jesus? Did it mean that Jehovah no longer was Jesus’ true father? No, not at all. Remember, at Jesus’ baptism Jehovah said: “You are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font10"> Son.” (Luke 3:22) So the Almighty remained Jesus’ father. Yet, we thought you’d be interested in a statement made in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Jewish Encyclopedia.</span><span class="font10"> It observed: “Every Israelite is obliged to redeem </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font10"> first-born son thirty days after the latter’s birth. The mother is exempt from this obligation.” (Vol. 5, page 396) (Num. 18:15, 16) Consequently, if the Law was carried out in Jesus’ case, and probably it was even though the Bible does not mention it, Joseph had to pay the five shekels, not Mary. When he paid it, he assumed legal responsibility for the child that his wife had borne. While. Jehovah continued as Jesus’ true father, Joseph became Jesus’ earthly foster father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you look up all the texts cited but not quoted as you study each paragraph? Many brothers do, and they are blessed for it. But some wondered why, in the midst of a discussion of women’s privileges in the congre</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">gation, 1 Corinthians 7:1 was cited on page 253. That verse says: “Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is well for a man not to touch a woman.” It was cited to support a comment in the opening sentence in that paragraph, which reads: “At the congregation meeting here referred to according to the letter that was written to Paul by the Corinthians, ...” Before commenting on what Paul wrote the Corinthians, the book showed that he was replying to a letter from them, as established by 1 Corinthians 7:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you were puzzled about that, you probably wonder now how you could have missed the connection. We’ve all had similar experiences. This does, though, emphasize the importance of reading carefully what is said and looking up the texts involved. As another illustration of this: Some asked if Paul was first made an apostle twelve years after his conversion. The statement in the book that they had in mind reads: “Saul of Tarsus, twelve years after conversion called Paul, definitely did become a true apostle of Jesus.” (Page 166) What happened twelve years after Saul’s conversion? He was “called Paul.” Acts 13:9 is cited in the paragraph to substantiate this. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph in the book, Saul was converted about 35 C.E. But in commenting on something occurring about 47 C.E., twelve years after his conversion, the Bible first uses the name Paul for this apostle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In discussing the seed of “the woman” mentioned in Genesis 3:15, the book pointed out on page 59: “About 4,057 years after Jehovah God foretold [in 4026 B.C.E.] his raising up the seed of the woman as a liberator, this question [of identity] had all been worked out and decided.” But to what event do the 4,057 years lead? some asked. When, in 32 C.E., Jesus’ followers, especially Peter, acknowledged him as “the Christ, the Son of the living God,” the identity of the seed of God’s woman had been settled, and the mystery about it resolved.—Matt. 16:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Were you impressed with the fine illustrations? We were, and we heard many fine comments on them. One sister was particularly interested in the picture on page 229. Remember, it shows a man taking his bride home, while others flock around to share the happiness of the wedding, some holding aloft lamps. What wedding is it? It is an artist’s conception of the marriage discussed in Jesus’ parable in Matthew 25:1-10, mentioned in paragraph 19. Of course, the reason for Ham’s being illustrated with darker skin, on page 326, has already been presented in “Questions from Readers”; it was because his name means “swarthy” or “brown.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you recall the drawing beginning at the bottom corner of page 380 and running diagonally up to the top of page 381? It shows five different men looking heavenward, and then two groups doing the same. Did you identify Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, the apostles and the modern-day Christian witnesses of Jehovah? Not every person drawn in the book’s various illustrations has a definite identity; but on page 251 there is a portrayal of Jesus reclining at a meal with the twelve apostles, while a woman wipes Jesus’ feet with her hair.. Next tb one of the twelve there is a small box with a slit in the top. Which apostle is that? It is, of course, Judas Iscariot, who “had the money box” or took care of the money for the apostles. (John 12:1-7) Similarly, the drawing of Jesus instituting the Lord’s evening meal shows one empty place at the table. (Page 135) Whose spot is that? Yes, it is where Judas was during the Passover meal. A comparison of Matthew 26:20-25 with John 13:21-30 shows that he left before Jesus instituted this new celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though many have asked about the matter, there’s not much more to add to what was said on pages 163-167 concerning the apostles Matthias and Paul. As pointed out in the book, Matthias was definitely selected as an apostle to replace Judas Iscariot by the lots cast in the group of about 120. What about Matthias when Saul was chosen directly by Jesus? We don’t know. Saul, or Paul, was without question an apostle. (Gal. 1:1) While other men, such as Barnabas, were also termed apostles, Paul was one of the twelve faithful ones who were selected by Jesus himself, not by lot. (Acts 14:14; 26:12-18; John 17:12) Revelation 21:14 mentions “twelve apostles of the Lamb,” but it does not give us their names. Paul evidently was included, especially in view of his selection by Jesus and the way he was used to build up the congregation of God. This does not mean that Matthias was not one of the twelve apostles at Pentecost, 33 C.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Discussed at Bethel</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did the material in the Li/e </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting </span><span class="font10">book lead to some rewarding discussions in your congregation and your family? It did in our family here at Bethel. May we share a few of the comments with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One statement in the book that sparked many discussions is: “The ‘great tribulation’ of Revelation 7:14 refers to the final tribulation upon this human system of things.” (Page 356) Did you note the word “human”? Was there an adjustment in thinking on this matter? Yes. And we saw that there were reasons behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First, it was brought out in our discussions how reasonable and in accord with the facts is the position that this “great tribulation” has reference to an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">earthly</span><span class="font10"> tribulation on the nations. Jesus mentioned this “great tribulation” in connection with the sign of his second presence. (Matt. 24:21, 22) When he was enthroned in the autumn of 1914, World War I was in progress, a war exceeding anything in previous history and bringing with it disease, famine and sorrow. Apparently Satan caused it to begin just before the Kingdom’s establishment to hide that fact, to distract people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The evidences foretold by Jesus as making up the “sign” of his presence could be seen on earth. So the “great tribulation” did not have reference to something occurring invisibly in heaven. In fact, even God’s people did not fully appreciate that the war in heaven began in 1914, resulting in Satan’s ouster, until ten years afterward. However, all people alive then could easily recognize World War I as bringing great tribulation on mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, in our discussions the question came up, ‘If the great tribulation is so closely connected with World War I, would World War H be considered a resumption of the tribulation?’ No, that war was different. During World War I God’s people expected it to lead directly into Armageddon, but Jehovah prevented such a climax at that time. We didn’t succumb to such an expectation during World War II. Rather, in 1942 we learned that the war would end and that the beastly peace organization would be re-established. And that’s just what occurred. But when the tribulation is resumed, it will definitely lead into Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some noted, though, that the same sentence in the book identified it as a “final” tribulation. Does that not mean that “tribulation” is restricted to Armageddon? No, Daniel 12:1 shows that this “time of distress” is associated with Jesus’ standing up as king in 1914. The tribulation that began in that year was interrupted or “cut short.” Soon it will start again when the political element turns on Babylon the Great and destroys her. The events thus initiated will reach a climax of tribulation on the nations at their Armageddon destruction. So, as a whole it will be the “final” tribulation on this wicked system of things. In its last part it will be a “tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning . . . nor will occur again.”—Matt. 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another matter that we discussed with great interest was water baptism and its significance. What first got us thinking about this was the comment on page 90 to the effect that even as a babe Jesus was dedicated to God, being part of a dedicated nation. How did you react to that comment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thinking back, we could see how Jehovah dealt in a special way with the natural seed of Abraham. Isaac and Jacob were treated in a distinct way because they were in the line of the natural seed to which God had given the Promised Land. (Gen. 17:7, 8; 22: 15-18) With this promise in mind, He eventually redeemed the Israelites out of Egypt, taking them to himself as a special nation. (Ex. 6:6, 7; Deut. 7:6-11; 1 Chron. 17:21, 22) At Mt. Sinai they entered a formal, legal contract to be a nation dedicated to God. (Ex. 19:4-8; Josh. 24:16, 17) Did you think of some of those points when reflecting on the reason why the Jews could be considered a dedicated nation? With this as a basis, it was easy to see why Jesus’ baptism was not a symbol of a recent dedication to God, but of a presentation of himself to do Jehovah’s will at the due time.—Heb. 10:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our discussions, though, also helped us to realize how this affected the other Jews. As long as the Law was valid, they were dedicated to God. What about after it came to an end in 33 C.E.? As foretold at Daniel 9:27, Jehovah continued to deal with them as a favored and unique people until 36 C.E. even though the legal contract was not in effect. For three and a half years he gave them exclusive opportunity to be the spiritual seed of Abraham. The baptism of any dedicated Jew during that period would be in symbol of a presentation to do God’s will. But after 36 C.E. the natural Jews were put on an equal footing with the uncircumcised Gentiles and would have to make a personal dedication, and be baptized in symbol of it, if they wanted to be acceptable to God.—Rom. 11:25, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did you then begin thinking about John’s baptism? So did we. Up until Pentecost 33 C.E., sinful Jews desiring to do God’s will could be baptized by John the Baptist or by Jesus’ disciples in symbol of repentance. (Luke 3:3; John 3:22-26; 4:2) After Jesus’ resurrection he told his disciples to do baptizing in his name. So once the Christian congregation was established on Pentecost 33 C.E., baptism in the manner of John’s baptism was no longer valid. Anyone baptized in “the baptism of John” after that would have to be rebaptized, as were some in Ephesus. (Acts 19:3-5) (See also “Questions from Readers” in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> of May 1,1959.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Did This Impress You?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While the book literally teems with interesting facts and comments on Bible texts that are a blessing to consider, what about the overall picture some of the chapters developed? Did you stand back, as it were, and reflect on broad outlooks that the book should have helped us to cultivate, on how certain chapters will be priceless in aiding persons with whom we study and how we are now better prepared to face the future?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Take, for example, the chapters stressing the Scriptural position of neutrality in regard to the military and political affairs of the nations. Some years ago we had considerable material in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> about relative subjection to worldly “superior authorities,” but what a blessing to cover this subject again! And how fine was the presentation in the book, with many quotations from reputable historians. Now each time we study these chapters we will make even more firm our determination to act in accord with God’s will on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Have you noted that the brothers in more and more places have been tested in regard to this issue? With God’s help, they have been resolute when attempts were made to have all persons actively support the ruling party. It took faith and thorough knowledge of the Christian position. Yet, later when revolutions occurred and the opposition party came to power, the neutral position that our brothel's had taken protected them. They were not shot or imprisoned, as were many people who had been active in politics. Since nationalism is increasing, how appreciative we can be for the blessing of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font10"> book at this critical time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the past when studying with interested ones, what did you do to instruct them as to God’s law on blood? It wasn’t covered in any of the study books, was it? Isn’t it grand, though, to have a balanced and persuasive treatment of the topic in one of the books that each person will study, or at least read, before baptism? We can thus help to equip Bible students to face situations that might arise suddenly, requiring a quick decision. And if we meet someone in the field ministry who sincerely wants to know our position on this matter, there it is in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Similarly, ones with whom we study will learn that God has requirements as to marriage and divorce. Through the chapter on marriage they will see that they cannot just “think” they are legally married, and that any question about the legality of a divorce or marriage must be settled before they can be ministers of God. Where we feel that this might be a problem, we can plan to study that chapter before inviting them to join us in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And when speaking about important overall impressions we got, we can hardly skip the matter of developing proper respect for authority. Recall that two spheres of authority were highlighted, worldly governmental authority and the arrangement of theocratic authority through which God directs his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We know how respect for civil authority has helped Jehovah’s witnesses to avoid involvement, even out of curiosity, in the violence and looting taking place during periods of civil unrest and rioting. Our conduct has often gained us the respect of the authorities. The book may also help new ones to learn to follow the Scriptural course. But, additionally, didn’t it help us to see the need of having respect for heaven’s way of directing us? The principles used today in shepherding the congregations through appointed servants will be used in the new order. (Ps. 45:16) Instead of looking at the human imperfections of the appointed servants, we can concentrate on the fact that they are “gifts in men” selected by holy spirit. (Eph. 4:8, 11) No matter how long we have been serving God, we can be grateful to him for reminding us of this healthy outlook!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have been happy to be able to write and share these thoughts with you. Probably in studying the book personally and congrega-tionally you have found other points that you thoroughly enjoyed. And most likely as you continue to use and study the book it will keep on being a rich source of knowledge for you. We join with you in thanking Jehovah for providing such am abundant blessing —the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font10"> book!</span></p>

You feel free to talk to them and they feel free to talk to you. They may readily accept a subscription because they know you. But after they begin to receive and read the magazines they also may begin to learn the truth, and that would make you very happy, wouldn’t It? It would unquestionably make them happy too. —Matt. 22:39.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> And what about your own children? Do they have personal subscriptions of their own? Many parents have found it Is good for their children to have their own subscriptions for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. It</span><span class="font9"> comes through the mail with their name on it and it gives them a closer contact with Jehovah’s organization. It may help some to pay better attention at the Kingdom Hall, as they try to imitate older folks by using their magazines and listening to what is said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Then in February let’s concentrate particularly on those whom we know have shown interest in the truth—people on whom we make back-calls and with whom we conduct Bible studies, as well as any with whom they may have discussed</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">♦ If your congregation has older booklets in stock, we encourage you to leave two of these older booklets with a current booklet when a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">subscription is obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Gift Subscriptions: In sending these to the Society, please mark “GIFT&quot; at the top of the subscription slip. Also, please neatly print your name at the bottom of the slip so we can notify the subscriber that you are the giver of the gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Will you arrange for a chart of some kind at your Kingdom Hall to indicate progress made by your congregation during the subscription campaign? This may be done if you desire. ♦ Those planning to vacation pioneer in March or April are encouraged to see that the overseer has their applications at least a month ahead of time. ♦ Starting March 3, the circuit servant will begin to give the new talk &quot;Provision for ‘Rejoicing to Time Indefinite.' ” At circuit assemblies the new public talk will be &quot;Why Does God Permit Wickedness?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ It is suggested that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font7"> book be studied a second time at congregation book studies. All of us need to absorb the good instruction given in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ When you receive your new Yearbook you may want to make a correction in the service chart on page 43. We are sorry that Sweden incorrectly reported 83.017 Bible studies; the proper figure is 6.918, which represents the monthly average. So the grand total of studies, which appears on pages 28. 34. 43 and 287 in the book, should read 867,009 instead of 943,108.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ For several months we have not been able to fill requests from congregations for Kingdom Hall designs. Now </span><span class="font9">the truth, people on magazine routes, people who used to study but who are not now studying, or publishers who have become weak or inactive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> In March we can offer subscriptions to those with whom we do business, our employers as well as employees, the garageman and others. Then there is the beautician, neighbors you talk with at the laundromat, or the doctor, the grocer, salesmen, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> We will, of course, want to keep a good record of those who obtain literature from us or who show interest In our preaching work. Then during April, if not before, let's make an effort to contact as many of these as possible and offer subscriptions to all of them. That can include those who obtain single issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">or other literature, teachers and principals who obtained the special issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> or the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font9">book. Include also those who speak other languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> We know that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">can be helpful to all these people just as it has been to us. It has the Scriptural information they need. Yes, we have good news for the people and we look forward to a busy and happy time sharing It with them during the 1968 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">campaign.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">we again have a supply of Kingdom Hall designs on hand and such are available to congregations that are contemplating Kingdom Hall construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A special public talk on the subject &quot;What God’s High Priest Will Do for the People&quot; will be given in all congregations on March 31, 1968. The Society will provide a manuscript for the public talk. Handbills featuring just this one talk will be available at 25c for 1.000. If your circuit assembly or circuit servant’s visit is scheduled for March 31, you may have the special public talk on April 7. If you have already ordered handbills through March 31, your regular handbills will show the title of the special public talk for March 31. If you want more for that date, submit an order for some of the special handbills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Memorial this year will be on April 12, after 6 p.m. Memorial invitations may be ordered at 25c for 1,000; 15c for 500; 10c for 250. Submit your order with remittance for these invitations at the same time as the order for the special public talk handbills, but on separate order forms. Please order handbills and Memorial invitations early. ♦ New publications available:</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Do You Renew?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Did you know that our office in Brooklyn is sending to subscribers a combined total of over 1,385,000 copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> each time they are printed? And that is here in the United States alone. Isn’t it wonderful to know that, in addition to the 315,000 publishers here in the United States, so many others are regularly receiving the magazines and have opportunity to learn the truth through them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Of course, when these subscriptions expire, the question arises as to how many subscribers will renew and continue to receive the magazines. It may surprise you to learn that during the 1967 service year there were only about 320,000 subscriptions renewed. Sometimes, we have learned, even our brothers have forgotten to renew their subscriptions. Wouldn’t It be a fine thing if more subscribers would renew and continue to get the valuable information presented in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> To help publishers and interested ones alike, the Society is using a new renewal notice that can be seen to some extent even before the wrapper is taken off. In the future the Society will be sending just two notices: One marked “EXPIR-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Held: 20,151</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1968 342,516 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Excellently! Yes. 315,184 publishers shared in a grand witness—10,889 more than in November 1966. And did you notice that there were 10.939 regular pioneers? Never have we had so many in the United States!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, what about the “Evolution” book? It was received exceptionally well throughout the country. 502,798 new books were placed! That is the greatest distribution of the good news through the bound books since 1940, when we placed 522,788 in one month. Many congregations reported that their biggest difficulty was in keeping the brothers supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One publisher exclaimed: ‘Why. the “Evolution” book practically places itself.’ A brother, offering it with two magazines for 35c, placed seventeen copies along with thirty-four magazines one morning. Another said that due to the shortage of books in his congregation, they did not try to offer more than two at a door. But on leaving one home the householder called after him and asked if she might have ‘one more, please.’ We are truly grateful to have shared in this fine witness, aren’t we? And now we look forward to following up the interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Find Them All?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In our house-to-house ministry we often find that people are not at home, don’t we? Sometimes more are not at home than at other times. Do you keep an accurate record of every home where the occupants were not in? How mucli effort do you put forth to find the occupants of each house so as to give them a Kingdom witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> ‘But,’ you may ask, ‘is it really important to be so thorough in this matter of covering territory?' Many have felt that if we do not find people at home when working the territory one time, likely these people will be contacted another time when the territory is worked. But can we take chances with something like this, brothers? Lives are involved, aren’t they? We should do everything we can to search out the deserving ones living in each house. —Matt. 10:11; 2 Tim. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font9"> : 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> On pages 78 and 79 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Your </span><span class="font9">Word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Isa Lamp to My Foot’’</span><span class="font9"> we find this encouragement concerning thoroughness in territory coverage: “Endeavor to reach the occupants of every home with the good news, if at all possible. This will call for patient perseverance. First of all, as you work in the territory, keep a careful record of every place where people are not at home; then try again at another time.” But you may say: ‘What if the people are not at home on the second attempt?’ The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font9"> book continues: &quot;If they still are not at home, you may want to put a tract under their door,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Renew? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ING” will be placed in the first issue received during the month of expiration. The last notice will be marked “EXPIRED” and will be placed in the last issue the subscriber receives. What can we do as individual publishers? First, be prompt in renewing our own subscription when the “EXPIRING” notice appears. If you wish to renew for several years at a time, feel free to do so. Also be alert to help Interested ones renew their subscriptions. How can this be done? Some publishers keep a record of all subscriptions they obtain so they can handle the renewals. but keep on trying to make personal contact.” But, again, suppose you still find no one at home. Then what? The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font9"> book suggests: “Some publishers, after trying several times without finding anyone at home, write a letter in which they give a witness to the householder; or they may arrange for a publisher who is confined to home, due to illness or age, to write such letters.” These are practical suggestions, aren't they? Can we individually be more thorough in our endeavor to coritact all the occupants of each home in our territory? No doubt many of us can.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Some very fine results have been enjoyed by brothers and sisters who persevere in calling back on those not at home on first, second or third calls in a territory. As an example, in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1967 Yearbook,</span><span class="font9"> page 283, you will read an account about a sister in Switzerland who made twenty visits on one not-at-home, with the final outcome being that the occupant, when found at home, became a praiser of Jehovah’s name in a short time. You will enjoy reading other accounts on pages 136-137 and 198-199 of your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1968 Yearbook.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Our making every effort to find the “sheep” and give them the lifegiving waters of truth will be pleasing to Jehovah and will result in a thorough witness to God’s kingdom In our territory assignment. Don’t you agree that in many instances we could be more thorough in our territory coverage? Let’s try it! Especially during the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">campaign this year 1</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">• May back-calls ever be counted for visits to other publishers with a view to building them up spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under certain circumstances, yes. Remember, back-calls usually are return visits on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">unbaptized</span><span class="font7"> persons who have previously shown interest, to build them up spiritually. Some persons who have started out In the field service have not yet been baptized. They are in training to be ministers, but they need personal assistance. It is wise to continue having a home Bible study with such persons, and each of such visits is to be counted as a back-call. They also need to be regular in meeting attendance, and your calls to invite them or to take them with you may be counted as back-calls If you succeed in contacting them. Similarly, If you get together to work on a sermon for held service, or If you call such a person to arrange for him to share with you in the service, or pick him up on the way to the territory, this is a back-call. It Is fine that you are putting forth this effort to help your prospective brother. In determining whether to count the call, ask yourself: Was I just making a neighborly call, or did I make the call with the intention of helping the person to progress spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others in need of personal help may at one time have got baptized. But if someone has not been out in the service for the past six months, he really Is no longer a publisher, even if he was baptized. Still. perhaps he can be aided. If you visit him to offer spiritual help, you may count It as a back-call. But it would be better to help such persons before they get to that point. To encourage this, anyone who actually conducts a home Bible study with a person who. though baptized, is both Irregular in service (missing entire months) and seldom comes to meetings may count each of such visits as a back-call. The important thing Is to help these persons to get their feet firmly set on the way to life.</span></p>

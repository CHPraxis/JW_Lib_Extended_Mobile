<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Filled with the holy spirit and ... speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acfs4:31. &nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. HI NO. 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Maintain Maturity with Our Brothers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> We all know, of course, that pressing forward to maturity is absolutely essential, but equally vital is keeping our maturity. This maturity we have attained we must keep with our brothers, associating with them at meetings and in the ministry. Keeping regular in the ministry helps us guard and maintain our maturity and offers us the opportunity also of aiding new ones to press forward to maturity. You well know that to begin progressing toward maturity people need the Bible, and this month we are privileged to offer it in all seven languages in which the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New 'World Translation</span><span class="font7"> is published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> As we have already experienced, the Bible is a most pleasurable thing to offer. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New WorldTranslation</span><span class="font7"> is so easy to understand, so helpful, that once people begin to realize its value, they eagerly want a copy. So besides offering it at appropriate times to friends, neighbors and others you meet, you will want to make effective use of it in your territory. Since December was the last month we worked with the Bible offer, it would be timely for magazine-territory servants to ascertain what territory was not covered during the previous Bible campaign. Ascertain, too, what foreign languages are likely to be spoken in these territories ; then be prepared not only with the regular complete English edition for $1, but with the Christian Greek Scriptures, for 50 cents, available in Drench, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and German. So give all persons in your territory an opportunity to have this fine Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> You will, of course, want to be prepared by being familiar with the sermon and with “Renderings of Scriptures Compared,” which you received last year. It would be well, as part of your preparation, to check the condition of the Bible in your brief bag so that none of us offers a tattered or soiled copy. It copy of the Bible to offer in the witness work. When householders do not accept the Bible, you can drop down to two magazines on a contribution of 10 cents. Many publishers report that by doing this they are able to place regularly and consistently far more than the monthly quota.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> You will be interested to know that some brothers have had fine experiences by going to motel and hotel managers, showing them the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> and asking if they would like to obtain copies for rooms.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> How did we do this April? Very well, indeed, and we can all truly rejoice at the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon our united activity. —-Ps. 100: 1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Not only did we enjoy a fine 12.7-percent increase with 315,568 publishers in the field—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> our activity is well ahead of last year’s fine report. Outstanding is the fact that, for the first time, we went</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">, “New World Translation of the Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• Scriptures,” and a booklet; regular edition, $1; deluxe edition, $2.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Maintaining Maturity with Our Brothers.—Heb. 6:1, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">over the six-million mark in magazine placements. Think of the fine witness given by such an excellent distribution of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AwakeI</span><span class="font7"> magazines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Moreover, notice the increase in back-calls and Bible studies. How splendid this is, for it shows that we are not only interested in finding the “sheep” in our territory but also in feeding and tenderly caring Bible in each room; hence many managers have been pleased to obtain the Bible at such a reasonable price. It would be well, then, for each congregation to select one or two capable brothers to make calls on motel and hotel managers. The Society would appreciate having a report on any unusual experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Also of keen interest is the fact that our younger publishers have shared successfully and commendably in the Bible work. One circuit servant writes: “While I was serving with a congregation in Pennsylvania an eleven-year-old publish-</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued, on page</span><span class="font7"> J, coZ. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3) </span><span class="font7">studies in April, over- and above the excellent March report, our prospects for continued expansion are very fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> It is also very pleasing to report that. 1,427 congregations reported “We made it!” compared to 1,376 last year. Commendably, too, there were 13,025 vacation pioneers during April, and this is 2,646 more than last year. How grateful we all</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Theocratic News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">18 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Presenting the Good News —discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">12 min: Concluding comments. (Include encouraging remarks on “April’s Joyful Report” and comment on slogan at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font6">Talk on “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies and “Showing Christian Love at Assemblies,” from June 1, 1964, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Shoulder Your Responsibility as a New Publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font6">Demonstration on use of “Renderings of Scriptures Compared.” (Publishers should bring their copy, along with Bibles, to meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Material in “Renderings of Scriptures Compared” can be used at conclusion of sermon or in answering objections such as “I already have a Bible.” In either case householder can be invited to get his Bible, if this appears to be best. Then comparisons can be made to show the superiority of the “New World Translation.” In certain scriptures the “Douay” or “King James Version” may not be too different from the “New World Translation.” After determining what Bible version householder lias, appropriate comparisons can be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">DISCUSSION (6 min.) Chairman directs audience in lively and informative discussion as comparisons are made in various texts. Three minutes can be taken in discussing those texts where the “New World Translation” is greatly superior to the “King James Version” and the same can be done with reference to the “Douay Version.” Publishers may make notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">DEMONSTRATION (4 min.) Capable publisher gives presentation, making comparison with “King James Version.” Householder says: “I already have a Bible.” Householder is invited to get Bible and attention is directed to Matthew 5:3. After reading scripture the question is asked: “Just what does it mean to be ‘poor in spirit’? Are we to understand from this that having a small amount of God’s spirit is a good thing? [Let householder comment.] Notice how clear the thought is made by the ‘New World Translation.’ [Read.]” If 1 Corinthians 10:24 is used, the householder could be asked: “Just what do you understand from this? Was the apostle Paul telling us that we should try to get someone else’s money? [Let householder comment.] Notice how clear the ‘New World Translation’ is when it says: [Read.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">DEMONSTRATION (4 min.) Capable publisher shows how scripture comparisons can be used for the “Douay Version.” After reading Matthew 11:12 the question is asked: “Just what do you understand by the words ‘suffereth violence and the violent bear it away’? Are violent persons able to interfere with God’s kingdom? Let us read this verse from the ‘New World Translation’ and then see if the meaning of Jesus’ words is made clear.” If the scripture at 1 Corinthians 10:25 is used, the question could be asked: “Just what does the word <sup>;</sup> ‘shambles’ mean? [Allow time for comment by householder, but no embarrassing silence.] Notice how any difficulty is cleared up when this text is read from the ‘New World Translation.’ [Read.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Scripture comparisons should be pasted in back of Bible and appropriate notations can be made. Which texts are used will depend upon the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Galatians 6:1, at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Encouraging talk by magazine-territory servant stimulating more to share in magazine activity. 15 min: “Appreciating Jehovah’s Provisions.” Concentrate on “Yearbook” experiences to illustrate theme; introduction should be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meetings and assemblies are outstanding provisions from Jehovah. A Witness from England was impressed by appreciation shown for meetings by brothers in Barbados. (267 ill) Witnesses in North Borneo consider Jehovah’s provision for assembling together so vital they have sacrificed good jobs to be able to attend meetings. (247 111) Appreciating that meetings and assemblies are for Christians of all ages, a 92-year-old sister in the Bahamas never misses. (99 UI) Properly appreciating assemblies, Witnesses in Australia expended themselves to get to Melbourne. (96 111) When necessary, Witnesses in Africa walk great distances under a blazing sun, so keenly do they appreciate assemblies. (123 U4) Do we have similar appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">20 min: Starting Studies When Placing Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Let’s continue to be Bible-study conscious and start studies at every opportunity. Note how this may be done on initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SCENE I (7 min.) Publisher concludes sermon with John 17:3, places Bible and “This Good News of the Kingdom” booklet. He opens booklet to message on inside cover and points out value of examining source of good news, the Bible. Reads to householder question 2(b) on page 3 and uses points in paragraph 2 to emphasize value of gaining sure hope from Bible. Discusses paragraphs 4 and 5 with householder. Arranges to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) How can a publisher not conducting a study be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SCENE II (7 min.) Mature publisher discusses with less experienced publisher need of starting studies. He explains how easy return visit is, requiring only the use of a scripture or two to get into the “Good News” booklet. Less experienced one asks to be shown. Mature one demonstrates, using less experienced one as householder. States, “You will recall the scripture, at Revelation 21:3, 4, that we talked about last week. Conditions that will come on earth in the future under God’s kingdom were described. This is good news. In the booklet left last week, ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ this good news is further explained.” Brings out copy, reads question on paragraph 3, then discusses and reads paragraph. Does same with paragraph 4. (Chairman breaks in—paragraphs 5 and 6 or more may be covered, depending on householder. See how arrangements are made for continuing study.) Mature one concludes, making definite arrangements to continue discussion following -week. Less experienced publisher feels he could do this; it is not hard at all. Mature publisher will practice with him and go along on a call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Share in the joyous work of conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Gaining Strength by Mutual Encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Talk on monthly theme. (See “Watchtower” of July 15, 1963, pp. 424-436, also July. 1, 1964.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “The Assistance Arrangement (Part 1).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">20 min: Sermon: “Flee from Babylon the Great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Display new sermon on platform. It will be used three months. Learn it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Develop sermon with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Flee from Babylon the Great Gen. 11:9—Babel center of false worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 18:2—Babylon, place of unclean exhalation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 18:4—Get out of Babylon the Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:4—Blessings for those who flee</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Suggested sermon: ‘Good morning. 1 am calling to encourage home use of the Bible. During my brief visit this morning I would like to point out to you two interesting facts presented in the Bible. Do you recall where the different languages came from? [Allow for comment.] Genesis chapter 11 tells of the tower of Babel, which was built to promote false worship. It was not approved by God, and in Genesis 11:9 we learn . . . [Read and make appropriate comments.] In describing conditions seen in our day, Revelation 18:2 refers to Babylon the Great, which, like those who built the tower of Babel, promotes false worship displeasing to God. What is Babylon the Great, which is inhabited by offensive creatures? It is important that we know because God-fearing Christians are urged at Revelation 18:4 . . . [Read and comment.] To aid you to find the answer to this question, we would like to encourage you to accept this home Bible-study aid “ ‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules’” and read the answer in your own Bible. It is important that you know, because the Bible assures us that after the destruction of Babylon the Great there will be on this earth [Paraphrase Revelation 21:4.] no more sickness, sorrow or death, but, rather, happiness and endless life and peace, because God’s kingdom will then rule. This copy is yours for only 75 cents, along with this Bible-study booklet.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (5 min.) Demonstrates sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encourage all to use sermon during July, August and September. Use it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Assistance Arrangement (Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> As we have experienced, Jehovah, through his organization, has always provided assistance and training so his ministers could grow to maturity and improve their effectiveness in declaring the good news. (Eph. 4:11-13) And it is true today. For several years now we have received the benefits of the training program and the assistance arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The training program is for the more advanced publishers who can, with additional training, be assigned to train still others. (2 Tim. 2:2) The assistance arrangement is primarily designed to assist new, less experienced publishers who are not spiritually strong. It will help these publishers to become more regular and effective in Jehovah’s service, mature ministers, by providing publishers to work with them consistently in the different features of the service, encouraging them to attend meetings and studying with them when necessary. The assistance arrangement, therefore, is really a steppingstone to bring publishers on to the level of spiritual development where they may benefit from the more advanced training program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> The overseer plays a prominent role in organizing the assistance arrangement. As he visits the service centers he should arrange for the more mature and experienced</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Use at least a half hour on the service meeting to discuss experiences and counsel received at the district assembly the week after most of those in your congregation attend. Have a review and practical discussion of things learned at the assembly, including encouraging experiences that were related. Take care to highlight the matters that need particular attention in your congregation. This should be carefully planned by the congregation servant in advance. Make whatever adjustments are necessary in the service meeting schedule in order to put on this special program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Do you plan to share the joys of vacation pioneering for two weeks, a month or even more this summer? If so, get an application and fill it out right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Inquiries have been made as to whether extra sets of the film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” are available for local congregations and circuits to use in their territories. Also, some individuals have inquired. The cost of the film will be $180 a set for 16-mm single perforated. For double perforated the cost is $215. Money must accompany the order. A narration script is supplied with each set of film, which comes in seven 400-foot reels. Scripts are available in English and Spanish. For orders received from outside the United</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">publishers to work with those who need help and encouragement. Before visiting the group he will make an analysis of the Publisher’s Record cards so he will know who needs assistance as well as those who can provide the assistance. Then he will talk to the more mature and experienced publishers, asking them to work regularly with the publishers who need the assistance, outlining the help needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> In large congregations, where it will be some time before the overseer gets around to all the service centers, study conductors will arrange for the more experienced ones to assist those who need help. Study conductors will first discuss their suggestions for the group with the overseer before putting them into operation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Who will be doing the assisting under this arrangement? Publishers starting out new ones in the service will not only continue their studies with them but will also want to help them in the field service. The experience and knowledge of mature publishers, pioneers and dedicated parents should be utilized in helping new publishers. Study conductors themselves will also assist weaker and less experienced ones. In each case, the mature ones taking the lead should be advised of the particular needs of the one(s) being assisted. Then they can work on improving one point at a time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">States, shipping costs will be added to the above prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Literature offer: July through September, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font6"> and 32-page booklet, for 75c. The question booklet will not be placed with the book. Congregations may carry a small stock for Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Did your career as a publisher of the good news commence recently, possibly in April? Your fellow publishers welcome you warmly into the ranks of active praisers of Jehovah’s name. Now that you have taken this initial but very important step, what will your course be during the months to come? One of constant progress, assuredly, shouldering responsibility even though you may have many things to learn as a new publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> First of all, learn to appreciate that you are not alone in this grand work. You have many sources of help. Reliance should be placed in Jehovah and not in self, as he points out at Zechariah 4:6, “Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit.” In addition to this help, the one who has been conducting the study with you will be happy to offer assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Taking in spiritual food is an unending process and is specially vital now at this point in your preaching career. Do not recommend to your teacher that the home Bible study that has been conducted with you be stopped just because you have started in the field activity and are attending congregation meetings. Continue the study and seek to improve your own personal study habits too. You should also read and study </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> regularly along with the Society’s other publications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Association with other active servants of Jehovah is likewise essential. This means that you will want to attend all the meetings, preparing well for them and then participating in them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Having started to serve actively in the field, you will want to preach and teach regularly from this point on, having some share in the service every week, if possible. Mature publishers have a schedule to guide them, and a weekly one is best. Schedules can be discussed with one of the mature brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> As a new publisher you will be greatly blessed as you shoulder your responsibility in serving God, keeping in mind that this is now a part of your worship.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Many fine reports have been received on the results from using simplified sermons. You will want to be prepared with one of the following for use in presenting the Bible offer:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. My name is ------. My purpose in calling is to encourage people of all religions to do more Bible reading. Almost everyone would like to spend more time reading the Bible. Some say they do not read the Bible because it is difficult to understand. Perhaps this has been your experience. [Allow householder to comment.] The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> is in modern English such as we use today. This complete Bible is yours for only $1. With the Bible we are giving a copy of this printed sermon in booklet form.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> If John 17: 3 is used you could say: “Good morning. My name is ------. The purpose of my visit is</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Fruitage of the Spirit&quot; Assemblies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Conventions start this month I Those who will attend the first of the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies, at Atlantic City, undoubtedly have made their plans. But if not, you should do so immediately, sending in your Room Request to the convention headquarters in the assembly city.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Bear in mind that this is a FOUR-DAY assembly, and it is important to be there Thursday afternoon at 1:40 when it starts and stay until the program concludes on Sunday at 5 :15 p.m. In almost every case the baptism will be on Friday, and candidates for immersion will want to be on hand in ample time for the discourse at 9 a.m. To get the most out of an assembly, you should have your Bible with you, as well as a songbook, and a pad for taking notes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Arrangements are made for field service Friday and Saturday mornings at all the conventions. Why not share in it? Be generous with good things that Jehovah has given us and exhibit this by<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark13">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark14">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark15">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark16">5</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote6"></a><a href="#bookmark17">6</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#bookmark18">7</a></sup>&nbsp;sharing in field service during the period allotted for it. Obtain your territory in adto encourage Bible reading. Most people have a Bible in their home. [Allow householder to tell you if he has a Bible.] The importance of reading the Bible and understanding what it says is stressed by Jesus’ words as recorded at John 17: 3. [Read and make appropriate brief comments.] The Bible I have been reading from is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New &quot;World Translation</span><span class="font7"> and it is in modern English. This translation makes Bible reading more enjoyable and understandable. I would like to leave a copy with you, along with this printed sermon, on a contribution of only $1.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> If the Bible is not placed, take advantage of the opportunity to offer the two latest magazines. They can be presented by saying: “Millions of people regularly read the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines. I would like to leave with you the latest copies of these two Bible journals on a contribution of only 10 cents.” vance, perhaps the evening before, and then you can go directly to your territory in the morning. When staying in private homes keep in mind the additional opportunities to witness. The ones with whom you stay should be invited to the convention and assisted, if possible, with particular stress on the public meeting. Even en route to the assembly you can share in the service by placing magazines with those you meet; so be sure to carry literature with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Certainly our assemblies have a splendid reputation in the minds of tiie people because of the fine conduct of those who attend. We are an exhibition of how people can live together in unity, and this is amazing to the world. When our conduct reflects the fruitage of God’s holy spirit, not only in the field ministry but at all times, others will discern that the thing that makes Jehovah’s witnesses so different is that they live in accord with God’s righteous principles and have God’s spirit. May we all, by our Christian conduct, help many to see that during the months to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup></sup> Though house-to-house work will undoubtedly be your main way of placing Bibles, you will not want to forget persons who have taken subscriptions.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER, 1964 “Filled with fire holy spirit and ... speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31. VOL.VH NO. 11</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>^Dea/c ^Pab^isfie/te:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Some of us got to Pittsburgh for the annual meeting of the Society on October 1, and it was a stimulating one-day assembly. Eleven of the students from Gilead School were there, and all of them gave talks. Pryce Hughes flew over from England, and August Peters from Germany, and they each gave reports too. So we heard quite a variety of wonderful experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The business meeting part of the three-hour program was very short. Brother Sullivan and Brother Suiter were reelected as directors of the Pennsylvania corporation of the Society. Then Brother Knorr gave a very interesting talk on the subject “Do Not Become Fearful of Those Who Kill the Body.” 1,507 were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, only a few of the Bethel family were at that meeting; most of the 673 members of the family were caring for their assignments at Bethel. My, how the Bethel family has grown 1 In 1944 there were 228, and then by 1954 it had jumped to 440; now it is up to 673 —an increase of 233 in just the past ten years. But it has required many more than that to keep things going, because there are eighty to a hundred that leave Bethel each year for various reasons, and these have to be replaced in order to supply the needs of you brothers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are wonderful opportunities here at Bethel for young men who really want to work in the ministry, and we here often wonder why there are not a lot more who apply for Bethel service. At conventions we see so many healthy young men who have not applied for Bethel and who are not in the pioneer service. But, really, knowing as we do that the old system of things is coming to its end, what work could be more worthwhile? It’s something to think about. Among those attending Gilead School here we meet many who have spent ten, fifteen, twenty and some as high as forty or more years in Bethel homes as branch servants in different parts of the earth. They</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Meeting the Challenge of the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Can you accept a challenge? David did. When Goliath defied Jehovah and hurled a challenge at Israel’s army, it was the young lad David who courageously accepted. Meeting that challenge was for the stronghearted. Don’t you agree?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Having a full share in the ministry today as one of God’s public servants presents no less a challenge in many respects. To overcome the obstacles of householder indifference, outright worldy and demon opposition, and our own fleshly weaknesses requires Jehovah’s spirit. He can be counted on to back us up when we are doing his will. But we must demonstrate initiative, determination and true zeal for right worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The challenge will never be met unless we have the highest of are fine examples, and more like them are needed to care for this growing organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the Bethel family are talking about going to Europe next year to visit our brothers at the assemblies on the other side of the Atlantic. They won’t be traveling alone either, because over 1,500 individuals have already written requesting final information about attending those European assemblies in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the meantime, it is good to see that so many are working hard in the field service. Didn’t we get off to a fine start for the new service year, with 292,512 publishers? Now, during November, we will be offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font10"> book again. All of us have had quite a bit of experience with it, so it should prove to be a most enjoyable month in the field service. It’s a privilege for us to work closely with all of you, and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing. Lots of love from us to all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers at</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Bkooklyn Bbanch Office </span><span class="font10">motives and the soundest of reasons. These we have. We are vitally concerned for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the saving of lives of interested persons.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Look closely at the example of those who have displayed outstanding zeal for the public ministry. Concerning Jesus it was said that the zeal for his Father’s house had eaten him up. (John 2:17) Jeremiah said Jehovah’s word was like a fire in his bones, that he was not able to hold it within him. (Jer. 20:9) How good it is to know that we also have such individuals in our congregations today! Now, how can we benefit by their presence? Associate closely with them and work with them whenever possible. In fact, you will find these brothers available for help in the assistance arrangement, eager to assist the less experienced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Are you a family head? If so, you have a particular responsibility in meeting the challenge. It is essential that you personally lead in the ministry, making a diligent effort to meet the service goals, and aid the other members of your family to do the same. How are many family heads successfully meeting this responsibility? By a practical family schedule including study, preparation for service and balanced field ministry. True, it takes initiative to work up such a schedule and determination to keep it going, but this is part of the challenge. The end result is a happy family, blessed by Jehovah, busily and regularly sharing in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you are a young publisher, part of meeting the challenge is to cooperate wholeheartedly with your parents in a family schedule. Have you young folks ever considered the joy it brings your father and mother to see you happily participating in the service, eagerly getting ready</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Suggested introduction and transition : Tn these days when sickness, death, delinquency and disunity among people are the major items in the news, I would like to brighten your day by showing you briefly the Bible’s promise of better conditions to come on earth. Certainly you would enjoy receiving good news for a change, isn’t that time? Revelation 21:3, 4 gives this good news. [Read and comment on it.] You may wonder, though, how this could come about, in view of the seemingly permanent gloomy conditions on earth. It can be only through the power of God. His promised remedy is clearly stated here at Psalm 37:10, 11. [Read and comment.] To be among the righteous, the Bible shows here at John 17:3, we need knowledge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ. [Read and comment.] For the purpose of helping you to take in knowledge of God and to have confidence that the Bible is inspired, we are offering the Bible in modern English and a splendid Bible study aid. You may have this copy of the “New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures” and this book “AH Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” for only $2. [Show features of book, such as Study 10, pages 337349, on fulfilled prophecy and other reasons why Bible is authentic and true, or comment that book covers all 66 books of Bible, showing who the writers are, when they were written, what they contain and why each book is beneficial for us today.] With these we are leaving two booklets free.’ After placing offer, demonstrate study of booklet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">to go in the work and cooperating to the full within the family in all the other little ways that are essential if a schedule is to be successful? How much easier it is to meet the challenge when all work together toward a common goal I Like young David, accept the challenge and meet it, because this is well pleasing to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Perhaps you are one of the newly associated ones in Jehovah’s organization. As you learn the truth you can show appreciation to Jehovah for the things you have learned by taking up the challenge to preach. Learn to trust in Jehovah for strength to do his will. Also, be assured that the more experienced publishers will be pleased to assist you.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Are you accepting the challenge and meeting it? If so, your zealous, courageous response will win you Jehovah’s blessing and approval.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a fine way to start off a new service year! That is how we feel about magazine placements for September. Special pioneers averaged 162.7, well above their goal of 150. Regular and vacation pioneers placed an average of 99.7, just .3 short of their 100, and congregation publishers barely missed averaging 12, with 11.9. In actual magazines placed it means that all of us together placed 4,543,954, or 649,082 more magazines than we did in the same month last year. If we keep this increase up each month, we will have a fine magazine report this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Enjoying Jehovah's Provisions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When we enjoy something we usually like to enjoy it to the full, isn’t that right? And, when we do, how truly satisfying it is I Just as this is true of enjoying material things, so it is of spiritual things, including the meetings Jehovah has lovingly provided for our benefit each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To enjoy the meetings fully we should be on time for them. Are you there to sing the song and to join in the prayer or do you find yourself coming in late, causing heads to turn and minds to wander from instruction as you move about finding a seat? Or have you ever been a speaker who stood in front of an “audience” of empty chairs, feeling disappointment because so few came to hear the vitally important introductory remarks? Then you know how much you appreciate it when everyone is on time. Why not plan to enjoy the whole program and get all the benefit possible on these occasions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Fully enjoying Jehovah’s provision of the meetings is largely a matter of schedule and habit. As one family head with ten children commented : “When I come home from work we all get ready for the meeting first. Then we sit down for the evening meal. After the meal we have a half hour to rest and study before leaving for the meeting.” This brother, with his entire family, is</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">♦ All congregations should plan special activity for December 25. Either the Bible and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font8"> or magazines may be used. Additional magazines should be ordered by November 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ At the service centers the following program should be followed on Sunday mornings: November 8, review complete sermon “Flee from Babylon the Great.” November 15, friendly, interesting introductions. November 22, introductions geared to circumstances encountered in homes locally. November 29, starting studies in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font8"> booklet on initial call. (See July </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span><span class="font8"> December 6, review sermon “The Bible’s Promise of a Better System of Things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Overseer to visit Bible study servant early in month, working with him in service, especially on back-calls. He should offer suggestions on improving and increasing his assistance to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Literature offer: December, New </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial*’</span><span class="font8"> with two booklets for $2. January through April, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> subscription campaign. Year’s subscription and three booklets, $1. (Include </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New”</span><span class="font8"> so studies may be started.) Order booklets and increase magazine supply now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Yearbook and calendar orders may </span><span class="font10">always among the first to arrive at the Kingdom Hall, because they plan ahead and the children cooperate in getting ready early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Moreover, if we prepare well for each meeting, there will be a mutual interchange of encouragement and we can build up one another’s faith. (Korn. 1:11, 12) Why not come prepared to comment at least once at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study each week and, as the occasion affords, at all the other meetings too. This will not only increase your own enjoyment but also add to the pleasure and profit of those listening. True, this requires preparation, but the more we put into any meeting, the more spiritual benefit and enjoyment we derive from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> If you are a servant, do you try to be on hand at least twenty minutes before each meeting to care for your duties and to assist the publishers? Not only is this an evidence of maturity, but think of the good example it sets for all in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Finally, Jehovah’s loving provisions now include the program of daily Bible reading. Do you schedule time to read the Bible regularly each day? How this enriches our faith and adds to our enjoyment of the meetings! Why not plan on sharing in all of these blessings, for then you ■will experience the satisfaction that comes from enjoying Jehovah’s provisions to the full.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> With many of us one of the biggest problems in the witness work is how to start the conversation—what to say first. Should it be pointed or general? What subject should we start on? How can we catch a person’s interest? It is good to give this matter thought and to discuss it with other publishers. Try various approaches. You will find it rewarding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First of all, a sincere and friendly greeting- is always in order. Most people appreciate it when someone shows a little interest in them. Have you ever worked with a publisher who started the conversation by saying to the householder: “Hello. I’m glad I found you home”? It is a friendly approach, isn’t it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But the big question is: What approach or subject will both catch and hold the interest of this person? This, of course, depends on the person to whom you are talking. What catches the attention of the woman in one house may not be of interest to the man next door. So be observant of people and their interests. Take these things into consideration: use versatility and good judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If a man or a woman opens the door and you hear children playing, you might say: “Those of us who have children are concerned for their safety and future. My call today is to point to a warning God has given us. It has to do with our worship. Our knowing the warning and heeding it can result in everlasting happiness and security for us and our children.” Then give the Babylon sermon, applying it to the householder.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Men, women and young people are interested in the future. You might say: “Most people are interested in the future and what it holds for them and those they love. Observe how the Bible tells, not only of the past, but also of the future and how we can benefit from knowing the future.” Then proceed with the Babylon sermon or anothei’ appropriate topic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> You will find other interesting and timely introductions that will effectively catch interest in your territory. Keep looking for new ideas that are appropriate and effective. Remember that the householder wants to know why you are there. So without delay, get to the point. At the same time make your approach an interesting one so he will listen. What you have to say is important ; as the Bible says, “The mouth of the righteous one is a source of life.”—Prov. 10:11.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a pleasure it is to see a newly interested person drink in the waters of truth at a home Bible study I As this knowledge transforms his mind, we look forward to the time when he will want to have a share in presenting the good news. But what if he says, “I COULD NEVER DO THAT WORK”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is only natural that one without experience would feel somewhat inadequate when beginning a new work. Especially is this so when he appreciates how very important that work is. So do not be discouraged; rather, you might commend him for his humility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But, even so, it is entirely right for a person who has been studying for a while to begin to tell others some of the things that he knows. And if he stops to think about it, he will realize that he knows so much more than those he will meet at the doors. When Jesus sent out the twelve apostles to begin preaching, they surely had much to learn. (Matt. 10:5-42) Yet they went.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In sharp contrast to the condemned and dying Babylonish systems of false worship, Jehovah’s organization continues to flourish and expand. (Isa. 54:2) And so that proper care can be given to the many new ones the command is given: “Make the place of your tent more spacious.” In obedience, we must ready ourselves for the increase, and we have reason to expect some of that increase during the month of December. We will be working to reach the ten-percent goal of 321,550 publishers. Can we make it? All that is required is 5,982 publishers in addition to the 315,568 who shared in service in April of this year. With 219,677 studies being conducted on the average each month during the past year, there is an excellent potential.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Early in the month the overseer may find it advantageous to have a meeting with all the servants and study conductors to discuss the work. The servants will also need the help of you other regular and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">What knowledge they had they made use of. Remind him of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In Jesus’ day, fishermen, housewives and others shared in the ministry. They were working people. The same is true today, and this your student will discover as he meets others in the congregation. Also, God does not ask us to do something that he won’t give us the strength to do. This is God’s work and his spirit will back us up. —2 Cor. 3:4-6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Additionally, the new publisher will get the very best kind of training, and it may put him at ease if you explain the arrangement. You can help him to work out a very simple presentation and rehearse it with him. Then he can accompany you in the field and can have a small part in the presentation when he feels ready. This can be expanded as he progresses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The important thing is to be willing to be trained and take the step forward. (Ps. 110:3) Encourage him to have that attitude. Just think of the many happy publishers of the good news that at one time said: “I could never do that work!” mature publishers, to offer loving assistance to irregular publishers and inactive ones. We are sure that you will be glad to help. And what about those with whom you have a home Bible study? Have they progressed. sufficiently to share in the field ministry? What a happy experience it will be if they start in the service with you during December! A meeting might also be arranged with the pioneers and those doing vacation pioneer work during December. They will be glad to know what opportunities there are to arrange for others to work along with them in Jehovah’s service; it will be mutually upbuilding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Each one of us can do much to share in the expansion work. When asked to assist someone, work at it just as patiently as with a new home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah assures us that the increase will come. He has promised to bless the efforts put forth. Do we have any reason to hold back? Certainly not.'</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font8">• Should one of Jehovah’s witnesses go to a religious hospital for treatment and care?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a hospital is owned by a false religious organization, then it is operated by a segment of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. So those of Jehovah’s witnesses who live in an area where they have a choice of hospitals would undoubtedly choose a hospital that is in no way associated with a false religious organization. However, sometimes persons are unconscious and cannot make a choice, or there is no other hospital in the vicinity, or the religious hospital may be the only one equipped to care for the particular thing needing attention. Under these circumstances one of Jehovah’s witnesses might go to the religious hospital and pay for care he receives, viewing this simply as paying for services rendered. It would not be the same as making- a contribution for the purpose of supporting the false religious organization. Thus, Jehovah’s witnesses may go to religious hospitals for treatment and care if circumstances require it and if they choose to do so.</span></p>

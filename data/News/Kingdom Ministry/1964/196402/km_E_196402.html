<p><span class="font8">Apply the General Priesthood Principle</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Those who have the high honor of being in the “royal priesthood” have an inescapable obligation. They must declare abroad ‘the excellencies of the one that called them out of darkness into his wonderful light.’ (1 Fet. 2:9) Since all the spirit-begotten Christians must be light bearers, their priesthood is truly a general priesthood. Though the “great crowd” of “other sheep” are not a priestly class as are the spirit-anointed Christians, the principle of the general priesthood applies to all the “great crowd.” So we all have the obligation to declare abroad the excellencies of God, as long as the darkness of this system of things lasts. Helping us carry out our lightbearing obligation is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> which has proved itself since 1879 an instrument of light.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> As we seek to bring people out of darkness into light by effective use of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> we do well to reflect on the many avenues open to us that offer opportunities to obtain subscriptions. By taking proper advantage of all these avenues, we will no doubt reach the goal, by the end of the month, of each publisher’s having obtained at least one new subscription, pioneers ten and special pioneers fifteen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Hany of us will reach our goals through the main avenue of house-to-house work. By making a schedule, we will be able to spend at least two hours </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font11"> week in house-to-house work, using either the simplified sermon or the regular one. We want to try to hold to our schedule even if we live in the colder parts of the country. If living in cold areas, dress warmly and select territory that is most convenient for the work. Perhaps the working of apartments could be saved for the coldest days. If there are no apartments and extreme weather rules out regular house-to-house work, select territory where work can be done from the car.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is also important to be thorough in performing our ministry. By keeping a separate house-to-house record of not-at-homes, we will be able to make contact at more homes in our territory during the campaign, resulting in a thorough witness and more subscriptions. At all times in our house-to-house work let us be alert to the sixty-six languages in which </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is published. Refer to the inside cover for information, should householders read a language other than English.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">and regular and special pioneers, our April report was not only the highest ever in publishers, namely, 308,370, but, additionally, April’s report showed all-time highs in virtually every other feature of the ministry. The activity of vacation pioneers played a vital role in making last April’s splendid report. It was a pleasure to receive many expressions from congregations that had vacation pioneers, saying: “The subscription at a later date; offering the subscription to persons with whom Bible studies are being conducted ; presenting it to interested persons on whom we are making back-calls; not forgetting to offer it to friends and relatives. Then, of course, there are the opportunities that come our way to do incidental witnessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Talk on main article “Apply the General Priesthood Principle.” (Concentrate on material in the article.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font10">min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Find, Feed and Tenderly Care . . . pars. 1 to 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: Calling Back on Those Whose Subscriptions Have Expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Many old expiration slips are still in the hands of publishers. During this “Watchtower” campaign a special effort will be made to contact these persons. Study conductors will collect these slips. Publishers can provide helpful information regarding previous attempts to call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (6 min.) Two publishers discuss how such calls should be made. Less experienced believes in getting right to the point, not wasting any time. He tells them they are no longer getting the magazine through the mail and he came by to renew their subscription. When asked about results obtained, he admits his method is not very effective. Alertness to circumstances and the need of being adaptable cannot be overstressed. The following possibilities should be considered: The person has (1) read and enjoyed the magazine but interest has not been followed up, (2) read magazine some but is not too interested, (3) not read at all, or (4) is not home and someone else comes to door. After analyzing different possibilities it is agreed that in every case interest should be rekindled, using regular sermon. Try to contact one who originally subscribed, if at all possible. If person has moved or is not at home, give sermon to person contacted. Less experienced appreciates need to have these points in mind. A suggested introduction is: ‘Good evening. My name is-----. Are you Mr(s). -----? [Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">name on slip.] The reason for my call is to obtain your opinion on the question, What is necessary to please God? Most persons feel that sincerity is all that is necessary. . . .’ On completion of sermon refer to specific article or point that would vitally interest householder and then say: ‘Interesting articles like this are coming in every issue and I would not want you to miss this valuable information. I have received this notice that your subscription has expired and I would be pleased to renew it for you.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (6 min.) Well-prepared publisher gives demonstration on how expired-subscription calls can be made using the regular sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Local experiences in obtaining renewals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">15 min: Active Ministers of God in Spite of Handicaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only those who are physically fit and unencumbered are invited to serve Jehovah. The privilege of applying the principle of the general priesthood as a servant of God is open to all who love him, as shown in these 1964 “Yearbook” experiences. Those confined to bed can share the comfort from God’s Word. (100 111) Even a blind inmate of a home for the aged can reflect the light of truth. (149 ffl) One who may not even be able to walk far from his own door can do much to spread the truth abroad. (209 fl2) Rather than allowing serious illness to prevent them from serving Jehovah, some find that when they exert themselves to share in the ministry their health improves. (256 ff2; 211 fl2) Strong love for Jehovah enables one to overcome apparently insurmountable obstacles. (121 fl2) Whether handicapped or not, are you a zealous preacher of the good news?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">18 min: Vacation Pioneer in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) As a result of fine response last April a mighty witness was given. Many had a joyful time serving as vacation pioneers; congregations benefited. Some in our congregation served as vacation pioneers. Let’s hear from them as to how they arranged to do so and what their intentions are for this April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">INTERVIEW (10 min.) Chairman interviews various ones. Select variety of persons, young ones, parents, older brothers, housewives, full-time workers, etc., who served as vacation pioneers in April. Discuss with each how he enjoyed vacation pioneering, how he was able to arrange his schedule and whether he plans on vacation pioneering this April. Keep discussion enthusiastic and lively and be brief with each one so as many as possible may be interviewed. If none in congregation served as vacation pioneers in April, use those who have served as vacation pioneers anytime, or check “Index” under “Vacation Pioneer” and use such experien-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Encourage all to vacation pioneer in April. Remind all that the overseer will meet with those interested in vacation pioneering Sunday, March 1, after the “Watchtower” study to help those interested in vacation pioneering to arrange their schedules, etc. Regular pioneers may be present at the meeting to offer suggestions. Special midweek field service arrangements will be made throughout April for vacation pioneers and publishers to join them in service. Prayerfully consider the vacation pioneer service and encourage one another. Applications are available from the overseer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FIND, FEED AND TENDERLY CARE FOR THE “OTHER SHEEP” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(John 21:15-17)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> From December 3 through January 4, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta and New York (Brooklyn Bethel) became host cities for four-and-a-half-day periods of intensified training for circuit and district servants in these areas. All the 313 circuit and district servants in the United States, as well as the 71 Canadian circuit and district servants, received timely and beneficial instruction from the Society’s president, as well as from two brothers from the United States Service Desk and two Gilead instructors. Classes were held in each city Tuesday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5:50 p.m., and on Saturday, 8 a.m, to 12 noon. The entire school dealt with things these servants as shepherds of God’s flock can do in giving help to all within their congregations, Circuit and district servants are now applying these helpful suggestions in the congregations. Since the effectiveness of what was discussed depends, not only upon what circuit and district servants do, but also upon the support and cooperation of all servants, publishers and pioneers, the Society thought it well to outline some of the things covered in this special school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">“WITH THE MOUTH ONE MAKES PUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">DECLARATION FOR SALVATION.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">z Jehovah has commanded his people to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Engaging in the ministry is actually a vital part of our worship of Jehovah, and we should do it because we want to do it. (Rom. 10:10) Never should we engage in the ministry just to have a report. We should share in the ministry with appreciation of our privilege of worshiping Jehovah and of sharing life-giving knowledge with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s Time and again it was emphasized at the school that publishers and pioneers, because of their love of the truth, want to spend as much time as possible in field service, not doing so just to build up a record on paper, but, rather, to lovingly care for the “sheep.” We know that someone spent time in the field, and that is how we were helped to know of Jehovah’s way of salvation for us. Babylon the Great has already fallen, and now is the time to boldly give a witness that will enable honesthearted lovers of Jehovah to flee from this world’s empire of false religion before it is too late. After Babylon the Great is completely destroyed in its fallen state, just before Armageddon, it will be too late to flee to Jehovah’s refuge. (Rev. 18:4) Therefore, now is the time to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">find, feed</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tenderly care for</span><span class="font11"> “other sheep” by telling all peoples to “Get out of her.” Constantly we must keep reminding ourselves, as we engage in the ministry, that lives are involved, ours and others’ also. Thus when we locate sheeplike individuals our only aim should be to start home Bible studies. We want them to learn the truth too and become praisers of Jehovah. In that way they can save their life! Our big work is conducting home Bible studies with sheeplike individuals and directing them to Jehovah’s organization. Time is running out. To help all in God’s congregations to fulfill their responsibility, the Society arranges to send the circuit servant approximately every four months. He has two main things to accomplish while with the congregation: to work with and train publishers in the field ministry and to check the organization to see that all activities are functioning properly. The refresher course for circuit and district servants was designed to aid each servant to accomplish these two things more effectively. They were shown how to be better teachers in the field and how to conduct the meetings with the servants and otherwise check on the organizing of congregation activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">VISIT OF CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT SERVANTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">•&gt; The visit of mature brothers to a congregation is nothing new. This arrangement was in existence for the benefit of the early Christian congregation. Peter, Paul, Timothy and many others visited congregations in the days of the early church to strengthen, encourage, set matters straight and to be a source of blessing to the congregations. (Acts 16:4, 5; 20:26-28; 2 Cor. 11:28) A similar arrangement is true today. The Society is pleased to have capable, mature brothers engaged in the circuit and district work, men who love Jehovah and his people and who have arranged to put Kingdom interests first in their lives so as to serve fully in behalf of their brothers. They are doing a fine work. The wives of circuit and district servants are doing excellent work too by aiding sisters and younger- publishers in field activity. This they do under the direction of their husbands, and this is very much appreciated by the Society and the congregation publishers. Look forward to each visit of your circuit and district servant as a provision from Jehovah through his organization. Support all the activities arranged for during the week. Do not deprive yourself of any of the special benefits to keep you strong spiritually and to aid you to accomplish your ministry fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">MINISTERIAL HOURS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s In 1961 field service hour averages for publishers were 9.6, in 1962 they were up to 9.7, and in 1963 they increased to 9.8. It is very pleasing to see this upward trend. With this steady increase, it is hoped that we will reach our goal of ten hours per publisher by the end of the service year. Talking the truth with others a minimum of ten hours each month is a very reasonable and wholesome goal. To this end the Society has encouraged all to have a weekly schedule that ensures our taking care of the ministry, as we also take care of other things in life. Circuit and district servants have aided thousands of publishers during the last two years to work out personal schedules in accord with their circumstances. They will continue to speak personally to publishers each week, helping them to work out schedules enabling them to spend at least ten hours in field service each month, finding, feeding and caring for the “sheep.” In between circuit servants’ visits, overseers and study conductors will also assist publishers to work out practical schedules. Individually, let us respond to this loving arrangement so that we can be assisted to have a greater share in the lifesaving work Jehovah has directed in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPORTING SERVICE CENTER ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s Most of our service is done through the service center arrangement. It is vital, therefore, that these centers be well organized and supported by the publishers, with the study conductor taking the lead. He must show a personal interest in the spiritual needs of each one associated. A good service center arrangement results in a strong congregation, and even when the work has to go underground in some countries, a well-organized, tightly-knit service center arrangement keeps the organization healthy and growing. The conductor’s preparing for and conducting the book study itself is a great privilege, and the study keeps the brothers alive spiritually. This is most important because it helps the publisher in his field service. Another privilege the servant of the service center has 1s working with and encouraging publishers to be in the field as much as possible and also helping them to improve their ministerial abilities. There is a real need for good leadership by study conductors. Circuit servants can help study conductors to be better teachers at the book study and in the field. The congregation overseer should see to it that the service centers are well organized, and this means he too must visit them regularly. Circuit servants will give considerable attention to service center arrangements on each visit to the congregation. It is indeed the course of wisdom and in the interest of your life to take advantage of all the arrangements at the service center. It will help you to grow to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> For your welfare support the study and the various meetings for field service from the service center. Whether the appointed study conductor is a brother or a sister, circuit servants will aid the conductor to organize ministerial activities more effectively and to build up support of these. The study conductor will be shown how he can aid each publisher within his group to be more active In the ministry. This often requires making a personal visit to the home of a publisher and giving him Scriptural encouragement. Help too will be needed in working out a schedule for each one to reach ten hours in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom, thus having a greater part in finding, feeding and tenderly caring for the “other sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">MIDWEEK FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s Many are finding that they can engage in midweek field service activity, and they are having wonderful results. Housewives and others schedule time during the day for the ministry. Often pioneers can assist others in this midweek work. It is suggested that all congregations ascertain which publishers and pioneers can share in this service. Find out when service can be arranged, whether in the morning or afternoon or both, one or two or more days during the week. Let all know of the arrangements so others can join them. Those sharing in service at these times can invite and encourage others to go with them, so as to build up midweek service. Such arrangements may help many to reach their ten-hour quota. In addition to sharing in this activity, those who possibly can will also want to support regular weekend activities with the service centers. Assist the many new and less experienced publishers who want to witness but do not know how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">LOW-HOUR, IRREGULAR AND INACTIVE PUBLISHERS TO BE ASSISTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s&gt;Many publishers are in need of encouragement and direction in their worship of Jehovah. The importance of assisting others was thoroughly discussed and demonstrated with the circuit and district servants. (Eccl. 4:11, 12; Rom. 15:1, 2; 1 Cor. 16:8; Phil. 2:4; 1 Pet. 5:2) The circuit servants will aid overseers and study conductors to put the assistance arrangement into operation more fully within the congregation. The assistance arrangement is a loving provision for more experienced publishers to give encouragement and assistance to those needing such in order to share in the ministry. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font11"> paragraph 22.) The assistance arrangement has as its purpose (1) to provide loving assistance and companionship to those who are having some difficulty in sharing regularly in the service alone and (2) to aid less experienced publishers to become more mature and appreciative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">m In each service center the study conductor should know who are being used in the assistance arrangement to assist others. The congregation overseer should work closely with the study conductor in keeping these arrangements up-to-date. A study conductor who is keenly interested in each one associated with his group will usually know who needs help and how to go about giving this. However, to facilitate this the assistant congregation servant will continue to provide the two lists each month, about the first and fifteenth days, to let the study conductor know who have not reported field service activity. When a person’s name shows up on one of these lists, the study conductor should immediately think who is assigned to assist this publisher and check with him. He will also be doing what he can week by week to help all in his group, making it his aim to work with all who are new or immature each month. With the study conductor and the mature ones in a group giving this regular help, we can be assured that there will be a greater maturity and increased activity along with less irregularity and even inactivity in the ministry. Circuit and district servants will give much attention to these arrangements in the service centers on future visits to the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ii To further assist irregular and inactive publishers the Society has adjusted the schedule of the circuit servant so he will be able to spend two hours each Wednesday evening making two or three calls on them with the overseer. What is his goal in making these calls? Irregular and inactive publishers generally need to be built up spiritually. Therefore an effort will first be made to help them attend meetings and resume personal study to build them up spiritually, and thereafter field service can be encouraged. The circuit servant will see if he can help with any problem that has caused some spiritual sickness and inactivity. It was emphasized that we not only want to find and feed more of the “other sheep” but also tenderly care for the ones Jehovah has already called from the darkness of this world into his marvelous light. Their lives are at stake, and every possible effort to save them should be made. (Gal. 6:10) Congregation servants will follow through on calls made with circuit servants and also help others who need assistance between visits of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 It was pointed out too how beneficial and appropriate it was for all the servants, with the exception of the congregation overseer, to be study conductors. Certainly the most mature brothers should be taking the lead in the service centers. Here is where the servant’s first obligation, to be a teacher in field service, can be discharged. For instance, if the assistant congregation servant is a book study conductor, this will enable him to give close attention to publishers in need of assistance. He can work with a service center for three or four months to build up field service activity and sermon capabilities of publishers. The circuit servant will spend some time with the assistant congregation servant, aiding him with appropriate suggestions that will, in turn, enable him to fulfill his special work with service centers. The overseer will visit all congregation book study centers as often as he can arrange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSIST YOUNGER PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">TO BE REGULAR IN SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is Younger publishers and their problems were also discussed. Many younger publishers are commendably spending ten or more hours in the ministry each month and, in addition, are doing well in their schoolwork, helping out at home and attending congregation meetings. The Society appreciates the wonderful work these young praisers of Jehovah are doing. One great aid to them in making their ministry more effective is the simplified sermons. Many younger publishers are using them well and some have advanced to using the full sermons quite effectively. Parents should help their children with schedules that will enable them to spend ten hours or more each month in the ministry as they give attention to their own schedules. Parents, listen to the presentations of your children to see that they are well prepared to work with the regular offer and do magazine work. Work with your children in field service from time to time. The Society feels that once your child comes to the point of taking up the ministry and appreciates this privilege of serving Jehovah and desires to report the ministerial activity, responsibility rests upon the young publisher and the parents to work together in seeing that the ministry is shared in regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>14</sup> Young publishers who are doing well with their presentations can do much to encourage and help other young publishers to engage in the ministry regularly and to improve their ministerial abilities. The more experienced younger publisher can by his example and loving assistance often aid many other young publishers. Provision should be made within the congregation for younger publishers to be assisted (1) within the family circle and (2) through the service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is Many new publishers are started during the months of December and April. Oftentimes there is a lack of follow-through, and, as a result, they publish irregularly or become inactive. When publishers or pioneers start new ones in field service, our work does not end there or when they are baptized. Continue to study the Bible with them and assist these to participate regularly in the service. Do this as long as it takes to bring them on to maturity. Overseers and study conductors should see that the needs of newer ones are met. Publishers who start new ones in service should be encouraged to follow through in helping the new ones advance to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLISHERS WHO MOVE TO OTHER CONGREGATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is it has been observed that a number of publishers moving from one congregation to another become inactive. Often this is true of newer publishers who fail to associate with the new congregation when moving to another area and, as a result, become spiritually sick. Congregation servants should ascertain the new address of those publishers who move. If the address of the new congregation is not known by the overseer, he can write the Society a short note giving the name and address of the one(s) moving, and this information will be sent by the Society to the new congregation. Those moving should take along their Publisher’s Record Cards; but if they forget to do so, these can be sent along with the congregation servant’s letter to the Society. Undoubtedly, as loving calls are made on these publishers soon after they move, much will be done to aid them to continue uninterrupted worship and service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">BACK-CALL AND BIBLE STUDY WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J? It is vital to engage in house-to-house ministry to find the “other sheep.” (Acts 20:20) As a result of our house-to-house ministry last year, plus incidental witnessing, over 19 million pieces of literature and 116 million magazines were placed, which is excellent. We will want to continue our fine house-to-house ministry to locate those who need help to get out of Babylon the Great. But, In addition, we will want to increase our share in the back-call and Bible study work. Why? Because we </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not only want to find</span><span class="font11"> the “sheep” but </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">also want to</span><span class="font11"> feed </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">them and tenderly care for them. </span><span class="font11">—John 21:15-17; Acts 15:36; Gal. 6: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is To illustrate the importance of back-call and Bible study work, it would be well for each congregation servant to determine the total pieces of literature placed in the field by publishers and pioneers during the last service year. Then the question can be propounded: Even though hundreds or thousands of pieces of literature were placed, how many people in our territory who received literature took the initiative to come to the Kingdom Hall or call a publisher asking for assistance? Most congregations will have no such experiences. There are very few persons who take literature and seek assistance to study it. All of this emphasizes our responsibility to fulfill the ministry in accord with Matthew 28:19, 20, which tells us to make disciples of people of all nations. To make disciples of others and to teach them to observe all things commanded requires starting and conducting Bible studies. Here really is the ultimate goal of our field ministry. Each publisher should work with the goal in mind of starting and conducting at least one home Bible study, regular pioneers seven and special pioneers ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">is Bible study servants will be assisted by circuit servants to help more to share in this vital activity. As pointed out in the August 1963 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> the Bible study servant as a book study conductor will be able to build up especially the back-call and Bible study work as he takes the lead in field service. He will aid publishers to make back-calls and start studies. Likewise he will encourage publishers, servants and pioneers who enjoy good success in this work to aid others to get into this joyful and most important feature of our ministry. Checking the Publisher’s Record Cards will give him the information he needs to do this. After working with a study group several months and helping those in that center to take up the back-call and Bible study work, he will be moved by the overseer to another center. The mature publishers sharing in midweek service can help those who need assistance to make back-calls and start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2&lt;</sup>5 Some have asked if it is all right for publishers to start studies Sunday morning if this is the time desired by the householder. There Is no objection to this, because the purpose and goal of our house-to-house ministry is to find and feed the “sheep.” Conduct Bible studies whenever they can be held. It is preferable for publishers to spend two hours in house-to-house work on Sunday and thereafter have a Bible study, adding up to three hours in service. If one cannot stay out three hours or if a householder would like to study earlier, there Is no objection, for studies should be arranged and conducted at the most convenient time. Some publishers spend an hour or so in house-to-house work and then conduct two Bible studies on Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2i In addition to the Bible study servant’s taking the lead In the back-call and Bible study work with the service center, he will encourage greater support of the back-call evening from all service centers. Some conductors have become discouraged due to poor support of the back-call evening. It was pointed out at the refresher course that conductors can really only work with one Individual at a time and the other publishers will do the best they can making back-calls until they get the needed assistance. Conductors should make appointments in advance and encourage other mature ones to do the same in back-call work. As studies are started, publishers can go right to their Bible studies that evening instead of coming to the service center first. Usually it is more convenient to go directly to the study and it will save time for publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY STUDIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 Many publishers and servants now commendably have studies with their undedicated children. Scriptural-ly, parents have the responsibility to bring up their children in ths discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah, and, of course, all parents are encouraged to study with their children. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:1-4) There is no objection to field service time being counted by one member of the family conducting a family study. One Bible study may be reported and also the back-calls. The study should be conducted regularly each week for best results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23 Some family studies are now being conducted at a time that interferes with the public preaching efforts of the congregation. The Society would like to suggest that family studies be conducted as much as possible on Monday night, which is a night available to most publishers. Bethel families around the world spend Monday nights studying' </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> together and thereafter have a ministry school. By having family studies Monday night the brothers are not restricted from supporting congregational activities. Where families for some reason cannot have the study on Monday night, they are encouraged to select another time that will not take them out of the public ministry. In addition to conducting a family study the Society urges all dedicated persons who conduct a family study also to conduct a study with someone apart from the family. One of our Scriptural responsibilities is to care for our families, but we must also preach the good news of the Kingdom publicly so as to find and feed the “other sheep.” If all conducting family studies will extend their Bible study activity to include ha.ving a study with the public, much more will be accomplished in accord with Matthew 28:19, 20. Circuit servants will check Publisher’s Record Cards as well as the Bible study file on this and encourage those conducting a family study to also con-, duct studies with the public. The Bible study servant will also follow through and encourage support of this suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT SERVANTS TO HELP STIMULATE MORE BACK-CALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">AND BIBLE STUDY WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2i There are now 313 circuit and district servants in the United States. If each one starts two studies a week, a total of 626 studies will be started each week. With these brothers and their wives also starting two Bible studies each, over 1,200 studies will be started each week. This amounts to almost 5,000 studies a month. It is a pleasure to say that many who are now publishing and who are even servants were previously helped in this way by circuit and district servants or their wives, with publishers continuing the study. Before starting house-to-house work, circuit and district servants and their wives will ascertain when the publishers they work with are available to take care of a study. Thus if a Bible study is started while they are working with a publisher it can be turned over to him. In addition to starting the study, they will try wherever possible to conduct a second study before the week is up, taking along the one who will conduct the study. It would be good to encourage publishers to arrange to have such studies scheduled on the following visit so the circuit servant can attend the study on his next visit to see the progress being made by the individual with whom the study was started, as well as offer help to the publisher conducting the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 when the circuit servant visits your congregation, if you do not have a study for him to attend with you, then have some definite back-calls or expiration slips lined up. For regular back-calls ascertain beforehand if the people are going to be home. Circuit and&quot; district servants and their wives are pleased to turn over studies that they start. Often this can be done in connection with afternoon activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONS STUDIED WITH WHO MOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 It has been noted that many well-established Bible studies move and interest lies dormant due to lack of follow-through. If possible ascertain the new address of the person of goodwill. If the congregation servant of the next congregation is not known, a note can be sent to the Society giving the name and the address to which the person has moved. Enclose the up-to-date Study Record for the study and give other useful information. These will be forwarded to the next congregation so capable publishers can call on the person of goodwill and resume the study quickly. Undoubtedly this provision will aid in helping many interested persons to continue to receive the spiritual food they need to grow to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">27 Truly the Bible study work is the high point of our field ministry. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font11"> paragraph 101; Acts 17:11, 12; 1 Cor. 3:6) House-to-house work enables us to find interested persons, but it is through the Bible study activity that they are aided to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. All publishers, both young and old, are encouraged to be Bible-studyconscious. Remember the goal of at least one Bible study with the public per publisher. Circuit and district servants will emphasize the Bible study work and give appropriate encouragement for more to share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE ACTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">28 Magazine service is a very important provision to keep the message of the Kingdom before the people in the territory. The proper view of magazine activity also enables us to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">find, feed and care for</span><span class="font11"> the “other sheep.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">29 Magazine averages for publishers in the United States have dropped from 12 in 1960 to 11.6 in 1962 and on down to 11.4 in 1963. Are magazines harder to place? No, not with propel’ preparation and use of short, appealing 30- to 60-second presentations. Circuit and district servants report that placements are generally good except where publishers call saying only, “I have the latest copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span><span class="font11"> A good presentation means highlighting one article in one of the journals. Effective presentations really stimulate interest in the article, which, of course, will move people to read the life-giving information contained in the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW SCHEDULE FOR CIRCUIT SERVANTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MAGAZINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAINING</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">so Circuit servants will now have the opportunity to work with six different publishers on Saturday morning and six in the afternoon, making a total of twelve. The same is true of his wife. This means the two of them will be able to work with 24 publishers and assist them in effectively presenting magazines on Magazine Day. In addition to aiding publishers to have good presentations, he will also show publishers how magazine routes can be developed and kept going. Publishers and pioneers who have magazine routes generally do not fall short of reaching the suggested quota. However, until one gets acquainted with the householders on the route, it is good to make a notation of the age and circumstances of the individuals, such as “middle-aged, mother with two children,” and so forth, and then an article of interest can be selected to whet the appetite of that person. Preparing individualized presentations results in fine magazine routes. Not infrequently magazine routes result in Bible studies being started, aiding us to further feed and tenderly care for the “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">si Circuit servants will work with magazine-territory servants for at least an hour and preferably two hours during the next few visits on Magazine Day. This will give circuit servants an opportunity to pass on suggestions for effectively placing magazines and also demonstrating how to start magazine routes and keep them going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">32 Circuit servants will kindly help magazine-territory servants to appreciate the necessity of ordering extra magazines for this special week for the congregation so publishers and pioneers will be able to support magazine service fully on the visit of the circuit servant to the congregation. There are other special campaigns throughout the year he will plan for also, such as distribution of special issues of the magazines and holiday witnessing. If the magazine-territory servant runs out of magazines every week, he should be ordering more magazines so he has some for special calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">33 The main privilege of service for the magazine-territory servant is taking the lead in field activity, helping publishers to share in magazine work. Circuit servants will take the Publisher’s Record Cards and show this servant how to determine which publishers are effective in placing magazines as well as ones in need of assistance. He will help the magazineterritory servant to see how publishers and pioneers successful in placing magazines can be used to aid others. Both morning and afternoon meetings for field service can be arranged for Magazine Day, according to the needs of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">34 Circuit servants will also aid this servant to organize Magazine Day so publishers who respond will have sufficient territory and magazines to work for the time available. Often it is reported that after a short time publishers run out of territory and go home. Others run out of magazines and go home. Good organization will enable publishers to stay in the field longer and enjoy a greater share in this splendid work. In addition to house-to-house magazine work, publishers who do street work are encouraged to take the initiative to approacli window-shoppers, those waiting for buses, those seated in autos, and so forth. Shopping centers or plazas are excellent for placing magazines. Often men sit in their cars waiting for their wives who are doing their shopping and they are pleased to have something to read. Why not take advantage of opportune times to do magazine work in such areas? Anytime is magazine time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as Now and again in magazine -work a person contributes 25c or more and expresses his desire to have the money used to further the work. As a suggestion you could reply, ‘We do appreciate your kindness and in turn would like to do something for you. These magazines are published every two weeks. When the next issues are available it would be my pleasure to bring them to you, as you have already paid for them.’ This is an excellent way to aid persons to see we are truly interested in them, and by calling with the next two issues you may start a route. Fine experiences have resulted from handling extra contributions this way and many individuals giving the contribution are now on regular magazine routes or are subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">BUSINESS TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">36 Oftentimes businessmen have little opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. Much witnessing is done during the week, at which time they are at their place of business, and, of course, the same is true on Saturdays. Even if they are at home on Sunday, the wife often comes to the door. Thus the opportunities to witness to businessmen are few. It would be a fine thing for congregations to work the business territory at least with magazines. Circuit and district servants will take the lead in this work when with congregations. All who do store-to-store work report it to be a most satisfying work, with more placements resulting than in any other feature of service. Store-to-store work with magazines has been the means whereby many businessmen have learned the truth. Circuit and district servants will be pleased to train publishers in store-to-store work on Saturday and in developing magazine routes in such territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a? When special articles appear in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> dealing with specialized things such as the police department, fire department, chiropractors, obstetricians, legal cases, and so forth, it would be well for the magazine-territory servant and other well-qualified publishers to contact businessmen in special fields with these magazines. The articles dealing with specialized fields are very appealing and are published for the welfare of businessmen and officials as well as those whom we meet in our regular ministry. Use of magazines in this way has opened up many fine opportunities and privileges of service and a better understanding and appreciation of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses by many businessmen, some of whom are dealt with in arranging for circuit assemblies, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as All publishers should conscientiously try to place at least 12 magazines each month, pioneers' 100 and special pioneers 150. Magazine placements provide an excellent means of keeping the message of the Kingdom before people but, most of all, help us to further find, feed and tenderly care for the “other sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">39 The importance of giving more careful attention to a systematic coverage of territory was also demonstrated to circuit and district servants. Our obligation is to try to reach the occupants of every home with the good news, and our goal is to cover territory every four months or at least every six months. The magazineterritory servant must use his file wisely to make assignments and make recommendations of territory to be covered according to the need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER MINISTRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">JO in dealing with field service no report would be complete without some comment on the pioneer service. Two years ago there were around 6,000 regular pioneers and the number has now increased to over 8,000. For the last seventeen months we have had new peaks in the number of regular pioneers each month, which is excel-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Attend Talks at the Congregation Book Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Every month or so each congregation enjoys 45-minute talks at the congregation book studies. These are wonderful occasions deserving our wholehearted support. What subjects should be discussed on these occasions? In addition to the current public talk series, the subjects of any of the previous years may be used as well as subjects from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.”</span><span class="font11"> This provides a variety of well over 200 topics, which is ample source material.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> As to the speakers used on these occasions, the brothers should have the same qualifications as those giving hour talks. It would be improper to view the 45-minute talks as training for brothers who may eventually give hour lectures. Those giving 45-minute talks should be fine teachers, for they are speaking to small groups. This calls for added friendliness and warmth coupled with an enthusiastic delivery appropriate to the location. In this way, excellent material can be properly presented for the benefit of our brothers and persons of goodwill, and each month the brothers will look forward to these occasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What about prayer at these meetings? As pointed out in paragraph 147 of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity:</span><span class="font11"> “Public meetings in any location should not be opened or closed with prayer.” Thus prayer</span></p>

All will want to give them special distribution. Publishers will want to plan to place at least ten of each special issue, pioneers 50 of each, and special pioneers 65 of each. Congregations should ascertain their needs and order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our 20-percent goal for April is 336,062 publishers. Now is the time to start working toward it by laying the foundation to take those with whqm studies are being conducted and who are sufficiently advanced out in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Sunday, March 1, after the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study, congregation servants will hold a special meeting with all publishers interested in vacation pioneering in April. If applications are needed, they should be ordered right away. The purpose of the meeting will be to encourage and assist ones thinking of vacation pioneering to work out schedules, service arrangements and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Correction: In the January </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> it was suggested that, where householders do not take a subscription, publishers might offer the three booklets on a contribution of 15c. This should have been 10c.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">is not offered even at the end of the 15-minute study in the book, which is regarded as a demonstration of the manner in which the study is ordinarily conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the occasion of these 45-minute talks, it is advisable for study conductors to be present at their respective congregation book studies. Why? Because the study conductor will get better acquainted with those in attendance, will learn more about those with whom studies are being conducted and thus be in the best position to help them. Also, it will give him an opportunity to accompany persons of goodwill or those with whom he is studying to the talk. He can hardly do this if assigned to give a talk elsewhere that evening. Therefore, it may not be best to have all the talks on one evening. Schedules can be made up so that some talks are held each week, if necessary, and this will allow the study conductor to be present when a visiting brother gives the talk. When the study conductor travels to another location to give a talk, his assistant can conduct the study that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Publishers should he advised at least a week ahead of time so they can invite people of goodwill to the 45-minute talks. These talks have already accomplished a tremendous amount of good. Undoubtedly this will increase as speakers continue to work for improvement and publishers lend their full support in the many ways open to them.</span></p>

In addition, the special pioneer work has increased nicely too. In 1961 we averaged 603. For the 1963 service year the monthly average was 694. As to vacation pioneering the response has been truly outstanding. The Society is very pleased to see the excellent response to the vacation, regular and special pioneer service.. Circuit and district servants were encouraged to continue lovingly aiding individuals to take up the pioneer service and to make room for it in their lives. They will not only spend time with pioneers, helping them with their field problems, but also will encourage them to continue in this fine service of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pioneers can be a great blessing to congregations by taking the lead in midweek service, aiding and encouraging publishers to increase their ministry, as well as supporting weekend activities. On the other hand, some pioneers who are low in ma,gazine placements, Bible studies or other features of the ministry can be aided by other pioneers or publishers who have good results in these particular features of the ministry. If assistance is given to pioneers to build up weak features of their ministry, they, in turn, will be able to assist other publishers with whom they work in Jehovah’s service. Congregation committees are finding the material in the Society’s letter of September 15, 1963, stimulating and helpful to coordinate pioneer and congregation activities. Circuit and district servants will remind committees to make regular reference to this letter to aid pioneers in the congregation. The arrangement for pioneers to be a part of the congregation has resulted in great spiritual blessings for both pioneers and congregations. Pioneers, servants and all publishers will want to cooperate closely so as to be a real source of encouragement to one another. Circuit and district servants will be a help to congregations and pioneers in this regard on their visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>42</sup> It is gratifying to say that many circuit and district servants who attended the school in the various cities throughout the United States and have since served congregations have already written the Society saying how much more effective they feel their visits to the congregations are and how much more they are able to assist publishers and servants. (Prov, 2!7:23J Look forward to the next visit of your circuit and district servant to an even greater extent, brothers, fully appreciating that these brothers are interested in aiding you to worship Jehovah faithfully and to do so more effectively. AU together and in unbroken unity we will want to have the fullest possible share in finding, feeding and tenderly caring for the “other sheep” in these critical days before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">‘TEACH TO OBSERVE ALL THINGS’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our work as Christian witnesses of Jehovah is to save lives, not only our own but others’ also. So, then, let us all keep busy in the service of our God, doing what Jesus said we should do,. ‘make disciples, baptize them, teaching them the things I have commanded you.’—Matt. 28:19^ 20.</span></p>

If this objection comes up often in our territory, we may find it advantageous to bring up the subject before the householder does. After introducing ourself and the theme of our Bible sermon, we might say. ‘You no doubt have a religious affiliation of your own.’ (Allow householder to answer. He will often tell you what his religion is.) Then we can continue, 'I assumed that you did. Most people we talk to are associated with a religious organization. The purpose of my call, however, is to answer an important Bible question and encourage more home use of the Bible.’ (Then go right on with the sermon. The matter of different religions has been cleared up and the householder’s mind will be at ease.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Joy is ours when we servo Jehovah. And how forcefully that fact is driven home when we consider some of the marvelous features of December’s report. Think of it, despite the winter’s cold and other hardships that come with the season, our brothers averaged 9.1 hours in service, placed an average of 10.3 magazines and made 3.1 back-calls on persons who showed interest in the Kingdom message. Perhaps even more rewarding is the fact that 297,007 publishers shared in the ministry, praising Jehovah, and this is the second-highest report on record. It thrills us to see this 6.1-percent increase over last year’s average of 280,052 Kingdom proclaimers. How Jehovah’s heart must rejoice to see so many putting forth effort to declare his name and purpose! (Prov. 27:11) Now let us lovingly help the many new ones to continue appreciating this privilege of making declaration for salvation, and doing so with boldness.—Rom. 10: 8-10; Acts 4: 31.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">work, the introduction suggested in the December </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font11">may bring good results, but occasionally we meet the above objection. We might then respond, ‘May I ask what your religion is?’ After getting the householder’s reply we can continue, ‘I am glad to know. We often have the pleasure of talking to others of your religion, and we would be happy to have your expression on the matter of sincerity. Many people have expressed the thought that to please God it does not matter what you believe so long as you are sincere.’ (Invite comment from householder and continue with sermon.) By acknowledging the objection and then endeavoring to absorb it into our presentation, we can usually continue with the sermon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is also heartening to see that appreciation for the pioneer service is constantly increasing among Jehovah’s people. For the seventeenth month in a row we have had a new peak in the number of regular pioneers! December also saw 738 special pioneers in the field—another new peak! And 3,489 arranged their affairs to be vacation pioneers during the month. We rejoice with you in your excellent work. May Jehovah keep on blessing you one and all as you rejoice before him, “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> April is truly a month of special activity for all of Jehovah’s people. Each one of us will want to arrange a schedule that will permit us to have more than the usual share in Kingdom service during April. Yes, let us look to Jehovah to bless our efforts to have more publishers in the field this April, spend more time in the ministry, make more back-calls, conduct more Bible studies and place more literature than any other time. With fine response to this call for vacation pioneers in April and with Jehovah’s blessing, we will do it again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Vacation pioneers helped many new and less mature publishers to share in April service.” “Many publishers spent more time in service as a result of encouragement from vacation pioneers.” To be sure, the 10,379 vacation pioneers contributed much to what happened last April.

<p><span class="font11"><sup></sup> Many who served as April vacation pioneers enjoyed it so much that they extended their time as vacation pioneers.

Also during the past year a number of slips have been sent out, and in many cases no contact has yet been made with the former subscriber. So it would be well for all of us to look through our things and search out expired-subscription slips, regardless of the expiration date shown. We should bring these to the service center Sunday morning, February 16. Study conductors will organize the service center so calls are made on all these former subscribers. If not all are contacted that day, then study conductors will see that the group follows through until all former subscribers have been called on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As we thoroughly explore all the avenues of subscription opportunities, we will, of course, meet persons who already subscribe and those who do not wish to subscribe. Those who do not subscribe can be offered two magazines for 10c or the three booklets that were displayed with the subscription offer, for 10c. When you find persons who already subscribe for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font11">offer them the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font11"> book.

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Be Trained by Discipline for Yielding Fruit</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As we have learned from the Bible, all of us need discipline if we are to produce the two kinds of fruitage God requires of Christians. So we appreciate God’s discipline, his training, since it will enable us to bring forth the fruitage of the spirit, also Kingdom fruitage, as we keep busy preaching the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Certainly before any of us can aid others to bear this fruitage, we must help them to get free from Great Babylon. To help us to do this, Jehovah has blessed us with a wonderful instrument—the eyeopening book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </span><span class="font13">Since we know that divine doom awaits all who continue captive to Great Babylon, we realize that this work of liberation is urgent. So how glad we are to have the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book and the opportunity to use it now In our ministry I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> You will be happy to know that the Society has received quite a number of warm letters of appreciation for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book, even from persons who are not regularly associated with Jehovah’s organization. They have not found the material in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book beyond their ability to grasp but have been delighted by its stimulating verse-by-verse discussion of prophecies in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and Revelation. So you can feel confident about offering it to the people at the door, knowing that it is something from which they will be able to benefit personally. It can help them to act now, to flee from Babylon the Great for their lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-Discipline to Bear More Fruitage</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As we help liberate others with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book, we want to put forth earnest effort to be trained by discipline ourselves. You can show self-discipline, for example, by being on time Sunday morning at the service center. And if you are the one in charge, start the meeting for service on time. It should not last more than fifteen minutes. Then we can all proceed immediately to the field so we can get the most accomplished.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> You can show discipline, too, by sticking to your schedule, which will enable you to spend at least two and a half hours each week in the field ministry. The weekend is not the only time for service. Many publishers include midweek witnessing in their schedule, perhaps working as a group. If you have done this in your congregation during April, why not keep on doing it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">'&gt; And as you seek to be trained by discipline, do not forget to train the new ones who started in April, You can help them with the simplified sermon for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book or with a magazine presentation. With encouragement, they, too,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Response for Vocation Pioneering—Excellent!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The Society would like to commend the nearly 12,000 publishers who submitted applications for vacation pioneer service during March. Last March the number who submitted applications was a little over 9,000.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It is most gratifying to see such fine response. It indicates that many more of you see the need for</span></p></li></ul><img src="km_E_196405_files/km_E_196405-2.png" alt="" style="width:141pt;height:33pt;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!' Gad's Kingdom Rules!” and a booklet, for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Trained by Discipline for Yielding Fruit.—Heb. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">giving more attention to Kingdom interests. This is certain to bring forth blessings in many ways. Why not be numbered among the increasing crowd of vacation pioneers and recipients of many benefits who say: “Vacation pioneering has meant much to our family,” “I did not know it was so wondercan become productive ministers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> If you keep in mind the goal of aiding others to praise Jehovah, then whenever you place the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon </span><span class="font13">book, you will leave a booklet and try to start a study—perhaps in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Look!</span><span class="font13"> booklet. Since Bible studies are the ideal way to train others to bring forth the two kinds of spiritual fruitage, Bible study servants should put forth special efforts this month to go with publishers who do not have studies and help them to start studies. Also, pioneers and capable publishers should be called on to assist others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> So a great work of liberation is before us; let us share in it fully. Jehovah will bless us for our being trained by discipline to yield fruit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">ful,” “Vacation pioneering has increased my appreciation for the truth”? We encourage all of you to give serious and prayerful consideration to serving at least once each year as a vacation pioneer. You will be glad you did, and say, as one sister did, “I have experienced many blessings as never before in my life. Please extend my vacation pioneer service.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> While the month of April will be over by the time you receive this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> any who can are invited to extend their period of vacation pioneer service. A letter setting forth the additional period you would like to vacation pioneer is all that is necessary. We also nvite you to consider joining the regular pioneer ranks. Ask your congregation committee, or your circuit servant when he visits your congregation, for help to arrange your schedule. Refer to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> supplement for December, 1962, on “How to Become a Pioneer” and plan to be a regular pioneer soon!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">10 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “ ‘Extra’ Magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Starting Studies in the “Look!” booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Many studies have been started with aid of “Look!” booklet. Place it with the “Babylon” book and use it well in starting studies with interested persons. A logical transition from sermon exists. See how publisher handles situation on first b A.ek—c</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span><span class="font12">ll</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (8 min.) Publisher renews acquaintance with householder, then states, “Last time we discussed how God will bring an end to Babylon and false worship and will unite all believing mankind in his promised new system of things. He has assured he will ‘make all things new.’ ” Publisher draws attention to cover of “Look!” booklet, reads Revelation 21:4, 5 and shows that such happiness will result when there is no more death and false religion. Then reads message from “The Publishers” inside front cover, considers first few paragraphs, reading the questions, then the paragraphs, after discussing the answers to the questions. Suggests that householder read scriptures on page 4 during the week. Arranges for return visit to continue discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) While simplified sermon can be used on back-calls to start studies, many will start studies on initial call. Watch publisher who has just placed offer start study on initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (4 min.) Publisher asks householder for a few more minutes to illustrate how “Look!” booklet can be used in Bible study. [If convenient to step in, do so.] Having just discussed Revelation 21:4, draws householder's attention to front cover of booklet as illustration of fulfillment of scripture and then proceeds the same as in Scene I. Chairman stopes presentation when publisher get's into message from “The Publishers. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encourages all to follow suggestions and start studies. 10 min: Concluding comments. (Include brief comment on slogan at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">15 min; Talk on “Using Vacations to Praise Jehovah.” Concentrate on “Yearbook” experiences to illustrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Vacations afford fine opportunities for praising Jehovah, in addition to providing needed recreation. Youthful publishers can use school vacations to praise Jehovah. (90 112) Using a vacation from secular work to vacation pioneer brings joy and blessings. (204 H2) Is it possible for your entire family to vacation pioneer? If so, you will have a most rewarding vacation. (221 112) Servants who try vacation pioneering will be recommending it to others even more heartily. (175 112) Some publishers may be able to use vacations to cover outlying areas, using tourist camps as a base. (279 fi3, 4) A vacation that makes time for praising Jehovah will be most refreshing and stimulating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min; Vacation Pioneer This Summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Many young publishers will be in an excellent position to vacation pioneer this summer. Parents are encouraged to work with them when possible. Servants, too, are encouraged to vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (5 min.) Father and mother discuss how much more they enjoy field service when they are out regularly, and observe that their children do too. Plan to encourage their children to vacation pioneer this summer. “It would be best if we could work along with them.” Mother did last summer. Would like to again as it gives her such a splendid opportunity to work right along with the children, giving commendation and help. Father observes that, while some of his vacation will be spent in attending the convention, he can vacation pioneer with family during the rest of it. Both will discuss it with children and complete arrangements. Will bring family together more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Excellent that parents take initiative in discussing it together and then with children. Much more accomplished if families work together as this family does. Some families may even be able to vacation pioneer together in unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are others who need encouragement too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (5 min.) Study conductor approaches and commends publisher for fine field service activity. He answers that it is the result of working with Brother Mature from time to time. Asked if he will vacation pioneer this summer, he replies, ‘Oh, no. I’ve been waiting all year for this vacation and a chance for recreation.’ Servant assures, ‘You can do both’; discusses reasonable schedule. Start early each day, spending three or four hours in field service in the morning. Have all afternoon off for recreation. Publisher pleased and encouraged as schedule takes shape. Says, ‘I could probably get Brother Willing to pioneer with me.’ Servant reminds that both he and ‘Brother Willing’ could work with the publishers who do midweek service, too. Publisher glad for suggestion as he will be putting Kingdom interests first, growing to spiritual maturity, and still have plenty of time for other things. Appreciates balanced view. Will get application from congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Encourage all who can to vacation pioneer, putting Kingdom interests first. All in congregation, young and old alike, will want to work together, having full share in summer field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What one must do to live under better system of things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 17:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. Suggested introduction and transitions: “In these days when sickness, death, delinquency and disunity among people are the major items of the news, I would like to brighten your day by showing you briefly the Bible’s promise of better conditions to come on earth. Certainly you would enjoy receiving good news for a change, isn’t that true? Revelation 21:3, 4 gives this good news. [Read and comment on it.] You may wonder, though, how this can come about in view of the seemingly permanent gloomy conditions on earth. It can only be through the power of God. His promised remedy is clearly stated here at Psalm 37:10, 11. [Read and comment.] To be among the righteous, the Bible shows here at John 17:3 the need for knowledge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ. [Read and comment.] For the purpose of helping you to take in knowledge of God and his promises, we are encouraging the reading of the Bible in modern English. You may have this copy of the ‘New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures’ for $1. With the Bible we are leaving a copy of ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ which is an aid to studying the Bible.” After placing Bible, demonstrate study of booklet.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“EXTRA” MAGAZINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The, Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">have been real aids in finding and feeding the “sheep.” Last year we distributed over 50 million magazines here in the United States. Think of the good that can be done if we continue to increase our distribution of these two fine journals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> From time to time the Society has small quantities of the current edition of the magazine left over after all the distributors’ orders have been mailed out. We would like to see these “EXTRA” magazines put to good use. The Society will therefore be sending “EXTRA” copies of each issue of the magazine to some of the congregations without charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> These “EXTRA” magazines will be sent with the word “EXTRA” printed on the top margin of the label. These will be mailed right after all distributors’ orders have been filled, and these should arrive a few days after your regular supply is received. The “EXTRA” quantity will be about 10 percent of your regular order. Even though you will not be charged for these</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Attend 1964 District Assemblies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> By this time you probably know which one of the district assemblies you will be attending this summer. We all know the importance of attending an assembly, enjoying fellowship with our brothers and taking in the rich spiritual food provided to strengthen us as ministers for Jehovah’s name, so we are looking forward to the assemblies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> At the time of mailing of this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> the Society is sending your Room Request forms. You will want to consider the instructions on the form carefully, and you can do this at a service meeting six to eight weeks prior to the assembly in your area. Mail these completed forms, not to the Society, but to the city where you expect to attend. The address for your assembly city is listed on the back side of the lower portion of the Room Request form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Volunteer Service forms are also being sent to your congregation. All of you who desire to assist and serve your brothers at the assembly will want to fill out the form completely. Then give the form to your congregation servant, who will sign it and mail it to your convention city. As you well know, there is a great deal of work required for the successful functioning</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">magazines on the monthly statement, they may be placed with the brothers on the regular contribution basis. This money may then be applied to your magazine account.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> If your congregation is able to place these magazines with ease, it may be that you will want to increase your regular distributors’ order a little bit. “EXTRA” copies will not be sent to you regularly, but only when we have “EXTRA” copies and your turn comes up. So your current needs should be covered by your regular distributors’ order. Do not expect these regularly. We will send only our overprint. If your congregation is not able to place the “EXTRA” copies received in the regular magazine work, they may be left in rest homes, prisons or other institutions. In this way the magazines will be giving a witness even though not placed on a contribution basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> By encouraging the brothers in your congregation to put forth a special effort using magazines when this supply is received, it will be possible to build up your magazine distribution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">of an assembly. So consider your volunteering for service a joyful privilege of assisting your brothers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It would be a good idea if you referred again to the April </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> where the Society made recommendations, suggesting that those living in certain circuits attend the cities designated so that the facilities will adequately and comfortably accommodate all of us who attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Those who speak Spanish will be glad to know that the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, assembly will have an all-Spanish program. San Bernardino, California, and Austin, Texas, will also have complete Spanish programs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> You can assist in advertising the assembly en route to the convention city by obtaining and wearing an attractive lapel card. This will fit the holder you have been using for conventions. Congregation servants, be sure to order the cards and celluloid holders to accommodate the needs of your congregation. The cards cost 1 cent each, and the celluloid holders 5 cents each. If you need them, you can also order cards printed in Spanish. We will not have any car bumper signs this year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page !/, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN EXPOSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You will be interested to know that the May 8 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">has a strong expose of the responsibility of the Roman Catholic Church, and particularly Pope Pius XII, in connection with the extermination of millions of Jews and others by Nazi Germany during World War II. It also makes clear that the other religious systems of Babylon the Great are acting in a similar way by their close cooperation with oppressive political governments. The matter has become a topic of current discussion because of the forceful stage play “The Deputy” now being presented in several countries. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> presents the facts. It is our hope that it will help to open the eyes of many honest-hearted persons. If you can use extra copies, order them now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Pioneer meal tickets for regular pioneers have been sent to those on the list since January 1. Treat the tickets as money. Do not lose them, as no replacements are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations interested in unassigned territory are requested to have their application submitted by May 15. «$► Each congregation has been sent a copy of the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum on Procedure of Jehovah's Witnesses Under Selective Service.</span><span class="font12"> Brothers of draft age who have dealings with the draft should see the overseer for use of the booklet. The Society is not sending out personal copies to all who have dealings with the draft. Generally the one copy sent to the congregation will suffice. If an additional copy is needed due to a congregation’s having many brothers of draft age, the overseer may submit an order, enclosing 25c for a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society still has a stock of the 1963 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> volumes and the 1964 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> for any who wish to order additional copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Saturday, May 30, worldly Memorial Day, will be a special magazine day. Congregations will arrange a morning and an afternoon meeting for service. At cemeteries we will feature the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article &quot;Why Do Men Die?’’ A tract such as “Hope for the Dead” may be used when magazines are not taken.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Simplified Sermon for “Babylon” Book Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> So that those of you who are new and younger publishers will be able to have a full share in offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book the following simplified sermons have been prepared. More experienced publishers will also endeavor to use a simplified sermon when busy householders are encountered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. [Offer additional appropriate local greeting.] The purpose of my brief visit is to direct attention to the command given in the Bible at Revelation 18:4. There we are told: [Read.] In order to comply with this command one would have to know just what Babylon the Great represents and also why it is so necessary to ‘get out of her.’ This Bible-study aid </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font13"> will help you to understand not only the identity of Babylon the Great but also why God has pronounced this adverse judgment against her. You may have this copy for a contribution of just 75 cents.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Ministry School Questions Answered</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We are all happy with the new theocratic ministry school schedule, but new programs may give rise to questions. Some questions on the new arrangement are answered here.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Sermons on written review night, even if assigned to a brother, should be presented to someone else assigned by the school servant. Sisters should always speak to another on the platform, although they may be assigned any talk if there is a shortage of brothers. It is usually better for the brother assigned talk number five not to speak to the entire audience as though he were talking to just one person. And if, in talk number five, the audience is to represent a group other than those in the school, the school servant may briefly announce the setting. In introducing the talks, the school servant should announce the themes to help the audience fully benefit from the fine material presented. However, “Subject theme emphasized” (P-4) will not be made a point of counsel unless next in line on the counsel slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Another presentation could be: “Hello, my name is------. I am</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">glad I found you at home, because I want to share some information with you about a very Important prophecy found in the Bible at Revelation 18: 2. There we are told: [Read.] To assist you in understanding when the fall of Babylon the Great takes place and what God’s kingdom means to mankind, this Bible-study aid has been printed.” Make the offer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> A short sermon could be given using just the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font13"> book. You might say : “The purpose of my visit is to discuss a question that Bible readers for many centuries have been interested in and would like to have answered. Just who is the woman mentioned in the Bible who is given the name Babylon the Great? [Show illustration on page 577.] This Bible-study aid clearly identifies this enemy of God, and also tells why God is going to destroy her. Also, it builds one’s faith in God’s kingdom. It is yours, along with this printed sermon, on a contribution of 75 cents.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In talks three to five choose a setting that will demonstrate the particularly beneficial nature of the scriptures assigned, in line with the theme. Explain their prophetic significance, discuss their interpretation or the principles they contain, show how the material applies in our lives in some specific circumstance or use some similar means to weave in the texts and their application throughout the talk. If two or three scriptures are needed aside from those assigned, they may be used, but, in all instances, the texts assigned should serve as the basis for the talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Most of the talks require more research than formerly, but, in addition to helping individual students improve, the school also provides material of educational value to all in attendance. So, while this additional study may be more difficult at first, our ministry requires that we be “qualified to teach,” using the Scriptures expertly in answering questions and assisting</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">A new peak in Bible studies, namely, 234,175, which is an increase of 3,359 over our previous high, and a new peak in regular pioneers, the 20th in a row—these are the highlights of the March report. How good it is to see that regular growth in the number of pioneers, because it reflects an appreciation of the urgency of the work we are doing! And the increase in the number of home Bible studies indicates that our efforts to locate the “sheep'’ are meeting -with success and that we are willing to take on the responsibility of regularly teaching them the truths of God’s Word. Keep up that good work!</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER, 1964 “Filled with the holy spirit and ... speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31. VOL-VII NO. 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">^Deait <sup>c</sup>Pub^ske!tS:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The other</span><span class="font10"> day Brother Knorr told us that there were over 68,000 persons baptized last year and that worldwide there are now, on an average, more than a million publishers proclaiming the Kingdom good news every month. All of us were glad to hear this, and we are anxious to get our copies of the 1965 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> to read more about what was accomplished this past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Frequently our brothers ask us, “What do members of the Bethel family do? What kind of life do they lead?” Well, let’s start with Monday and we’ll tell you. A bell rings at 6: 30 in the morning to get us up, and by seven o’clock all the family are expected to be at the breakfast table. Arrangements are made so that twenty persons are prepared to comment on any questions asked on the text; then Brother Knorr, or the one assigned in his absence, makes his comment. A brother is called on to represent the family in prayer, and then breakfast is served. This gets the day off to a good start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By eight o’clock everyone is at his assignment of work, either in the factory or the home. Some work on machines, others take care of office work or rooms or the laundry, and the kitchen force prepares the food. The morning goes fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At five minutes before twelve the bell rings again, and it is time to go to dinner. We all sit in our regularly assigned places, and a hot meal is served. This is our big meal for the day. Back at work after dinner, we stay with our assignments until 5 : 40 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our Monday evenings are set aside for the Bethel family to study </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> together for an hour, beginning at 7:25. It is a lively discussion and the hour goes by quickly; then we have a ministry school for the family. With ten groups meeting in different parts of the home for the last four talks, we are able to have forty student talks every Monday night. New members of the family have a special class in which they cover the</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Benefit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A businessman receiving </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'‘All Scripture Js Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font10"> wrote: “I am most delighted to receive the book. This is something that I have been wanting for a long time. It seems to have brought together the kind of information not easily obtainable. The section at the end of each chapter entitled 'Why Beneficial’ will be most helpful to me and to others.” It would make all of us happy to receive a letter like that, wouldn’t it? Well, you may hear like expressions of appreciation many times as you offer this book along with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yew World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> during December. It is an exciting offer that will help others benefit from Jehovah’s Word. It will appeal to all kinds of people; so offer it to all.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In most of our territories the entire Bible during the first six months that they are here.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Our schedule for Tuesday through Friday is the same as for Monday, except for the evenings. On Tuesday, for example, practically everyone goes to a congregation book study. Many here are book study conductors, and on Tuesday it is noticeable that fewer come to supper, because they hurry to get out in the prestudy service with the other publishers. Wednesday evening is used by the majority for back-calls or a home Bible study. Then Thursday and Friday evenings afford opportunity for personal study and attending the service meeting and ministry school in our congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Saturday we work at the factory or home only a half day. The rest of the day we have for field service or perhaps traveling to a speaking assignment. From time to time we enjoy taking the Gilead students on tours to places of interest in New York, and there are things of a personal nature that need attention too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As is true with most of you, Sunday is a day for field service for people realize that danger to Christian faith is lurking worldwide. Godlessness and communism are increasing, making many of them aware of the need to have a strong defense for one’s faith. Tying these ideas to our sermon for December and reading brief quotations from paragraphs 5-7 on pages 7 and 8 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘All Scripture”</span><span class="font10"> book should aid us to place the combination in many territories.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Of course, adaptability in our presentation is often necessary. For example, what would you do if you met a scholarly person? What could be more interesting to him than references to material in Studies 1 to 10 at the back of the book? By personal preparation, having a few key points on each theme, we shall </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3) </span><span class="font10">us, and many are on their way by 8: 30 or 9 in the morning, depending on how far they have to travel. There are meetings to attend too, and it is a full day.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">So when you stop to analyze the life of a member of the Bethel family, it is a busy one, but we learn to take our work in stride. We try to get seven or eight hours of sleep each night so that we can do good work during the day. Two weeks of vacation each year also provides a break for us when we can visit friends and relatives, and sometimes our relatives visit us here for a day or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bethel is our home, and we like it here. Our great joy is to be serving you out there in the field, and we enjoy sharing with you in. a full program of theocratic activity each week. We hope this has answered your questions, and we want you to know that you are welcome to stop in to take a tour of Bethel anytime you are in New York. May Jehovah bless all of you richly. We love all of you very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER </span><span class="font8">Theme: Being Filled with the Spirit, Help Others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Song 37. Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">“What Brings You the Greatest Happiness?” Questions and answers. Audience should look up Acts 20:35 and comment. All paragraphs should be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Help Others to Benefit.” Briefly mention the kinds of people we meet in our ministry, as outlined in the article, and why the “All Scripture” book will appeal to them. Then consider, with audience participation, the kind of people that are predominant in your territory and how the “All Scripture” book can be made appealing to them. Call on prepared publisher to demonstrate presentation appropriate in local territory. (Incorporate suggestions in paragraph 4.) If there is time, presentation in paragraph five can also be demonstrated. Encourage wide distribution of “New World Translation” and “All Scripture” book, with two booklets, for $2. When the combination is not accepted, offer the Bible and one booklet for $1. If the householder has our Bible, offer the “All Scripture” book and a booklet for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: “Will You Do Your Part?” Display figures (or announce them) showing potential for reaching 10-percent increase. Show number of Publisher’s Record cards, number of Bible studies in file, number who became inactive in past few years and how many attended your Memorial. Ten-percent increase is within reach! Interview various publishers (parent, elderly publisher, publisher conducting a study, congregation book study conductor, overseer, also pioneer and circuit servant if these are with your congregation) and call upon audience to offer suggestions from “Kingdom Ministry” or suggestions of their own as to how each one can do his part in December. Publisher being interviewed can be invited to give additional suggestions and can assure he will turn in his report by December 13. Show with confidence that the 10-percent increase can be reached!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Closing comments. Include accounts servant’s report and “How Did We Do in October?” Song 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Filled with the Spirit, Work Whole-souled for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Song 27. Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">28 min: “Employment and Your Conscience.” Use panel of secularly employed brothers and sisters who have studied material well. Chairman should present prepared questions to panel, covering article completely, as is done at the “Watchtower” study. During the study Acts 15:20, 28, 29 appearing in paragraph four, Deuteronomy 14:21 appearing in paragraph six, and 1 Peter 3:16 in the final paragraph should be read and applied. If a good consideration of the material will allow for all paragraphs to be read, this should be done. However, if time will not permit this, then paragraphs five, six, ten and eleven should be read. All publishers should be encouraged to bring their copies of the November 15, 1964, issue of “The Watchtower” to this meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Magazine-territory servant reports on meeting with overseer and includes the following three points: (1) How magazine activity can help congregation to reach the goal of 10-percent increase; also invitation for publishers to work with him in magazine activity. (2) Give two sample presentations: One featuring “The Watchtower” and one featuring “Awake!” Presentations should be adapted for use during Christmas holidays and should be brief. (3) Announce the arrangements that have been made for witnessing on Christmas day and encourage full support of these by all publishers in the congregation. Magazines or regular offer may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Presenting the Good News. During December we will be helping new ones as well as our brothers to have a full share in the public ministry. By keeping our presentations brief and pointed ‘all can share.’ Chairman invites two mature sisters to platform and asks them to relate their former conversation for the benefit of congregation. Sisters tell of their determination to keep presentations brief and pointed because people are busy during the holidays. Also they are helping others into service and brief presentations are just what these new and less experienced publishers need. One sister is called on to demonstrate simplified sermon, featuring “All Scripture” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chairman then invites new publisher or younger one to platform to demonstrate simplified sermon, featuring the Bible. Encourage all to have a full share during remaining days of December. Invite new ones to share. Be alert to offer “New World Translation” in Spanish, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese as well as English. Foreign-language editions are 50c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Concluding comments. Discuss how to reply to individuals who wish publishers “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.” A brief acknowledgment of kindly greeting is sufficient. For further suggestions see page four of December 1959 “Kingdom Ministry.” Song 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Keep Filled with the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Song 49. Introduction, text, comments. Theocratic News and Announcements that are appropriate to the congregation should be considered. Work for tasteful variety in this presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Are You Enduring or Have You Grown Weary?” Talk based on article in October 1, 1964, issue of “The Watchtower.” Give particular attention to the fact that ‘Jehovah provides help’ and that ‘we need to do our part.’ The talk should be helpful and encouraging. Give it local application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Letter from The Brooklyn Branch Office. Two brothers who are interested in Bethel service enthusiastically discuss letter and consider improving use of their time in preparation for Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font8">Assistant congregation servant gives the report thus far for December and outlines work still to be done to reach 10-percent increase. Entertain local experiences had helping others into the ministry or presenting the offer, or results of Christmas-day witnessing, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Consider Question Box, and encourage all to listen and learn at meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Encourage all publishers, especially family groups, to have full share in service during Christmas-New Year’s season. Announce arrangements for midweek w’ork (each day, if advisable) to accommodate all. Arrange something special. Song 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(Congregations having their service meeting on December 29, 30 or 31 should use this service meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Fortify Yourselves for the Activity Ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Song 86. Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Talk on theme for the month: “Fortify Yourselves for the Activity Ahead.” See January 1, 1965, “Watchtower.” (If desirable, you may use a brother who is a good teacher to explain to his son the points made in this article and how they apply to both of them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Our new sermon for the “Watchtower” campaign. The sermon should be shown on blackboard, if possible. After a brief introduction and encouragement for all to prepare, practice and use the sermon well, chairman calls on well-prepared publisher to give new sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: The Resurrection</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">John 11:25—The resurrection promise Isa. 65:21, 23, 25—What God has in store</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 6:10 (Paraphrase)—This is what we have prayed for</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After an appropriate local introduction we might say: “Almost all of us have lost loved ones in death and we wonder if we will ever see them again. This is one of the important questions that the Bible answers. Note what Jesus said as recorded at John 11:25. [Read verse and comment on the hope it holds out. It is not necessary to discuss who will be resurrected. Go right on to the next point.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Of course, the next question that comes to our mind is, When the dead return, what does God have in store for them? It is encouraging to know that conditions will not be as they are today. The prophet Isaiah assures us at Isaiah 65 that present world conditions will not plague us then, but a happy life will be enjoyed. [Read and comment on appropriate points in verses 21, 23 and 25.] This is just what we have been praying for in the Lord’s Prayer when we pray for God’s kingdom to come and God’s will to be done on earth and in heaven. It is indeed encouraging to know that such a happy life lies ahead of us and those we love, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“You will want to learn more about these subjects. ‘The Watchtower’ will aid you to ^et this needed information. A subscription for it and its companion ‘Awake!’ for one year is only $2.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you prefer to offer just the “Watchtower” subscription you may do that, but both subscriptions are often obtained as easily as one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Discuss the sermon with the audience. Entertain comments on why the introduction is appropriate, how each scripture can be applied personally to the householder and what articles in “The Watchtower” can be featured to encourage interested ones to accept subscriptions for “The Watchtower” and “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Do Not Become Fearful of Those Who Kill the Body.” Encouraging, stimulating talk by a mature brother on year’s text. See December 15, 1964, “Watchtower.” Encourage all to read reports in new “Yearbook.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font8">min: Concluding comments. Song 8.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Will You Do</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> At the end of December, when we hear the congregation’s service report discussed, how good it will be to know that we individually had a part, that those figures Include our own ministry! And how happy it will make us all if our chart shows an increase in the number of publishers of the Kingdom I That is something reasonable to expect when we are diligent in the ministry, and it is our hope that during December we will reach a 10-percent increase over our average number of publishers for the past service year. That will mean 321,550 praisers of Jehovah right here in the United States. What can we individually do to make that possible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The first thing is to be out in the service ourselves, and it will help the servants if we turn in our reports right away. So why not make it a point to have your first report for the month turned in at least by December 13? Additionally, Galatians 6:10 encourages us to ‘do good to those related to us in the faith.’ How can we do this? Well, a good place to start is at home, arranging for other members of our family to be in the service with us. Certainly we do not want to forget our own mates and our children. Then we can get in touch with some of the less mature and new publishers and invite them to work with us.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The overseer should meet with the magazine-territory servant and work with him in service early in December. See page two for points to discuss; also October </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> page three.

Order extra magazines for the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ At all service centers, study conductors will use the following program: December 13, consider the simplified sermon and keeping; the presentation brief. December 20, introductions appropriate to the territory. December 27, how to assist publishers who have not been out in the field service in December. Our goal should be to encourage and help them. We should not find fault or scold. Call on them and take them along in service that morning, if possible. January 3, the new sermon on “The Resurrection.” Prepared publisher should present it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The 1965 yeartext will be, “Do Not Become Fearful of Those Who Kill the Body.”—Matt. 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Society would like all members of the congregation committee to become well acquainted again with our letter of September 15, 1963, having to do with pioneer service and then meet with the pioneers. Each servant on the committee should personally review the letter before that meeting. Sometime before January 10 the regular and</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Your Part?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Shut-ins and other publishers who may be ill can witness to those who call at their homes and by letter writing. Really, all of us can have a share, and we want to, because we have a wonderful message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> It always stimulates us to greater activity when the overseer visits our service center. So we are suggesting that your overseer plan to work with a different service center </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each 'Week</span><span class="font10"> this month, if he can arrange to do so. This will also give him the opportunity to make personal visits, along with the study conductor, on many who need encouragement and to help them to have a part in the service during his visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Of course, not everyone is able to be out in the service on weekends. Many who need assistance can be out only on weekdays. Are you in position to work along with some of these publishers during the week? How grateful they would be for your invitation! Do not hesitate to take the initiative. Also, if you will let your study conductor know that you are in position to take someone with you in the service during the week, he will gladly help to make arrangements.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> We ought to be alert to note the circumstances of the people too. When there are children in the home, a wonderful opportunity presents itself. The children need protection of their faith. Parents need to be equipped to help their children in this as in other affairs of life. Appeal to their natural love for the children, explaining that our textbook will help them to explain to their children how the Bible came to be, how we know it is God’s inspired Word and are sure it is true. They can gather the family together for an hour each week and in a short time, by using the publications, impart much accurate knowledge, the basis of true and lasting faith.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As you know, people of both Christendom and the Jewish faith frequently say they have theii- own Bible. Can we show them how to gain benefit from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation?</span><span class="font10"> Be ready to do just that. For example, let them open their Authorized Version Bible to Genesis 2:4. What does it mean when it speaks of “the generations of the heavens and of the earth”? Then read it from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World \ Translation.</span><span class="font10"> Also, turn to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture,”</span><span class="font10"> page 13, paragraphs 3 and 4, and show how the first part of the Bible was actually compiled from written history, recorded right from the beginning with nothing left to chance by God. It is important to our faith to know that the Bible contains accurate and reliable history.</span></p></li>

Having benefited so much from this? outstanding aid ourselves, we count it a privilege to make it available to others. And all of us can have a full share in this campaign, even new publishers. We will want to keep the presentation simple, rehearse it well, and then look to Jehovah to bless our sincere efforts.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We might say: “Good morning. My name is -----. My purpose in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">calling is to encourage people of all religions to do more Bible reading. Almost everyone would like to spend more time reading the Bible, but some say they don’t because it is difficult to understand. However, this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> is much easier to understand because it is in modern English, such as we all use today.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Brings You the Greatest Happiness?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many things bring us happiness, don’t they? Yet, is it not true of dedicated servants of Jehovah and those approaching dedication that their greatest happiness comes from participating in true worship and knowing that it is acceptable to Jehovah? Reflect on this for a moment, brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When we share in house-to-house work and someone takes only a magazine, isn’t it true that our hearts well up with excitement and happiness? A.nd what </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> pleasure it is to be able to deliver the sermon even if literature is not accepted! It is just as Jesus stated: There is great happiness in giving—sharing the truth with others.—Acts 20 : 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many of us have enjoyed the pleasure of conducting progressive Bible studies, seeing interested ones recognize the truth and begin to make their minds over; and we</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">•$2, and these two printed sermons are included.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Or, we might say : “The purpose of my visit is to encourage reading of the Bible, with the goal of really understanding it. Note what Jesus said at John 17: 3 on this point. [Read and comment.] This Bible aid </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial’</span><span class="font10"> will help you in this. It considers each of the sixty-six books of the Bible. It gives a little background information, telling who the writers were and how we know each book is inspired of God. It also summarizes the contents of each book in the Bible and shows why it is beneficial to you and me. You will find it intensely interesting and most instructive. It can be yours with this copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> for only $2. These two Bible sermons in booklet form are also yours.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Many’ of the less experienced ones are children, and we want to help them share in this important campaign. So it is good for families to sit down together to prepare and rehearse the sermon, either the full one or the simplified one. Every one of us can and should share fully in presenting the good news by making this fine offer available to all interested persons.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">know what great joy it brings. Have you ever experienced the privilege of having an interested person come with you to meetings or accept your invitation to share in the field service? Then you know how your heart fills to the brim with thanks to Jehovah for the privilege of helping this interested person. And why, brothers? It is because our greatest happiness comes from being busy in Jehovah’s worship, seeing his name honored and helping others get started in true worship.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> To keep our appreciation for the privilege of serving Jehovah keen and to build it up we know we need to keep well fed spiritually. This we can do and will do by personal study and regular happy association with our brothers at the meetings. It is true as the psalmist said: “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah ■”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">♦ The Ottumwa, Iowa, congregation reports that the overseer put into effect the Society’s suggestions regarding the assistance arrangement following his return from Kingdom Ministry School. As a result, 41 publishers are now reaching the ten-hour goal instead of 14, as was the case five months ago; and 30 are now meeting the magazine goal instead of 9. ♦ ihe 108 publishers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Central Unit, planned well for increased activity in December. Forty of these publishers will be vacation pioneering during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Reports of field ministry are now being received from several more places, including Macao, Saba, Niger and Rio Muni. ♦ japan reports new peak of 248 special pioneers in September as 23 new ones start in their assignments. 2,909 congregation publishers reporting—also a new peak.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ a</span><span class="font8"> telegram from New York Circuit #8 says: “Because of the desire to free more captives from Babylon the Great, from the 1,053 publishers In circuit, 145 filled out </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">vacation pioneer applications and 9 </span><span class="font8">regular applications during assembly.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦What is the correct way to count meeting’ attendance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All adults should be counted. And how old should children be in order to be counted? The Society has not set an age. Rather, if the attendant, believes that a child is benefiting- and learning from the meeting, even to a limited extent, he should be counted. So, while children may not pay the very best attention all through the meeting, if they nonetheless benefit and learn something, they should be counted. Parents are truly wise when they teach their children to pay attention rather than provide coloring books or other things that binder children from listening and learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tt is suggested that the count be taken during the last half of the meeting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Display Conduct Worthy of the Good Hews</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our fine Christian conduct is a recommendation for the good news. Do we not represent the established kingdom of God? As representatives of God’s glorious kingdom, may we all conduct ourselves worthily of the good news, so recommending it to others. “Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ.” (Phil. 1:27; 2 Cor. 6:3-7) As we reflect credit upon the good news by our actions and our speech, we do well to examine the progress we have made in advancing the good news thus far during the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Subscription and Bible Study Goals</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> With the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign entering its third month, publishers should have obtained at least one subscription, pioneers ten and special pioneers fifteen. If any of us have not reached our goal yet, we would do well to reconsider the many helps we have for obtaining subscriptions. They are: Being out regularly in the house-to-house ministry ; having a schedule that will enable us to spend ten or more hours a month in the ministry; being well acquainted with the sermon “Will Sincerity Alone Please God?” ; remembering that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">is available in sixty-six languages, when we meet a householder who does not read English; making effective use of the information on page two, “The Purpose of ‘The Watchtower’ ”; being diligent to follow up subscription promises and ex-pired-subscription slips. Many publishers have found that offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscriptions together has met with success. One brother recently said: “Out of the first several houses Sunday morning four subscriptions were obtained as the result of offering both subscriptions. People are often inclined to take both as readily as one.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Reaching our subscription goal, of course, is only part of our objective in helping others to learn the good news. Jehovah has commanded us, not only to find, but also to feed sheeplike. ones. Since the best way to feed these persons is through a home Bible study, we will want to put forth earnest effort to start a study with those persons who subscribe and others who show interest. Our goal is one study with the public for each publisher. Are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font10"> conducting a study? If some publishers are starting more studies than they can conduct, they can notify the Bible study servant so he can transfer a study to a publisher who is not presently conducting one. Also, congregations having circuit or district servants visit them are reminded that these servants and their wives have as a goal the starting of two Bible studies each week; they will be pleased to start and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR MARCH Conducting Ourselves Worthily of the Good News.—Phil. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">turn studies over to publishers who do not as yet have a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them to Meetings </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and Memorial</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Since March is Memorial month, it is most fitting that we concentrate this month on aiding all interested persons to get to the meetings. How can we really expect a new one to be zealous in the ministry if he does not attend meetings? Only by going to the meetings can new ones be spiritually alive and so want to conduct themselves worthily of the good news. Servants and others will call on all inactive and irregular publishers and those who need encouragement. Help them from the outset of the month, inviting them to attend congregation meetings. Put forth special effort to invite them to Memorial on Saturday, March 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Then help them to keep on coming to meetings by encouraging them not to miss the stimulating special talk on April 5, “What Will ‘God’s Kingdom Come’ Mean to You?” Especially do we want interested ones to attend the service meetings during the month so they will know what they can do to share the good news with others during March and April. All of us who regularly attend meetings will want to help others attend also so they will be anxious to share in the ministry and be spiritually alive in April.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> So it would be well for all publishers to think of interested persons to invite during March, encouraging them to attend Memorial and the special talk, as well as the other meetings. To help us, the accounts servant will list on pieces of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record form since January 1963, giving the names to the publishers who obtained the subscriptions. In addition to subscribers, there are undoubtedly many others we would like to invite to the regular meetings and Memorial and the special talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In harmony with our special goal of helping all to attend meetings, there is something we should give serious thought to: Can we help others with transportation? Let us think now of those interested persons or brothers who do not have autos or easy access to public transportation systems. Are some unable to get to meetings simply because they live on the outskirts of the city? Are there elderly persons who find it difficult to use public transportation? Be alert to give help. It will take some of our time, yes, but is not this display of love in providing transportation conduct worthy of the good news? Indeed it is!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> So there are many ways this month to display conduct worthy of the good news. Let us work toward our subscription and Bible study </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of pioneer insert from December “Kingdom Ministry,” “As a Family Are You Answering the Call to Pioneer?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) To achieve the 20-percent increase in April will require planning and action now to prepare those with whom we study to share in the service. Put the suggestions. into practice at your next study. (Note: Use same qualified, mature teacher as publisher in demonstration for all three weeks.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) Publisher, after Bible study, compliments student on fine progress he has made. Student expresses appreciation. Publisher states he is happy to be of help, for in this he is following the example of Jesus, who is our model. Duke 8:1 says of him . . . (read). He taught his disciples to do the same work. (Acts 5:42) Their motive was love for God and for their fellowman. They recognized life was involved in preaching the good news and so do Jehovah’s witnesses today. (John 21: 15-17) In this way the prophecy of Jesus is carried out. (Matt. 24:14) Every proper method is employed to get the good news preached. One of these is by public Bible talks. Invites student to attend one at Kingdom Hall on Sunday. Gives him some handbills he may pass along to his friends and neighbors.</span></p>

After 6 p.m., March 28, Jehovah’s witnesses in 194 lands all around the world will be celebrating the Dord’s Evening Meal in harmony with Jesus’ command, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” This is the high point of the year for Jehovah’s people and we want to have those who have shown interest in the good news there with us. Each publisher is encouraged to make a personal list of all those he will be inviting. Include all persons of goodwill, those with whom studies are being conducted and those who have studied in the past, friends, relatives, etc. Let us carefully search out and invite all who have shown interest to attend the Memorial and special public talk with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (5 min.) Publisher invites interested person. ‘We want to draw your attention to a very important commandment in the Bible. Notice what is stated at Hebrews 10:24, 25. (Read, drawing particular attention to verse 25.) It is good that we know Jehovah is directing us to assemble together regularly, especially in this time before he executes judgment. One meeting all Christians especially want to attend is the Memorial celebration of Jesus’ death. As Jesus stated, at Luke 22:19, we should “keep doing this in remembrance of him,” and we would like to have you assemble with us. The anniversary date this year is Saturday evening, March 28. (Extend invitation.) The public meeting on Sunday, April 5, will be “What Will ‘God’s Kingdom Come’ Mean to You?” It would be a real pleasure to have you meet with us on both of these occasions.’ Arrange to meet interested person and go together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Encourage all to be enthusiastic in inviting others. Make personal arrangements to bring those you invite. Conductors to discuss and demonstrate suggested invitation in Scene I at meeting for field service Sunday morning, March 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include New World News highlights, appropriate Announcements, and brief remark on slogan at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Progressively Aiding New Ones (Part 1).’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">14 min: “Shoulder Your Responsibility —As a Young Publisher”—talk and demonstration of points.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Last week student shown that each individual must be a preacher and was invited to share by distributing handbills to friends and neighbors. This week he will be shown worldwide scope of work and invited to share for first time in door-to-door ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) After study, publisher recalls conversation of week before (using Matt. 24:14). Each year many thousands begin preaching as commanded by Jesus. Publisher brings out “Yearbook” and shows reports from various countries, on pages 32-39, remarking on worldwide expansion. House-to-house preaching is foundation of our public ministry. (Acts 20:20) Invites student to go with him in service. Student hesitant, feels he would not know what to say. Publisher understands; many new publishers have same feeling. Short sermon will be used, which student can easily learn. In fact, a few minutes can now be spent writing short presentation out on paper, and he can go over it during week. Student eager to try it. Leaves handbills for Sunday talk for student to distribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Lovingly build up Bible students to see importance of work being done world wide and how they may individually share. Use suggestions at your Bible studies during week, thus working toward 20-percent increase.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) After study, publisher refers to previous week’s discussion regarding expansion. A pleasure to do the work Jesus and disciples did. (Acts 20:20) To find sheeplike persons requires making public declaration. (Rom. 10:10) How has student done in learning short sermon? Not as well as expected. Can’t seem to make it coherent and smooth flowing. This is to be expected, at first. Together they go over sermon. Student actually gives good presentation and is commended, though some suggestions offered. Publisher invites him to come along Sunday morning to try out sermon. Student willing, if can work closely with publisher. Student assured this will be done. Also, will rehearse sermon again before going out so student will be even more confident. Time when publisher will stop by Sunday is arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Building up new ones in systematic manner will enable them to share in service in April. If you have followed suggestions given over past three weeks, you may have the great privilege of starting a new publisher in the service in April. Twenty-percent goal can be reached. Will have many new praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Progressively Aiding New Ones (Part 1)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Will you have the blessed privilege of starting a new Kingdom publisher* in the service in April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A powerful stimulant to starting new ones in the service is right association. Right association is encouraging and mutually strengthening, Why not put forth an extraordinary effort during March to accompany the newer ones to the congregation book study, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study or other congregational meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> One of the first things to determine in inviting a new one is this: Is he willing to share the good news? Does he have the desire to do so? In short, no one should serve under compulsion, for each one should know -what he is doing, why he is doing it and want to share in it to Jehovah’s honor. Moreover, the new one should be morally clean and in a fit position to represent the Most High God. (Please see “pt,” par. 51.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When should young ministers turn in a field service report? First, when they understand what they are doing, and second, when they</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servants should check to make certain that an order has been submitted for Memorial invitations, handbills for the April 5 talk and sufficient copies of the special April 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and April 22 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">Congregations having the circuit servant will order accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Accounts servants will list on sheets of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record sheet since January 1963. Each sheet should show the name of the publisher obtaining the subscription. These should be given to publishers by March 15. Publishers will want to be certain that all subscribers are invited to attend the Memorial and the special talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations having circuit assemblies on April 5 will hear the regular circuit assembly public talk. These congregations may schedule the special talk on April 12. The special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will be released at the circuit assembly following the district servant’s talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregation servants will see that the Memorial Report Card is properly-filled out and promptly put in the mail after the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is suggested that congregation servants schedule a meeting for all study conductors March 29, before or after the public meeting on Sunday or as near as possible to that date. Prior to the meeting the congregation servant should go over Publisher’s Record Cards and make a list of irregular and low-hour publishers who need assistance and see that definite assistance is given each publisher needing help. It would be well if all servants could attend this meeting so they can cooperate and support activities. The Bible study servant should be there and make known to study conductors publishers who have been conducting</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">show a desire to do that work because they know it is Jehovah’s will and are able to make then<sup>-</sup> own presentation in some feature of the service, even if just with the magazines. The Society feels that once a young minister begins to report, his parents or the one aiding him should be willing to assume the responsibility to progressively aid him so that he will be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font10"> in the service and make further* progress toward maturity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> When aiding new ones it is a good idea to reflect on our own initial efforts in the ministry. How did you feel when you started out in the preaching work? Did you appreciate the loving aid offered you by the one who trained you? Were you pleased that he did not keep you out too long when you first went in the field service? Were you grateful for the help offered in preparing the sermon, even the simplified sermon or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> magazine presentation? Were you not made happy when commended even for small things? Just as you appreciated all these things, the one you are progressively aiding will likewise appreciate them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">studies a long period of time and how such publishers might be encouraged and assisted to start new ones. Midweek service will be planned for all vacation and regular pioneers and publishers who can support it during April. ^•Accounts servants are reminded to make certain the zip code number is on all subscription blanks sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sunday morning at service centers the following program will be followed: March 8, sermon introductions; March 15, following through on subscription promises; March 22, use of Memorial invitations; March 29, stimulating experiences in obtaining subscriptions; April 5, how to start studies when literature is placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servant will meet early in March with school servant to discuss how more can be aided to have a share in the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All congregations will want to arrange special morning and afternoon magazine service on Memorial day, Saturday, March 28. Special encouragement should be given also to share in Sunday’s activities on March 29, following Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">+ Overseers and other servants should take the initiative in encouraging those who have vacation pioneered and others who can do so to vacation pioneer in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Committees of congregations that have formed corporations for the purpose of holding title to Kingdom Hall property are here reminded to see that the annual meetings as required by law are held and that the statutes of the state in which their corporation is formed and the bylaws of the corporation respecting meetings and election of officers are complied with so that each corporation will continue in good standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoulder Your Responsibility —As a Young Publisher</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Are you one of the more than 65,000 publishers in the United States under fifteen years of age? How happy we older ones are to be associated with you in the New World society I How marvelous it is to see your devotion, your zeal, your good example!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One of the big problems that confronts youthful ministers is: How can I be regular in the service, meet the goals set by the Society and still keep up with my schoolwork? The answer lies in having a schedule for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">weekly</span><span class="font10"> service. Many of our younger publishers have been aided by their parents in this respect. And what splendid examples in zeal and faith there are to copy! Think of Samuel, Jeremiah and Jesus, to mention just a few. (1 Sam. 2:18, 19, 26; Jer. 1: 4-10; Luke 2: 40-50) What made these youths outstanding? The fact that they listened to the counsel of Jehovah and paid more than the usual attention to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A good way to be introduced to the ministry is in the magazine work. Many youthful publishers are placing three or more magazines each week and are reaching the goal of twelve magazines per month. Some set aside an hour or so each week to engage in the magazine work after* school hours, under the direction of a mature brother. Have you tried this yet? Perhaps overseers can make such arrangements in the congregations, if advisable. After training is received in magazine work, help can be obtained in giving the simplified sermons. From this point it is only a small step ahead to give the full sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> And what about conducting.home Bible studies? An ever-increasing number of our youthful publishers are finding it possible, with good parental training, to conduct studies with their schoolmates in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book, and some have been aided to get the truth in this manner. You younger publishers, are you responding to all the fine training offered by your parents? Also, do you have vacation pioneering as your goal from time to time as well as advancing on to the regular pioneer work, missionary work or Bethel service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> How true the statement is, “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” (Prov. 22:6) In this connection, the Society encourages all you young ministers to fortify yourselves for the future by accepting God-given responsibilities now, and may Jehovah bless you richly for this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The time we have all eagerly been looking forward to has arrived. After March 1, or as soon as the question booklets are received, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font10"> book will be considered at the congregation book study. All publishers and interested persons should be encouraged to attend the book study regularly to receive the benefits of the fine spiritual food in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font10"> book. Progressive encouragement to attend should be given to inactive and irregular publishers as well as other interested persons. Personal calls should be made on these persons, and the study conductor should endeavor to make these calls himself. One opportune time to make such calls is on Tuesday evening prior to the study. An invitation can be extended and arrangements made that evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A friendly approach and an upbuilding Scriptural discussion on the initial call will provide a good foundation. Give the person an opportunity to discuss any problems standing in the way of attending the study and offer encouragement as well as practical suggestions to overcome such. Do not fail to show that regular meeting attendance is commanded by God (Heb. 10:25) and that it is for this reason you want to assist. The benefits of attendance can be demonstrated by considering portions of the book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Share in</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When we stop to think of it, the worldwide preaching of the established kingdom is marvelous. It is being accomplished in all parts of the earth, just as Jesus foretold. It Is the work that Jehovah God has commissioned his servants to do. Now, that presents us with a challenge: Will we individually prove ourselves to be his witnesses? Will we share in the urgent work now being done? Lives are involved. Let us respond to the challenge by sharing in the ministry to the fullest extent in April, when we have so many special provisions to help us preach the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Outstanding is the special talk, “What Will ‘God’s Kingdom Come’ Mean to You?” This is just what interested persons need, for it is designed to help them to see that they must accept the responsibility of the good news if they want to share in the Kingdom’s blessings. After the talk, be sure that new ones get a copy of the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">so they can take it home and ponder on the points it sets out. It may be</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A few points that could be considered in order to whet their appetites for regular attendance are as follows: Isaiah 14: 3-20 applies to Satan only as the earthly king of Babylon symbolizes him. (P. 314) Modern Babylon the Great had a fall in the spring of 1919. (Pp. 500, 505) The number 666 emphasizes the imperfection and deficiency of Satan’s earthly political organization. (Pp. 506-509) It is too late to turn to God after Babylon’s destruction. (P. 558) The “one hour” of Revelation 17:12 began in 1920. (P. 595)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If some do not respond to your invitation on the first call, continue to show a sincere interest in their spiritual welfare. All publishers should endeavor to be regular in attendance. Family heads should arrange for their children to attend and participate. Take full advantage of these marvelous provisions made through Jehovah’s organization and I assist others to do the same.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">April Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the turning point in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> To help make the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> a turning point in their lives there are other articles addressed to people who have manifested interest. One article asks them, “What Holds You Back from True Worship?” It helps them to see what it is that has made them hold back from serving Jehovah and how to correct the situation. Another article emphasizes the importance of the ministry, and it will help those who feel they cannot preach to get started. So use the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for everyone on your back-call list who needs to be stimulated! A fitting complement to the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> on “Examining the Foundations of Modern-Day Religion.” This is ideal for those who have hesitated to abandon Babylon the Great. It helps them to see exactly what the religious systems are built on and puts the issue squarely before them: Is that what you want? Let’s all use these magazines enthusiastically during April. Make it a month of special activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The second-highest number reporting for this service year! That is our fine January report. It was indeed good to see 290,488 share in the preaching work. While that is fewer than the previous month, our drop in publishers from December to January, was only 6,519, whereas last year it was 13,585. All publishers and pioneers are to be commended for continuing to help ones who shared in December service and all will want to continue the fine work. Speaking of pioneers, we are pleased to let you know that another new peak was reached in January, the eighteenth month in a row!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As for subscriptions, it was the best January on record, with 128,783 reported, to compare with 116,247 last January. In addition to getting subscriptions, many new Bible studies are being started. We increased from 218,449 in December to 224,948 in January. Very fine, indeed! Keep up the excellent ministry, brothers, as we •unitedly continue to find, feed and tenderly care for the &quot;other sheep.”</span></p>

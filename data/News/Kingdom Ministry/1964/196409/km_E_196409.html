<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">SEPTEMBER, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">1964</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"> “Filled with the holy spirit end ... speaking the word of God with boldness?'—Acts 4:31. &nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. VII NO. 9</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark1"></a>&lt;T)ea/i ^PubMe/tS;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">It is hard to believe, but another service year has ended, and all of us together had a wonderful year. We are certainly thankful for that series of “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies. It made us all do a lot of thinking, and now we are anxious to get much of that information in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As you know, during the year we had a new peak of 315,568 publishers, which means that many more have joined with us on the road to life. It is also good to see that we are conducting 205,938 home Bible studies, and it is really a privilege to help these other sheeplike people, isn’t it? It takes a lot of time, but it makes us happy to be able to spend time with these people who are seeking God’s goodwill, in order to aid them to get a proper appreciation of the wonderful provision for life that he has made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here in Brooklyn we have heard that the Society is making plans for large conventions in the smaller countries of Europe during the summer of 1965. We understand that at some of the assemblies this summer Brother Knorr and Brother Franz mentioned that they are planning to go and said that many others from the United States will also probably take advantage of a three-week excursion arrangement being made by the Society so they can be with their brothers at the conventions in the Scandinavian or German-speaking countries next summer. There is talk here at Bethel that as many as 2,000 may be going. Later on, we will probably have more information for you about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With summer coming to a close, likely all of us will get back into our regular routine of service now. Of course, the children will be going back to school, but we don’t want to forget to help them to maintain a regulai' program of service and meeting attendance right along with us. And, with vacations over, we’ll be able to get our Bible studies on a more regular basis again too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have had two fine months of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Schedule Dedicated Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What does this subject bring to your mind? You are probably thinking: ‘I have dedicated my life—all that I am and own—to Jehovah and his service. So I should use all my time in a way that will please Jehovah. But there are so many things to be done that the only way to do justice to them all is to have a schedule.’ Are these your heartfelt thoughts? If they are, you are in line for many blessings. You will get satisfaction from what you do, because you will be doing the really important things and you will be making progress in them because of your regularity.—Phil. 1: 9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Of course, there are many things that require our attention, such as earning a livelihood, caring for one’s family, going to school, and attending congregation meetings, and these field activity with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font11"> book now, and we will all enjoy continuing to offer the book during September. What a fine publication it is! It is true that the book is deep, but it is arousing interest, and Bible studies are being started in it. So far, we have had to print 2,250,000 copies in the factory here at Brooklyn to supply your needs.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">To keep up with the work, we have obtained some new printing presses, and this has caused quite a bit of excitement here at Bethel. Two brand-new presses, 80,355 pounds each, just came in from Germany. They are MAN presses, rotaries. We will use them to print </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> and Bibles, books and booklets as necessary. As soon as they are erected, we will have eighteen large rotary presses in operation on the sixth floor of the factory here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We’re glad that all of you out there in the field are keeping us so busy here in Brooklyn. May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with you as together we show others how beneficial the Scriptures are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">things have a definite place in the life of a Christian. But there is something else that should have a prominent place in our schedule, and that is our field ministry. Reading a few scriptures can help us to appreciate the reason for that. Isaiah 60:22 foretells the gathering work now being done. Matthew 9:37, 38 shows that it would be done, not miraculously, but by dedicated servants of God. Matthew 24:14 emphasizes that the time for such preaching has a definite limitation. Ephesians 5:15, 16 highlights the need to make the best possible use of our time now. So time for the ministry should be scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Make Up a Schedule</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To schedule time for the ministry, what should you do? Sit down with paper and pencil. Do so prayerfully. Arrange a weekly schedule, deciding on the days and hours you-can devote to the field ministry. Don’t set your sights so high that you will get discouraged because you fail to meet your goal. But remember that you want to spend at least two and a half hours in the service each week, or ten hours a month. And endeavor to have some share in each feature of the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> By all means, talk it over with others. If others in your household are publishers of the good news, discuss the schedule together. Those whose immediate family are not dedicated may discuss their schedule with their study conductor or the congregation servant. You will benefit from their suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Now, with the new service year beginning, is a good time to arrange your schedule for service, or to bring the one you have up to date. Let’s all take time to do this during September.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Encouraging all of us to make the best possible use of the time available to us, the apostle Paul wrote: “We desire each one of you </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER 15 mln: </span><span class="font9">Song 6. Introduction, text and comments. As discussion of text concludes, another brother comes to front, enthusiastically asking one on platform, “Did you read the letter we received?’’ Together they proceed to read and discuss letter in column one on front page of “Kingdom Ministry.” Emphasize offer for month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: “Do You Stress the Theme?” Questions and answers, and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font9">Magazine-territory servant discusses “Topics to Talk About.” Mention magazine goals for October (see Announcements), and encourage all to order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Be Guided by Bible Principles in School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mature brother discusses with two children, preferably his own, material in article on “Youths,” in June 15, 1964, “Watchtower.” Cover points under subheadings “Elective Offices and Positions,” “Classroom Instruction” and “Athletic Instruction,” with related Bible principles from first part of article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts servant’s report, also “How Did We Do in July?” Song 17. (NOTE: Time used for opening and concluding songs is in addition to the hour program.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Song 57. Introduction; then discussion of text by man and wife at breakfast table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min; Avoid False Religious Entanglements in School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Talk by mature brother on first part of article “Youths, Guard Your Spirituality,” in September 1, 1964, “Watchtower.” Cover material down to, but not including, subheading “After-School Athletics.” Make application of principles clear enough so young folks will have no difficulty in applying them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Schedule Dedicated Time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discussion of article on front page of “Kingdom Ministry,” with audience participation. On paragraphs 1 and 2, have everyone look up scriptures; read and comment. Along with paragraphs 3-5, discuss the various service arrangements in your congregation, taking one feature of service at a time; suggest that publishers list the ones that are most convenient for them— at least one for each feature of service, if possible. (They may also go in service at any other convenient time.) Recommend that they use this list when they work out details of personal service schedule at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Analyzing Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Overseers may arrange for a model Publisher’s Record card to be on the platform, showing the actual averages month by month of a publisher with the congregation as figured from the weekly record sheets, also a model for pioneers, or they may use the service chart. Publishers and pioneers will be given their cards for this meeting part so they can analyze their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servants should briefly review the month-by-month campaigns, considering literature averages shown on the model cards. For example. the offer for last September was ‘ Det Your Name Be Sanctified” and “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” with two booklets, for a dollar. State the monthly offer (review “Kingdom Ministry” for monthly offers), then encourage all to compare their activity with the average publisher or pioneer activity shown on the model cards. After covering placements, make an analysis of the hour column. Publishers are encouraged to spend ten or more hours in field service, pioneers 100 hours or more. Commend publishers and pioneers for what they have done. Give number of publishers averaging ten or more hours and the number below ten hours. Offer suggestions for improving hours. (See February 1964 “Kingdom Ministry” supplement.) Interview one who increased hours with personal assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consider the back-call and Bible study activity together. Publishers’ goal is six back-calls and one Bible study; pioneers’, 33 and seven. Give facts and figures as to how many are reaching goals. Here again, offer appropriate suggestions and interview one assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cover magazine activity. How many reach goals? Give figures. Also number who are below suggested twelve, with suggestions foi’ increasing placements. Interview one who has been assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Summarize value of analyzing our ministry. Outline 10- and 20-percent goals for the congregation and potential increase. Overseers will handle this entire part in an encouraging, upbuilding manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments. Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Song 11. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: What About “Other” Activities at School?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discussion based on article “Youths, Guard Your Spirituality,” in September 1, 1964, “Watchtower.” Cover material from “After-School Athletics” to end of article. Mature brother directs questions to panel of teen-age publishers; be sure to draw out reasons for answers. Brother in charge should clarify and emphasize points as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Is Your Service Meeting Lively?” Animated question-and-answer coverage of article; after which several servants discuss together application of points to local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Presenting the Good News. Discuss and demonstrate points. Invite comments from audience. Include slogan at bottom of page 4; see Colos-sians 4: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. Start with congregation servant and Bible study servant walking toward platform discussing what may be reported as a back-call. (See paragraph 49 in “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.”) Song 28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on theme for the month, “Diligent in Declaring the Everlasting Good News.” (See “Watchtower” of October 1, 1964, also October 1, 1963. Tie in remarks with circumstances and service arrangements in local congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">New Sermon for “Awake!” Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (12 min.) Develop sermon with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Events of Our Times Show God’s Kingdom Is at Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Critical times are sign of last days —2 Tim. 3: 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Current events fulfill Bible prophecy —2 Tim. 3:2-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake persons can take courage</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—Luke 21: 28, 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (5 min.) Demonstrate sermon as follows: “Good morning. My name is -----. What is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">yours? [Allow time for reply.] It’s a pleasure to meet you, and, frankly, the purpose of my visit is to share some meaningful thoughts about the fastmoving events of our times. Have you ever wondered if the Bible sheds light on what these things mean? [Allow householder to comment.] Note what 2 Timothy 3: 1 says. [Read.] Please observe also the points made in verses 2-5. [Read or point out a few key portions and mention how this accurately foretells current events.] While these things may dishearten many, we need not despair, for Jesus also foretold that persons who were awake to the meaning of our times could take courage, and he showed why. [Read Luke 21: 28, 31.] To help you stay awake you will find the ‘Awake!’ magazine an invaluable aid.” (Refer to appropriate point in magazine and present subscription.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Learn sermon well. Parents, teach it to your children. Study conductors, help those in your group to learn it. May we all have a full share in this grand work by offering the “Awake!” subscription at every opportunity in October.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many of us attended a district assembly during July and what a spiritually-rewarding experience this was! In addition to this, we did quite well in the field, averaging 9.4 hours and 10.6 magazines. Undoubtedly the splendid benefits from attending the assemblies will provide incentive to further increase our zeal and joy for Jehovah’s service in the months ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Also, for the 24th month in a row we had a new peak in pioneers! Have you prayerfully considered whether or not you can enter this marvelous field yet? Jehovah’s blessing is sure to be on those who work in this right direction.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Your Service Meeting Lively?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> All of us spend a considerable amount of time getting to the service meeting. We feel that it is an important part of our lives as preachers of the good news, and we go to the meeting to learn, don’t we? From time to time we have the opportunity to take a part in the program, perhaps giving a talk or sharing in a demonstration. So we can share in making that meeting interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If you are a congregation servant, do you see to it that the brothers have their assignments for the program well in advance? Are the demonstrations rehearsed? These things make a big difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> If we who are assigned parts on the service meeting work on them just as hard as we do on our talks for the theocratic ministry school, what outstanding meetings we will have! But it is not only the time that we spend on them; it is the originality we show that adds interest. For example, when someone on the ministry school program uses a practical setting and really good illustrations, we all enjoy it so much, don’t we? The same is true of our service meetings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> While the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font11">supplies an outline for our meetings, it cannot, in a few words, express all the details, the excitement and the spirit that need to go into that meeting. But the overseer and the others of us assisting in the program can use imagination to put across the instruction in an interesting way so that it will make a lasting impression. This does not mean that we make our meetings big dramatic productions, but the fact is that we are all different and if we put on our parts with that same variety that characterizes us as people, they will be enjoyable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> For example, there are many ways that the day’s text can be discussed we do not always have to use a talk. Nor do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> experiences always have to be handled the same way. Why not demonstrate some of them? And if you have an article from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule Dedicated Time </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, in order that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. 6:11, 12) Did you notice the reward that comes from such wise use of dedicated time? It is the full assurance of the realization of the hope set before us by God. What a marvelous blessing that is for those who use their time wisely now! consider, you may want to work in some local field experiences that illustrate the points or a short demonstration. Perhaps you will turn to your congregation chart and point out what it shows about the situation locally. Help the brothers to see that the chart represents people and loving service to God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> That liveliness can be evident right down to the end of the meeting. Even the congregation servant’s concluding comments do not have to be handled in the same way each week. Why not discuss some of the announcements with another brother, doing so in a casual manner, or work them into a little skit that is interesting and that emphasizes the important points ? If another brother has something to say about certain features of service earlier in the meeting, perhaps he can mention the times of meeting for those features of service; then you will have time for other things at the end of the meeting. When someone has a good field experience you can arrange to fit that in so all will enjoy it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> So if the congregation servant invites you to take a part on the service meeting, do not hesitate to discuss with him how you would like to present it. Make your service meetings live, make them human, make them interesting. This is a meeting to care for the service needs of your congregation. Make it outstanding.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Stress the Theme?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we share in the field ministry, every one of us wants to be effective. But does it ever happen to you that, even when you talk to people, they just do not seem to get the point? In some cases that is because they are the kind of people of whom Jesus spoke when he said : “Toward them the prophecy of Isaiah is having fulfillment, which says, ‘By hearing, you will hear but by no means get the sense of it.’ ” (Matt. 13:14) So, knowing that there will be people like that, we do not get discouraged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But often there is something we can do to make sure that people will get the point. Those who have had much experience in the ministry find that their witnessing is most effective when they make a conscious effort to emphasize the sermon theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What we mean by the theme is the particular aspect from which a subject is viewed. It is something that must permeate the entire talk, not simply a statement that is made once. It is like one’s backbone or spinal column, without which the whole body would collapse. It can be highlighted by repeating key words or the central idea in the theme. If you really emphasize the theme, it will stick in the householder’s mind long after you leave.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> For example, this month we are talking on the theme “Flee from Babylon the Great.” If we stress that theme, the householder- will not simply recall that we were there to talk about the Bible or that we said something about the tower of Babel, but he will know that we urged him to flee from Babylon the Great. It is this theme that tells us the aspect from which to view the scriptures that we read.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> So the reason that we tell him what happened at the tower of Babel is to help him see the importance of fleeing from Babylon the Great, and it is for the same reason that we point out that Babylon the Great has fallen and is foul-smelling to God. The entire discussion prepares the householder for Revelation 18: 4 and its command: “Get out of her, my people.” And when we read Revelation 21:4, we point out, not merely that these are blessings that God has in store for mankind, but that these blessings are for those who flee from Babylon the Great.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If we all work on stressing our sermon themes, we can improve our effectiveness in the ministry, and, to the extent that it depends upon us, we will be sure that householders do get the point.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Overcoming fhe Objection, “We Belong to a Church”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When a publishei’ called at a door in her territory, the householder said, ‘You ought to go to the people that really need the Bible. We belong to a church.’ That objection is often encountered in our house-to-house ministry. How have you overcome it? For us to be effective in our ministry, objections must be overcome. How could this one be handled, resulting in our being able to present the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The publisher tactfully replied : ‘We are eager to help those who are in need of Bible instruction. Do you have in mind someone that particularly needs such help here in your neighborhood?’ The householder hesitated, then said: ‘Yes, there is a family down the street. You should call on them.’ The publisher carefully inquired as to the name, made note of the address and said: ‘I will be sure to call at their home, but before I do, would you please tell me what you have already discussed with them from the Bible so I will know where to take up the discussion with them?’ Of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Topics to Talk About</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We are very much interested in what people are talking about, because the topics that interest them give us openings to present the good news. One thing that affects everybody is the collapse of moral standards ; it is constantly in the news and is a topic of conversation. So we have selected the theme “The Moral Breakdown—What Can Be Done About It?” for our October 8 special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> It is something that will be easy to place with people, and it will do them good to read it. Why? Because it tells them things that they don’t know. They know the world has problems, but very few of them know the real cause. Nor do they know what can be done about it. We know the answers to those questions, and we can share them with the people in our territory by offering them the special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> That’s what we’re going to do during October. We feel sure that you will find this issue an excellent one for the maga-course, the householder never had discussed the Bible with them. The publisher tactfully asked the householder, ‘Do you think this information would help the other person?’ Respectfully the householder listened to the regular sermon. She thought that would be fine. A witness was given as intended and a return visit will be made. The publisher presented the good news!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What common objections do you encounter in the territory you work? Have you thought out a good reply, one that will enable you to present the good news effectively ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The Society would be pleased to hear from publishers, pioneers and servants as to common objections encountered, along with the particular answer they have found to be effective in overcoming the objection. It may well be that something that works effectively for you will be helpful to our brothers elsewhere and can be published under “Presenting the Good News.” Suggestions are welcome. All are to be submitted through the congregation servant, who will initial all letters sent to the Society.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">zine work, and it will also be very appropriate for obtaining subscriptions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Something else that people talk about is the matter of world peace. They’re dreadfully afraid that the world is going to explode in a nuclear war, but we know that the alternative to peace with God is far more fearful than nuclear war. You will remember the very fine public talk that was given at the assemblies this past summer—“ ‘Peace Among Men of Good Will’ or Armageddon—Which?” That is what will be featured in our special October 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> It is a topic that will be easy to talk about.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If you haven’t already done so, be sure to let your magazineterritory servant know how many extra copies of these special issues you hope to be able to use. We should all be able to use them to good advantage in stimulating Bible discussions, because they contain topics that people do talk about.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">• What viewpoint should we take toward membership in such organizations as the YMCA, if one’s membership is solely for the use of recreational facilities ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Young Men’s Christian Association is in actuality a manifestation of interfaith. Regardless of the reasons for which various persons may personally choose to be affiliated with it, the underlying purpose of the organization itself is religious. One who fills out a membership form and pays the required fee so that he will be entitled to regular use of the organization’s recreational facilities becomes a part of that organization. And it must be borne in mind that all these religious systems that are not serving Jehovah God are part of Babylon the Great. Joining such an organization is an act of apostasy. How unwise it would be to assign bodily exercise such a prominent place in our lives that we would compromise our faith to engage in it! (1 Tim. 4: 8) So if any have done this without realizing what was involved, it would be wise to take action right away to sever those connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, it ought to be borne in mind that becoming a card-carrying member of an organization such as this is different from renting their facilities on a particular occasion for a stipulated price. On occasion, auditoriums and swimming pools have been rented from these organizations for use in connection with an assembly, but that is not the same as entering into an alliance with the organization as a member of it.</span></p>

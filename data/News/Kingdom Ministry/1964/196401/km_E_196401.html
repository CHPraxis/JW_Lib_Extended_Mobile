<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JANUARY, 1964 “Filled with the holy spirit end ... speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31. &nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. VII NO, 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God has equipped us for fighting “the fine fight of the faith.” By being filled with holy spirit and by skillful use of God’s Word, the “sword of the spirit,” we can fight the fine fight as soldiers of Jesus Christ, boldly offering “the fine public declaration” about the kingdom of God. In announcing Jehovah’s kingdom, truly no journal can equal </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font10">'\'e therefore count it a privilege to participate in the 26th annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As we begin this campaign, it would be well for each one of us to reflect on how valuable </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is in helping us and others to get a firm hold on the hope of everlasting life in God’s new order. We know (hat </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is devoted to announcing God's kingdom and that it is the instrument Jehovah is using. So we should offer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">with confidence, having a positive attitude. Why, if the householder who takes a subscription reads just one article in each issue that arrives, just think what good that will do! Many persons, of course, will read more than one article, and so we want to get </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> into their homes twenty-four times a year. Publishers will have the goal of obtaining two new subscriptions during the four-month campaign; pioneers 20, and special pioneers 30. Publishers will remit 90c for each new subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Congregations, if they desire, may prepare a chart or graph showing the progress made during the campaign. The chart will showrapid gains if we spend sufficient time in house-to-house work. One young publisher twelve years of age obtained eight subscriptions during the last campaign, mostly through use of the simplified sermon in house-to-house work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If we become well acquainted with the fine, field-tested sermon “Will Sincerity Alone Please God?” we will be helped greatly in reaching the desired goal. If would be well for families to rehearse the sermon together, as well as those in the training program and those in the assistance arrangement. Aftergiving the sermon, we will find it advantageous to refer the householder to the article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> that ties in with the sermon. Throughout the campaign we will be able to make wise use of these specially prepared articles that will be related to our sermon theme. These will be articles people ought to read and that will help them</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Public Talks More Effective</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Public talks afford excellent opportunities for teaching interested persons and our brothers. Unfortunately this opportunity is often missed by public speakers. While it is always beneficial to hear the Bible discussed for an hour, it has been observed that in too many instances those in the audience go home without having any outstanding points really impressed on their minds. Without consulting a handbill, they may even be uncertain of the theme, the title of the talk. Though they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">i OFFER FOR JANUARY ! I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p>

J j THEME FOR JANUARY ! 5 “Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith.” I j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">~J Jim- . i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">have heard many scriptures read, they would benefit more if they heard them discussed at greater length. There is no question that they benefited by attending the meeting, but they would have benefited even more if the speaker had given more attention to teaching.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For more effective public talks we need to make the main points stand out. Why? Because our objective is not just to cover material and read many scriptures. More good make a decision. We will also find it helpful to open the journal to page two and read a few paragraphs from “The Purpose of ‘The Watchtower.’ ”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> After the presentation, we are often told by householders that if we return they will take the subscription. We want to make a note of all such promises and be certain to make the return calls. It would be well to fill out a subscription slip as a reminder to ourselves and the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 2, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">can be done by impressing upon our hearers a few principal ideas and helping them to understand them clearly. No audience will remember all that is said during the hour, but if the speaker has made to stand out a small number of main arguments or points of counsel—no more than can be counted on one hand —and tied them all in to the theme, the audience will go away with those points fixed in mind. In this way we impart, not hazy thoughts, but accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How can we make main points stand out? First, if we are assigned a talk, whether a public talk or one in the theocratic ministry school or on the service meeting, we should make certain that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font10"> have the main points clearly in mind. Before getting up to speak we should readily be able to list those main points from memory. And at any time during our talk we should know what main point we are developing. If we do not know, how will the audience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> With the main points in mind, we can use our subpoints, not to compete with our main points, but to build them up. To help public speakers do this, outlines this year will have their main points specially</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk on new yeartext. (See 1964 “Yearbook,” pp. 291-293.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of the main article, “Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Presenting the Good News” —discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (Cover “What Happened Here in November?” and brief remarks on slogan, based on Acts 5:20, at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: New World News and Announcements. (Apportion sufficient time to present clearly all the announcements that should be brought to the attention of the congregation.) 12 min: Report from literature and accounts servants based on meeting with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">22 min: Back-Call Sermon with “Good News” Booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Obtaining subscriptions is not end in itself, but studies should be started with subscribers where possible. “This Good News of the Kingdom” should be one of the booklets left when subscription is taken. It has been a fine instrument for starting studies for a number of years. When making a back-call it is best to get into the booklet very quickly, and the following back-call sermon will permit this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(11 min.) Chairman develops back-call sermon with audience. (Previous week all should be encouraged to bring “Good News” booklet with them.) After suggesting that you might step in, you could say: “I’m glad to see you again. Last week we discussed the subject ‘Will Sincerity Alone Please God?’ You will recall the scripture at Matthew 7:21, where we read that Jesus pointed out that not all who say, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens. [Paraphrase scripture.] We also talked about the need of study as pointed out at John 17:3, which says: [Read.] Note the emphasis laid on the need to know the true God. How does one get to know the true God? The booklet ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ which was left with you on my last call, has a portion that explains this. [Ask householder to get booklet and turn to page 5.] Here, under the subheading ‘The True God,’ is a brief but very fine explanation of who the true God is and why we must learn of him. I’ll read the questions asked at the bottom of the page and as we look for the answers you will appreciate the other pointed scriptures that are included.” (Consider paragraphs 5 and 6.) Then turn back to paragraph 1, saying, “Now that we know something about the true God, let us see how the booklet is introduced.” (Paragraphs 1-4 can be considered and then take up paragraph 7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) Capable, well-prepared publisher demonstrates back-call sermon and continues in booklet as far as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Studies can be started on initial call in many instances. This should be done wherever possible. Otherwise, above back-call sermon can be used. It is simple and all in congregation can use it. Rehearse it with family members or other publishers. Call back on every “Good News” placement, using sermon with confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Talk on Congregation Organization article “Regularly Attend the Congregation Book Study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Follow Through on Subscription Promises</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) When we offer the “Watchtower” subscription, persons of goodwill often say: “Instead of getting the subscription, I will be glad to take that copy to get acquainted with the magazine.” Or, “I would like to have the subscription, but I don’t have the money.” Keep careful record of these people. In fact, when definite interest is shown, it is often wise to fill out the subscription slip right then. Make definite arrangements to call back and then keep your promise. Many publishers have had excellent success in obtaining subscriptions by following through on all prospects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In calling back we want to help these people learn the truth. “The Watchtower” will aid them and so will a home Bible study. Have both in mind. Remember also, it was a sermon that first caught the interest of the householder. So, on your return call, begin again with a Scriptural discussion before offering the subscription. (Get suggestions from audience on how this might be done.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (7 min.) Prepared publisher gives sample presentation. “I am happy I found you home. I enjoyed talking to you last week very much. It is always a pleasure to talk to a person who appreciates the importance of taking in Bible knowledge. You will remember that we read in the Bible at John 17:3 that our hope of everlasting life depends on taking in accurate knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ. [Read and comment on verse.] Just to illustrate one of the valuable things we can learn from the Bible, observe this statement (or article) in the new issue of ‘The Watchtower.’ ” (Make appropriate comments. Renew subscription offer, using subscription slip previously filled out. After subscription is accepted, offer to step in for a few minutes to demonstrate use of “Good News” booklet. Start study.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encourage all to keep careful record of subscription prospects. Review points made in demonstration. Study conductors to review and demonstrate presentation at meeting for field service Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of pioneer material “Parents, Are You Answering the Call to Pioneer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min; Concluding comments. (Include brief remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min; Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article “Make Public Talks More Effective.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Congregations will develop their own program, having in mind weakness from last circuit servant’s visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Applying the General Priesthood Principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min; Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower” of March i, 1963, pp. 137-152, July 1, 1963, pp. 415, 416, also February 1, 1964.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min; Question-and-answer discussion of “Shoulder Your Responsibility —As a Family Head.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Men of Goodwill See that God Is with Us. (Keep in mind your theme, and relate the following “Yearbook” experiences in such a way that you emphasize it.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is encouraging to see that, as a result of the zealous activity of Jehovah’s people, men of goodwill are attracted to the New World society. Sheeplike ones see that Jehovah’s witnesses have God’s spirit, and they want to join with them in true worship. (Zech. 8:23) Often it is our zealous activity in the ministry, observed by others, that convinces them that this work must be of God. (125 Hl; 170 112; 113 UI) Others are drawn by the fact that we know and use the Bible and gladly help others to learn what it teaches. (231 U3; 128 U2; 148 ff3, 4; 225 UI) Continue zealously applying the general priesthood principle so that yet more will be aided to see that Jehovah is with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Fight the Fine Fight &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> When a householder subscribes for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> let us print in the information neatly and obtain the zip code number if it is available, putting it on the slip where provision is made for the zone number. With each subscription give three booklets: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font10"> and the two new ones, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">When God )s King over All the Earth.</span><span class="font10"> Whenever the subscription is not taken, we may offer two magazines for 10c or these three booklets on a contribution of 15c. If any of us desire to offer both the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscriptions, yvith six booklets, we may do so, many publishers having had good success with this offer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> As we push forward in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign, we want to remember the many new ones who have started in December and others who have been irregular or inactive and assist them to share in the ministry. Aid them to prepare the simplified sermon or make a magazine presentation. Each publisher who started a new one in the ministry during December will want to follow through in January.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> May we use, then, all the helps available to us, as we fight the fine fight, aiding ourselves and others, too, to get a firm hold on everlasting life.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Regularly Attend the Congregation Book Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> One of our most stimulating-meetings of the week is the congregation book study. Usually it is here that interested persons are first introduced to meetings of the New World society. Here, too, there are more opportunities to comment, building up our faith. It is also here that many new truths are brought out from the publications. Then, too, we are given much personal encouragement to press on in the ministry, bringing about greater individual maturity. What compelling reasons we have to attend the congregation book study regularly! Yet. only 76 percent of our brothers do. How can we help the more than 75,000 publishers who do not yet attend?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Very likely our brothers not a ttending regularly need loving assistance to appreciate the importance of the congregation book study more fully. Perhaps a friendly word</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Beginning January 20 orders may be placea for the 1963 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> bound volumes in English and Spanish, the 1963 supplement to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index,</span><span class="font9"> and the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Questions on the Book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’- God's Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font9"> Publishers and pioneers should order through the congregation. The bound volumes are $2 each. Orders for the 1962 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font9"> were considerably fewer than for the 1961 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span><span class="font9"> Apparently many did not get their 1962 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font9"> and as a result we have a good supply left in stock. Those who did not obtain a copy of the 1962 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font9"> may wish to order these at the same time they order the 1963 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index. </span><span class="font9">They are all 10c per copy. The booklet of study questions on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book is also 10c per copy. Please ascertain the needs of the congregation for these items and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">order them all at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ At the beginning of March congregations may start to study the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book at the congregation book studies, if they have completed studying the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified&quot;</span><span class="font9"> at least once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ A special public talk entitled “What Will ‘God’s Kingdom Come’ Mean to You?” will be delivered in all congregations on April 5. Manuscript for the talk will be provided by the Society, but the speaker may be assigned and handbills ordered by the congregation now. The one assigned to deliver the talk should be an excellent reader, someone who reads with proper emphasis and feeling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Memorial this year will be on March 28. Printed Memorial invitations may be ordered from the Society, using the regular handbill order form. The price is 25c per 1,000; 15c for 500; 10c for 250. Please submit your order for these invitations at the same time as the order for the special public talk handbills, but on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">separate</span><span class="font9"> order forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Outlines for the 1964 series of public talks are being sent to each congregation. When they are received the congregation servant should assign quali</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">of encouragement or, better yet, a promise to drop by and pick them up or accompany them to the study will start the good habit of regular attendance. Some brothers engaging in prestudy work have found it advantageous to call at a publisher’s home and indicate they would be happy to call again in 30 or 40 minutes and go with that one to the book study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> And what a blessing the book study is to newly interested persons! Here they meet others from their neighborhood who are learning of Jehovah and his promises. The warm and friendly atmosphere is uplifting to them, the love shown them is heartwarming and their introduction to the New World society becomes a happy experience. Soon some are on their way to attending other meetings, sharing in the service and eventually dedicating their lives to serve Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If we can improve our personal attendance at the congregation book study, why not do so immediately?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">fied public speakers one or two talks, depending on the number of speakers available. The new series will begin on April 12. At this time it would be well for the service committee to review the list of brothers giving public talks to make sure they qualify for this privilege; care should be used to put only mature, qualified brothers on the list hereafter. When considering whether or not one should be a public speaker, the question could be asked: Would I like to listen to him speak for an hour, and would he hold my attention, delivering accurate truth in an interesting manner?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Starting March 1 circuit servants will give the public talk “Benefiting Eternally from God’s Own Book.” The new district servant’s talk, starting at circuit assemblies held February 28-March 1, will be “Facing Up to the Urgency of Our Times.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span class="font9"> Service centers will follow this schedule Sunday mornings after the daily text: January 12, review simplified sermon; January 19, the back-call sermon; January 26, how to follow through on subscription promises; February 2, appropriate introductions. O All publishers will want a copy of the 1964 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font9"> now available, for 50c each. Read the text every day. The beautiful new calendar is 25c. Since both the calendar and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> inspire us to preach the word of God with boldness, publishers studying with persons approaching dedication would do well to inform them how to obtain copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">^•Alterations for pages 51, 52 and 53 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity</span><span class="font9"> are being sent to the congregation servant. At a time to be announced by him, all publishers and pioneers should bring their copies of the booklet to the service meeting. He will have scissors and paste on hand and enough publishers properly instructed to paste the revised pages in the booklets quickly and neatly after the meeting. Congregation servants may request more alteration sheets if , they are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoulder Your Responsibility -—As a Family Head</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It has been said that good families make good congregations. How vital it is, then, to shoulder your responsibility as a family head. As such you have assigned to you the privilege and responsibility of leading your wife and children in true worship. How are you discharging this responsibility?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As a family head, are you taking the lead in arranging for a family home Bible study? Is this conducted at least once a week so that the entire family is spiritually built up? Does your schedule also include time for group study through attendance at all the congregation meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Essential too is family prayer. Have you taken time to explain the purpose and value of prayer to your family? Set the example at mealtimes, at meetings and in the evening-before retiring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Regular weekly field service for each member of the family is also of great importance. This calls for good family organization. First, patiently teach your children simplified sermons, how to do magazine work, and then let them gain the joy of advancing to the point of being teachers of others. Arrange a family schedule of field service to put into practice the things they have learned. Take them along with you in all features of the ministry. Your own leadership will provide them with an incentive to serve Jehovah.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Recently two line theocratic families of four each reported on the excellent improvement they made in their activity after working out a family schedule and sticking to it. Both families nearly doubled their average hours. In one family each member averaged 15.8 magazines before and 30.5 after. In the other family, back-calls increased from 2.6 to 6.8. True, they were both doing well before, but what a fine increase after making a schedule! In the first six weeks these two families started nine new studies. One of the sisters reported that, even with the increased activity, with the schedule she has more time than ever before.</span></p></li>

This responsibility is enjoined upon you when you become “one flesh” through marriage. Wisely accept and discharge this responsibility for which you are accountable to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Simplified Sermon</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■’ Continually, fine reports are received by the Society of results had by young and newer publishers in usingsimplified sermons, as well as by older publishers when witnessing to busy householders. The following-presentations can be used in offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. I am one of your neighbors. The purpose of my call is to discuss whether sincerity is all that is required to please God, and I am interested in what you believe concerning this matter. [Let householder comment.] It is interesting to see what Jesus said about this matter, and in reading Matthew 7 :21 one common misconception is cleared up. [Read and explain.] It is seen, therefore, that sincerity alone is not the measurement, but, rather, whether one is doing God’s will. The purpose of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is to help one learn more about the will of God, and it directs you to the Bible to answer questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Talks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">(Cout'fZ)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">marked. These are the ideas the audience should have well in mind when they go home. Speakers should use ihe material outlined below the main points to develop these key ideas and not use the subpoints as if they were other main ideas. Likewise, scriptures and illustrations should all focus on and support the main points of the talk. Mark these main points clearly ou the outline from which you speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> There is even more that can be done. It is advantageous to emphasize our main points by repeating them. While developing a main point, there will be many opportunities for emphasis by repetition. Certainly before going on to a new main point, it is helpful to repeat again the main point just developed, relate it to the title, the theme of the talk, and then pause for change of thought. Please see S2, K84-86, and P3 in “Progressive Speech Training.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>G</sup> A. certain amount of time is allotted on the outline for each main point. Develop the subpoints as a whole within that time. You do not need to allot equal time to each subpoint; some will get more attention than others ; they are suggestive and may be cut in number if necesand supply information about how to please God.” Offer subscription.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Another: “Good morning. My name is ------. The purpose of iny</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">visit is to discuss with you the question, What is required to please God? Most people are very much interested in pleasing God, aren’t they? You probably have heard it said that it does not make any difference how one worships God as long as be is sincere. In Ilie Bible at Matthew 7: 21 Jesus tells us . . . [Read and explain.] I have found </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> to be very helpful in gaining an understanding of what God’s will is, and I would like to offer you a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible journal on a contribution of just $1.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> By being unhurried in your delivery and drawing the householder out at opportune times during your presentation, you too will have many fine experiences in presenting subscriptions for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.'</span><span class="font10"> magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">sary. The important thing is to put across the main point.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Our main ideas are developed with the aid of scriptures. The key texts should be thoroughly explained. Do not simply “read and run.” Take time to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">dixcutx</span><span class="font10"> those aspects of the scripture that are related to the main point. Of course, not every scripture is a key one in the talk; some merely throw light on a key text you are explaining. Also, when we choose to have the audience follow along with a scripture we are going to discuss, there is no need to give a Bible page number every time; use page numbers only when they are really needed, as when referring to a small Bible book seldom consulted by most persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> So if all who give talks clarify the main points in their own minds and conscientiously impress them on the minds of those in the audience, if they emphasize the title of the talk by tying arguments in to it, and if they take time to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">discuss</span><span class="font10"> key scriptures, public talks will be more effective, because all will go home with valuable information firmly fixed in mind. In turn, they will be better equipped to teach others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Does a schedule for service build up activity? We are confident that it does. Improved scheduling on your part has resulted in our again reaching the ten-hour goal in November, as we did in October. This despite bad weather in some parts of the country. Bible studies increased 2,289 over October. Fine! In magazine placements we almost met the goal of twelve, which was a fine improvement over last November. Keep on sticking to a well-balanced schedule of service so as to share in all features of service each week. We can confidently expect our ministry to be blessed as we do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are now 725 special pioneers in the United States. This is excellent! W’hat a joy to see so many energetic workers in this field. Can you be a pioneer and work toward the special pioneer service?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OCTOBER, 1964 “Filled with the holy spirit and ... speaking the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31. VOL. VII NO. 10</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">^Deaii</span><span class="font14"> ^ab&amp;slie/is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our report for the service year of 1964, just completed, shows that we helped many people to flee from Babylon the Great. Just think, this past year, in our U.S. Branch territory alone, 19,781 were baptized! All this ingathering boosted our average number of regular publishers to 292,318, which is 4.4 percent over last year, and the peak in publishers reached 315,568. That’s a fine report, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Can you imagine how much talking these brothers and sisters of ours did during the past twelve months? 47,452,222 hours were spent in explaining the good news to others. If you had to do that all by yourself, with no time out for eating and sleeping, it would take you over 5,416 years. How grand it is that we have all been able to work together to accomplish it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now we are anxious to know how all of Jehovah’s people earth-wide did in their ministry this past year, but for that full report we will have to wait for the 1965 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Getting back to our territory, we must mention the excellent activity of our pioneers. They did about one-third of the preaching work as far as hours are concerned, and they did it, with only one twenty-secondth of ail the publishers! Can you imagine it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We all have good reason to rejoice with you pioneers. We appreciate all the help that you have given to the congregations, and we hope that more of our brothers and sisters can join your ranks during the new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We still have plenty of pioneer territory in this country. If you are not yet a pioneer, think about it and the blessings it can mean to you. It may lead you into Bethel service, circuit or district work; perhaps to an assignment in a foreign field. When one makes the step forward, things open up. One does not know where Jehovah will direct when one says, “Here I am! Send me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">October, as you know, is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Are You Entering into the Joy of Your Master?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Many of us will recognize the above words from Jesus’ illustration of the talents. (Matt. 25:23) There are many things we can learn from this illustration, and among them is this point: Joyful rewards are held out to all alert and faithful servants of Jehovah. How reassuring this is in these momentous times!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But perhaps you are wondering at this point: How do we get such a joyful outlook, one that gives us the courage to press on regardless of the circumstances in which we subscription month. We have taken a peek at the second page of the October 8 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and observe that 4,100,000 copies are being printed, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> has reached a circulation of 4,400,000. Bight now we have addresses for 506,148 individual </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscribers right here in the Brooklyn office. In addition to that, we send out 1,857,151 distributors’ copies of each issue from here in 14 languages. The other branches handle the remainder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> being featured during October, particularly the special issue on “The Moral Breakdown—What Can Be Done About It?”, we expect that thousands more subscribers will be added to the list. And, no doubt, there will be a large number of new </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscribers too, because many of you publishers have found that it is often just as easy to obtain the two subscriptions as it is to obtain one. If you need more copies of the special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> for October, we are ready to supply you, because we have one of the two new presses running now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We close with warm love for all of you fine publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom. Together let’s be diligent in declaring the everlasting good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers at</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">find ourselves? Is it not by sharing wholeheartedly in the service, by preparing well for each privilege of service we have and by prayerfully asking Jehovah to bless our efforts with success? Yes, by daily studying God’s Word, associating with his people and serving him in the field we can cultivate the right mental attitude so necessary for joyful service. Do you feel this joy as you participate in the different features of the ministry? Or are there times when you feel rather reluctant to share in service? In any event, we believe you will be encouraged by the following points, designed to help us increase our joy in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> For example, consider the position of the apostles, as outlined in Acts, chapter 5. Bead the entire fifth chapter of Acts at your convenience and you will appreciate even more keenly this one point, that even though the apostles were beaten and persecuted for courageously preaching the good news in very difficult territory their joy sustained them and carried them through. They knew they were doing the divine will. They had the inner conviction that they were serving Jehovah, and this gave them great joy and happiness.—Acts 5: 41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But perhaps you feel that your territory is quite difficult and there are few if any “sheep” there. Even though your territory may seem difficult, do not let this diminish your joy. In a territory that we today would consider most difficult, Isaiah had confidence and joy because of Jehovah’s comforting words. Please read them at Isaiah 65:13 and you will observe the faithful promises of Jehovah. Truly, brothers, it is our attitude, our outlook toward the ministry, that determines our joy to a large extent.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah provides joy in so many (Continued on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">page !p, col.</span><span class="font11"> 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Sister approaches magazineterritory servant. She is in a quandary as to the number of magazines to take, wishes she could figure out more closely her magazine placements. One Magazine Day she places twenty and maybe the next time four. In answer to his question she states she spends about the same amount of time each Magazine Day. Servant asks if she has started magazine route. Receiving a negative reply, he explains to her how easy it is. All that is required is keeping record of householder’s name, address, date of visit, issues placed and notation as to type of householder so two weeks later an article can be selected and featured that will appeal to the householder. Explains advantages of route. On her expressing some doubt, servant suggests they work together on Magazine Day. Arrangements are made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 18:4—Get out of Babylon the Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:4—Blessings for those who flee</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Suggested sermon: ‘Good morning, I am calling on all those who recognize the seriousness of the world situation. ■Jou are no doubt aware of this. [Allow for comment.] Although there are many sincere religious persons in the world, many people agree that one of the factors causing today’s problems has been religion. The Bible reveals the start of false religion and God’s disapproval of it, in Genesis chapter 11. It shows that the people became interested in themselves and worshiped men, rather than God, building a city called Babel and a huge tower to advance false worship. God did not approve of this scheme and Genesis 11:9 tells us what he did. [Read.] Although the people were scattered, they continued to practice false worship. Over the years this developed into a world empire of false religion. Today it is seen practicing unclean things, just as Babel of old, and it is called Babylon the Great at Revelation </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">18:2.</span><span class="font10"> [Read.] It is important for you to acquaint yourself with this matter in order to gain God’s approval. Revelation 18:4 tells you what to do. [Read.] In addition to telling you to get out of Babylon the Great for salvation, the Bible shows you how to do so, and this book “ ‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules!” will help you. Notice what it states on page 9, paragraph 1. [Read.] The Bible assures those that have come out of Babylon the Great of many blessings. [Paraphrase Revelation 21: 4.] This is your copy for only 75c, together with this booklet.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (5 min.) Demonstrates sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Practice with one’ another. Stress theme. Younger and newer publishers should be aided to use the simplified sermon in “Kingdom Ministry” for May 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 79.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Serving Jehovah brings us the greatest of joy and happiness in this life, doesn’t it? And, since we appreciate our relationship to Jehovah our heavenly Father, it is his work that we want to do well, yes, to the very best of our ability. Our desire as Kingdom publishers is to improve our ministry all that we possibly can so that we will be happy and productive in Jehovah’s service. Furthermore, Jehovah has given some of us additional responsibilities as overseers, assistant ministerial servants and study conductors, and, naturally, those of us entrusted with such responsibilities want to do our work well in order that the whole organization may prosper. Really, a great deal depends upon fine servant leadership together with a good working knowledge of one’s responsibilities as a servant. For this reason we are happy to provide some thoughts for improving servant leadership in all the congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It is good for the overseer to work closely with his assistants throughout the year and periodically to spend a month with them to strengthen the organization for further fine works. You have done this in the past, and we suggest you do it again, starting in October. During this month the assistant congregation servant’s responsibilities could come in for some attention, and we recommend that the overseer stress the matter of regularity in Kingdom service and improving sermons. The next month the Bible study servant could be visited, and back-call and Bible study activity could be featured. In December the magazineterritory servant could very likely be given some fine pointers relative</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ All congregations should make arrangements for a special Magazine Day on November 26, which is worldly Thanksgiving Day. Additional magazines needed should be ordered by October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ During the next four weeks service centers should follow this schedule on Sunday morning: October 11, simplified sermon for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> offer. October 18, review of regular </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">sermon. October 25, overcoming local objections raised when </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscription is offered. November 1, placing magazines when main offer is not taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Please endeavor to order now literature you will need for the November and December campaigns. This will allow us to give you better service later for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> and calendar orders. However, do not order the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> and calendar until a notice appears in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Literature offer: November, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">^Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!,</span><span class="font10"> and booklet, for 75c.

<p><span class="font11">to encouraging regular support of Magazine Day, developing magazine routes and proper coverage of territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If you are an overseer, you might now be asking, How much time does the Society recommend spending with these servants during the month? It would be good to spend as much time as possible. An evening could be set aside early in the month to provide encouragement and counsel for improving the work. At that time problems can be entertained and definite plans made for expansion and improving effectiveness. Confer together frequently during the month and work together in the field ministry. We sincerely believe that all assistant servants and conductors will greatly appreciate the help, counsel and skillful direction given by all you overseers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> And, would it not be a splendid idea for all overseers to examine their own activities and knowledge of congregation organization from time to time? Yes, this would be a fitting arrangement, and so we recommend that each overseer review the following articles for building up the maturity and effectiveness of the congregation: June, July and August 1964 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> on “The Assistance Arrangement” ; February, July and August 1963 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> on “Strengthening the Service Centers” as well as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of May 1, 1962, and July 15, 1963. Surely, with this arrangement in operation, each one of us will be able to do Jehovah’s work well, resulting in increased joy and happiness to us and greater praise to our heavenly Father.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture </span><span class="font10">Is Inspired of God and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Beneficial” </span><span class="font10">with two booklets, for $2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ Hungarian “Watchtower.” Because of translation problems there was a delay in publication of the Hungarian </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> However, these problems are now being solved and magazine issues are appearing once more. It will be in order to continue taking subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Any who can vacation pioneer in December are urged to do so. Why not send your application in now, either for two weeks or a full month, and be among those who will share in this enriching experience?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">—English, Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Your Speech Upbuilding?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Why is it that we are attracted to some persons more than to others? Often it is because their thoughts and conversation are upbuilding and thus they are cheerful, encouraging individuals. How, then, can we use this knowledge to good advantage in our ministry? One way is by being certain that our sermons have this quality of being upbuilding. A sermon that is upbuilding and that stresses the positive aspects of the truth will do more to attract other persons than a sermon that is negative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> True, it is necessary to expose false religious doctrines and point out the bad deeds of the world. Also, Jehovah’s judgments must be pronounced and we must warn of Armageddon’s destruction. But it is not necessary to dwell on these things to such an extent that they overshadow the blessings of God’s new order, which lovers of righteousness long to hear about.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> So why not always seek to be truly upbuilding in our sermons? Keep in mind the commission found at Isaiah 61. Here, among other things, we are told to “bind up the brokenhearted” and to “comfort all the mourning ones.” This is done by joyfully talking about the many good things God has promised for those who love him. Talk about the happiness that one can have now in knowing and doing the divine will and also the everlasting joys to be experienced after Armageddon. These are the things to highlight.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In order to accomplish this, what we need is good balance. For example, when telling of Armageddon and its destructive results, we can skillfully weave in an explanation of how the Kingdom will bring about a. new order of things. In our new sermon for October we will talk about the critical times in which we live. In doing so the badness can be mentioned briefly, but the emphasis can be placed on how this is a sign of the last days and fulfills prophecy. Fulfilled prophecy, in turn, shows that God’s kingdom is at hand. Thus, the news we bring is good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Not only should the material in our sermons be upbuilding, but our delivery should be encouraging and positive. At Acts 4:31 we are told that the early Christians “were speaking the word of God with boldness.” They had the truth and they knew it, so they spoke with conviction. We should too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Keeping these thoughts in mind at all times will give us assurance that our speech will be upbuilding, not only in the field ministry, but in all of our conversation.—Col. 4: 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We are always happy at the end of a day’s ministry when we have been able to talk to someone about the Kingdom hope or place literature for that one to read later. Our ability to overcome objections successfully will help us to enjoy this pleasure more often.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When you offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription and someone says, “I HAVE TOO MANY MAGAZINES,” do you feel that the conversation is ended? It need not be.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One publisher replied: “Do you have opportunity to read the magazines you are getting? Is there any particular article you read recently that you enjoyed very much?” After the householder’s reply the publisher continued: “Have you ever read an article that tells what will finally stop war and bring peace? This is one of the reasons people enjoy reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> It not only reports on the difficulties in the world, but it shows the remedy—the remedy the Bible gives.

Why, even our placing of a magazine, book or booklet lights up our faces with joy, for we know that the one who receives this good information will be blessed if he will read and apply it. And how our joy increases as we study with interested persons and aid them to get an accurate knowledge of the truth! Finally, oui’ joy is overflowing when we accompany interested persons to the Kingdom Hall, where they can associate with Jehovah’s men of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Now we keenly anticipate the blessings of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> campaign.

She saw the point and accepted the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If the householder declines to take the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription because, as he says, “I HAVE NO MONEY,” see if it is a case of having no money right now. It may be that you can come back later and get the contribution. If this is agreeable, fill out the subscription slip right then and let the householder initial it. It will help the householder to keep his promise to contribute for the subscription later. Send the subscription to the Society after you receive the contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If</span><span class="font11"> the interested person is not able to make a money contribution for the subscription, be alert to trade for something of comparable value. In the fall of the year many have produce or other items they will be glad to trade if you make known that you are willing to trade. As you offer subscriptions, have a positive approach. It will aid you to enjoy the pleasure of presenting the good news to more people in your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">How should Christians view contributing to &quot;'charitable organizations”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each one must decide for himself whether to give to some “charitable organization” or not. By supporting the Christian ministry, he is, of course, already personally engaged in a charitable work of the highest kind. In deciding whether to contribute to other causes, there are certain Scriptural matters that one ought to take into consideration. For example, a dedicated Christian must at all times keep in mind his dedication to God, which includes using his time, energy and all other resources in harmony with that dedication. If there is going to be a use of the money he donates in some way that conflicts with Scriptural principles, then the dedicated Christian could not conscientiously give to such a cause. Nor could he donate to a false religious organization or to an organization controlled by a false religion, for to do so would be a violation of the command recorded at Revelation 18:4. A Christian will not be moved by fear of what others think so that he lends support to organizations and activities that are out of harmony with God.</span></p>

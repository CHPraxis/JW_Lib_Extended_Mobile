<p><span class="font10">After breakfast here at Bethel on June 8 it was a pleasure to hear Brother Knorr’s report about his recent three-week visit to Europe. He encouraged the Bethel Family with the news that all the branches in Europe, except two, reached new publisher peaks in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A highlight of his trip was a meeting for more than two days with seventeen European branch servants and other branch overseers who had gathered at Wiesbaden, Germany. Brother Knorr explained to them many details about new organizational arrangements in regard to elders. The meeting also provided opportunity to discuss problems in connection with the expansion of the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From Wiesbaden, Brother Knorr went to Rome, where he gave the dedication talk for the newly constructed branch building. These facilities are greatly needed, Italy having reached a new publisher peak of 25,453 in April. He also spoke at a stadium in Rome and 15,700 persons turned out on short notice for the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Barcelona, in Spain, he spoke at the dedication of the Society’s branch, a six-story remodeled building. So fast is the work moving ahead in Spain that 117 new Kingdom Halls have been opened in the past year. Spain’s April peak was 16,298 publishers, a 25-percent Increase over last year! Brother Knorr spoke too at a.meeting in the Barcelona bullring, with 13,356 in attendance. It was the biggest meeting of Jehovah’s people ever held in Spain! So delighted were the brothers at being able to meet freely in such a large assembly that after song and after prayer they burst into spontaneous applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have been very busy here at Bethel, presently running a night shift in the bindery. So far this service year we have produced over </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">22}</span><span class="font10"> million books and Bibles, but we have on hand orders for about 14 million more! As this letter is written the time for the first of the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Any opportunity to assemble with our brothers and join in giving praise to Jehovah is a joyful occasion. The month of July offers many such opportunities, some of them very special.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Most of us will be traveling to attend one of the “Divine Rulership” District Assemblies. Ordinarily,- when a family takes a summer trip, the most talked about mementos are the souvenirs and snapshots of the places they visited. In our case, if the assembly is the primary purpose of our trip, what will dominate our conversations afterward? Won’t it be recollections of the many spiritual good things learned from the program? The assembly will surely give us much to talk about for months to come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our appreciation for the privilege of praising Jehovah in assembly with others at congregation meetings should prompt us to avoid allowing distractions of the summer months to disrupt this wholesome custom that we have maintained through the winter. In our part of the world July marks the beginning of summertime activities such as vacations and many forms of recreation. It will take advance planning and determination to make sure that “the house of our God” suffers no neglect during this period.—Neh. 10:39.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There will be many opportunities for diversion, especially on the weekends. While it is certainly beneficial for the family to have refreshing recreation, isn't it true that the greater need for spiritual refreshment ought to prompt us to avoid planning activities that prevent attendance at meetings?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">district assemblies Is close. What a grand opportunity we will have to praise Jehovah heartily in assemblies! Don't miss any of the program !</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If we go on vacation, it would be a fine thing if we could still attend meetings. Wherever we go, very likely we can locate the Kingdom Hall in that community. In most cases, the address can be found in the local phone book; otherwise, the Society can provide it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Because of the rich benefits of the family study, appreciative family members will hesitate to get involved In activities that crowd out time for it. When planning what the family will do, since you already have set a time for the family study, why not arrange other affairs around it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> There are many sheeplike ones with whom we study who very much need the many benefits of assembly with those who have strong faith. It would show our sincere concern about them if we would make sure that we did not allow our busy schedule to cause us to cancel their weekly study. If we are away for any length of time, could we arrange for others to care for them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Field service activity during July will feature the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book and emphasize starting studies to help still others to assemble with us in praising Jehovah. About 45 million copies of this book have been sent out all over the world! The edition now being printed will raise the total to over 50 million. Since this book became the most widely used book in our Bible study program, about 450,000 persons have been baptized! That is an average of about one new publisher for every 100 books distributed. Of course, other publications have also been widely distributed and have contributed a great deal to this increase. We have especially appreciated the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book because it has proved to be such a powerful instrument to awaken sincere ones to the hopelessness in associating with this old system, and also to the rich </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">8 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: “Small, but Powerful.” Enthusiastic talk. Inform the congregation about territories that have not been worked recently and suggest that they talk to the brother who assigns territory about some they could work during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Praising Jehovah in Assemblies.’’ Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Family Contributions to Congregation Spirituality.” Two families visit together; activities of the congregation are the topic of conversation. The two family heads are pleased with the good effort made by their households but they feel there is more they can do to help the congregation grow stronger spiritually. They reason that congregation spirituality is actually the result of the operation of Jehovah’s spirit upon those within it, and its members can help best by simply cultivating the fruitage of that spirit in their personal lives. To the extent that each family unit can do that, the congregation will be strengthened. These brothers lead their families in lively, informal discussion of the article, encouraging each family member to express himself on ways that the suggestions can be personally applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This discussion prompts parents to comment about the responsibility they have to take the lead and be diligent in their oversight of spiritual matters in the home. Observation Is made that each household should have a definite program to keep the family strong. Suggestion is made that all turn to the “Aid’’ book (page 312. par. 6) to review the fundamentals of instruction maintained in the ancient Israelite household and which proved to be successful in keeping the family united in true worship. Children join in discussion, expressing their willingness to cooperate with parents. Session concludes with comments on how the w'hole congregation would benefit if each family would strengthen its spirituality by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding remarks. Briefly relate experiences found on page 25 in the April 8, 1972, “Awake!” as time permits; also, comment on slogan appearing at the bottom of page 4. Song 99.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">30 min: Review of the “Divine Rulership” District Assembly. (This program can be rescheduled according to the dates of your assembly.) To bo effective, this program will require advance preparation. Capable ones should be encouraged to take notes on assigned portions of the program. Invite them t6 relate new things learned and counsel that has special application locally. Include outstanding experiences and notable comments made by newspapers or on TV. Ask teen-agers and children to make expression about things that impressed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding remarks. Include appropriate Announcements from page 3. Discuss the privilege of sharing in the work of Kingdom-preaching. Song 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Since practically every congregation will miss one service meeting due to the district assembly, one program has been eliminated, we leave it up to each congregation to reschedule the service meetings according to the dates of the assembly attended by the brothers locally.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Offering the “Great Teacher” Book. August will mark the first time this book has been featured as the main offer; a wide distribution can accomplish much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are numerous ways to offer it Presentations that are simple and direct usually get the best response. ■When talking to parents, you can appeal to their natural concern about the welfare and future of their family. If you wish to use a scripture, you could refer to Proverbs 22:6 or perhaps Ephesians 6:4, emphasizing the mutual blessings to be gained by a personal interest in their children. (Some excellent talking points are found on pages 5 and 6.) The illustration on page 1 may prompt a concerned parent to think seriously about why he should imitate Jesus’ loving Interest and take advantage of the help provided by this “Great Teacher.” You could mention the disturbing emotional pressures confronting young people in this chaotic society and draw attention to the vital lessons they need to learn from their parents. Various chapters in the book focus on such qualities as faith in God (chap. 3), obedience (chap. 7), forgiveness (chap. 15), truthfulness (chap. 17), love for others (chap. 19), peaceableness (chap. 32), and generosity (chap. 35). (Briefly review additional suggestions offered in the June “Kingdom Ministry,” page 2.) Demonstrate one or two brief presentations as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encourage publishers to carry extra copies with them, being alert to offer more than one when several in the family show interest. Also, suggest the possibility of making just a simple offer of the book for 25 cents when the householder is busy. Comment on the fine opportunity available for younger publishers to share in a wide distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">30 min: Why Faith Is Needed. (“Aid,” pp. 561, 562) Audience discussion, using the questions here. Our entire life course as servants of Jehovah should be governed by faith. This will enable us to overcome mountainlike obstacles that would hinder our serving him. So it is good for us to consider just what faith is, why it is needed and how it can aid us to preserve a proper relationship with our heavenly Father, (a) What is faith? (“Aid, p. 561, pars. 2-4) (b) Why is faith in Jehovah’s existence not enough to gain his approval? (Heb. 11:6: Jas. 2:19) (c) Why is it important for us to have faith in the power of prayer? (Matt. 21:21, 22; Luke 18:7, 8; Jas. 1:5-8) (d) How can the faith of others encourage us to endure affliction or persecution? (Heb. 13:7) (e) When faced with opposition from family members, what will faith enable us to do and why? (Matt. 10:34-39; Jas. 1:2-4) (f) How can one put up a hard fight for the faith when faced with temptation to commit immorality? (1 Cor. 6:18; Jude 3-7, 20, 21) (g) How will strong faith affect our view of secular work? (1 Tim. 6:7-10) (h) To withstand economic pressures, in what must we have faith? (Ps. 37:25; Heb. 13:5, 6) (i) Why will faith in Jehovah help us to avoid stumbling others or being stumbled by what imperfect humans do or say? (Ps. 119:165; Rom. 14:13-15, 21-23) (j) How can faith help young people to avoid becoming unduly involved in extracurricular activities at school? (1 Tim. 4:8; 1 John 2:15-17; 5:4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">May saw a fine demonstration of wholehearted effort to “let people know the prophetic truths.” There were 429,698 who shared in publicly making known those prophetic truths, and that represents an increase of more than 15,000 over May of last year! We rejoice to see them share with us in the most vital work being performed on the earth today. During the month, 560,121 books were placed, a large percentage of them no doubt being “ ’The Nations Shall Know that 1 Am Jehovah’—How?”, which so forcefully emphasizes God’s prophetic purpose as respects his own name. A nne witness was given! .</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Family Contributions to Congregation Spirituality</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Much emphasis has been placed on the need for maintaining spirituality in the congregation. For various reasons, you may feel that you are very limited in what you can contribute toward this effort. You may have concluded that concern for such matters rests with the overseers. Could it lie that you are overlooking a fine opportunity to help, one that is available to you and members of your family right in your home? Tire congregation is composed primarily of families; strong spirituality in the family, therefore, contributes immeasurably toward maintaining this quality in the congregation. Your family, regardless of circumstances, can directly help toward achieving this objective. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A discerning and well balanced family appreciates the provisions made by its head, whether they are material things, recreation or Bible instruction. When the family has cultivated such an appreciation, then every provision made by the Head of the congregation, Christ Jesus, will also be gratefully received by taking full advantage of every meeting, assignment or privilege of service in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If good habits of personal and family study are maintained in the household, the family will also have strong appreciation for congregation meetings. The family’s keen interest and participation In these meetings will be an encouragement to others, inciting them “to love and fine works.”—Ileb. 10: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In a home where the headship of the dedicated Christian father is respected and his guidance in family affairs is acknowledged, there is unity of thought and action to get things done. Such a family will be respectful and cooperative with the older men in the congregation, giving them much joy in fulfilling their responsibilities as shepherds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> The family is blessed when the spirit of love predominates in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Praising Jehovah in Assemblies </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">blessings they can enjoy in praising Jehovah In assembly with his people. What a pleasure It will be once again to offer this fine study aid during July.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Regularly assembling together to praise Jehovah “in the intimate group of upright ones” constitutes an integral and vital part of true worship. (Ps. 111:1) July offers many rewarding opportunities to meet together, and if we are determined in our efforts to attend and also help others to do so we will have much cause to rejoice. household and each one shows a ready willingness to overlook the shortcomings of others. Peace and unity result, and this in turn exerts a strong influence toward helping family members to display this same spirit toward others in the congregation. When these qualities flourish among the brothers, a warm and happy relationship prevails for the upbuilding of everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> Jehovah instructs us to govern our lives by the principles set forth in his Word. When the family makes sincere effort to do so, it will resist worldly thinking and the fads of dress, attitude and conduct that such things encourage. A congregation composed of many such families will have few problems requiring counsel or discipline by the overseers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Family members that have made a practice of being kind, thoughtful and sincerely concerned about one another will be inclined to manifest these same fine qualities toward everyone in the congregation. This assures that a warm, loving interest will be shown toward those needing encouragement and whatever assistance such ones need will very likely be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> The family that really appreciates what Jehovah has promised and senses the urgency of the times will be motivated to share Its faith with others. In a congregation made up of such families, there will rarely be a lack of support for field service activity or a need to give constant reminders about the importance of regular participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Finally, and perhaps most important, the family that is spiritually strong and fully devoted to Jehovah will be able to acquire the endurance needed to resist successfully any adversity that threatens its well-being.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> In view of the foregoing, it becomes apparent that all of us (fathers, mothers and children) can help in building a spiritually strong congregation. While the overseers can assist by giving encouragement and direction, real progress depends upon what we do individually and as a family. One of the most successful efforts to build spirituality in the congregation begins in the home. When each family member personally cultivates the wholesome elements of spirituality, the whole congregation will ultimately reflect these same qualities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Families that harmoniously work together to increase the love, appreciation and spirituality within the family circle make one of the strongest and most lasting contributions toward the spiritual growth of the whole congregation.</span></p></li></ul>

Of course, be alert to take advantage of any opportunity to start studies where interest is found.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> During the summer many congregations will be working territory that is not covered so often. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font10"> 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Indecisive Ones</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The rapidly unfolding events each day prove without question that the end of this </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">system drfl</span><span class="font10">gg perilously close and*'Tt Is urgent </span><span class="font9">that shcOplIke uties act decisively toward the requirements of true worship. Those who prove to be </span><span class="font10">indecisive and who hold back cannot expect to “receive anything from Jehovah.” (Jas. 1:6-8) As we study with such ones, what can we do to help them to appreciate the need for positive action?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First, a consistent effort to read and study God’s Word is essential for progress. (John 17:3) Does the student prepare for his weekly study? Impress upon him the importance of such for his advancement. Encourage him to develop good habits by reading the latest magazines, the daily text and new publications as they are received. Promote his interest in things studied at the meetings and suggest that he read the source material himself at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Second, application of Bible principles learned is likewise necessary. If one learns of his responsibility but fails to accept it, he takes a course that can only lead to disappointment. (Jas. 1: 22-25) Has the student been Indecisive about breaking free from false religious beliefs, immoral practices or worldly Involvements that disqualify him for baptism? If he has progressed to the point where it is time to do so, do not hesitate to make clear his responsibility before Jehovah. Be tactful, yet straightforward, clearly showing what he must do to please Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Third, association with Jehovah’s people by attendance at meetings is a necessity if he is to grow strong spiritually. (Heb. 10: 24, 25) If the student neglects his opportunities to attend, try to help him to realize what he is missing. Tell him about the vital things learned there such as Information studied in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book or current issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font10">Introduce him to others in the congregation. Use God’s Word to build up his courage if he is fearful of what his family or friends will do. Kindly offer any assistance that you' can to provide transportation. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Fourth, knowledge of the truth should prompt a believer to share his faith with others. (Rom. 10:10) Are you encouraging the student to do so? You can suggest that he discuss with other family members or friends what he has learned. If you provide a few tracts or handbills, he may take the Initiative to distribute them himself. A simple explanation of how the work is done may allay his fears and give him needed confidence. When you are sure he qualifies, give him a positive invitation to accompany you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Are we trying to “push” people into Jehovah’s service? No, not at all. Jehovah is pleased only with voluntary obedience motivated by the heart. (Matt. 12:34) Our commission is simply to help people to see clearly the issues involved and the steps necessary to meet the requirements for God’s approval. If our sincere effort to assist them falls to prompt a reasonable response, undoubtedly our time could be used more profitably in studying with others more inclined to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We appreciate that their lives are at stake, so we have good reason to analyze our teaching methods to make sure we are reaching the heart. Because we love them and want them to enjoy the blessings of eternal life, we long to hear them say: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.”—Josh. 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Small, bul Powerful &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">distribution of many of these books in such territory would be a good thing. Where more than ordinaryinterest is shown, you may wish to offer more than one book, especially if it is unlikely that the territory will be worked again for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Make your plans now for a full share. The congregation can check its supply of books to make sure that sufficient are on hand to provide adequately for the needs of publishers and pioneers associated. Take advantage of the good weather and long days to expand your field service activity. A good distribution of these small, but powerful instruments will surely do much to expose false doctrines and motivate sincere ones to acquire the “mark” necessary for survival.—Ezek. 9: 4.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font9">• How can all help to keep meetings from going overtime?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Meetings of the congregation should be conducted In an orderly way, with all things taking place “decently and by arrangement.&quot; (1 Cor. 14:40) This includes keeping meetings within designated time limits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everyone can help by arriving early and being promptly seated before the program begins. All meetings should start on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Proper timing of the program itself begins with adequate preparation. It is helpful if talks and demonstrations are carefully rehearsed. When it is necessary to Include special letters or reports, time allotments can be adjusted in advance. Lengthy and repetitious announcements are often unnecessary. Brothers who exceed the time allotted for their assignments on the service meeting can be given appropriate counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The &quot;Watchtower&quot; study conductor will usually find it best to apportion the material to be covered, determining how much time Is to be allotted to each section and then adhering closely to that during the study. He can keep his own comments brief. Comments from the audience are usually best when they are brief and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Theocratic Ministry School, student talks can be promptly terminated when the allotted time is up. If instruction speakers go overtime, they can be counseled privately. The school servant can help by keeping his remarks reasonably brief and limiting counsel on student talks to two minutes. When everyone cooperates, meetings can usually be kept within the allotted time.</span></p>

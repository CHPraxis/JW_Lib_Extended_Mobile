<p><span class="font10">Looking over our April report, we find much to make our hearts rejoice. First, there was a new high of 431,179 publishers, 6.8G8 more than the peak registered in March and 14,390 more publishers than April a year ago! Isn’t it grand that there are this many people interested in magnifying .Jehovah’s name by sharing in the Kingdom service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">April was a big magazine month, and we had two special issues along with other fine ones. What did we do witli them? We put them into the hands of the public to the number of 9,888,120! Just think how much good they can do. During the four-month subscription campaign, 475,982 subscriptions were also ob-Jjtined. For the most part, these new ascriptions are going to households from which no one is coming to our meetings. Really, what a fine witness was given, aiding others to break clean from false religion and to fix their hope on God's new order so near at hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a springboard for our April work we had the special public talk and the Memorial late in March. Total Memorial attendance rose to 976,233—an 8.3-percent increase, or 75,038 more persons than last year! Isn’t that encouraging? The number of partakers decreased by 37. for a total of 4,559. The Memorial truly impressed on our minds how the Lord Jesus set the example in vindicating God by maintaining integrity. Also, there was a new peak attendance of 689,878 at the special talk, an increase of 15,076 over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You are to be commended for your fine share in theocratic activity. Now we have another grand privilege before us, that of attending one of the “Divine Rulership” District Assemblies. Surely we will not want to miss this marvelous spiritual feast! Indeed, we have many things to make our hearts rejoice. How blessed are those who main-• tain integrity!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Where can truth be found? Jesus said, &quot;You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” We, as Jehovah's witnesses and disciples of Jesus, know that the vital truth Jesus was talking about can be found only in God's Word. It contains the sayings of everlasting life. &quot;Your word is truth,&quot; was the testimony of Jesus in prayer to his heavenly Father. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Yet, </span><span class="font10">w</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e also know that the vast majorit</span><span class="font10">y oT people living in the world have &quot;noT’ljepn ■S'et fr&lt;&gt;e by the truth. They afS y£t tn bondage to This world and the “ruler of the world,” Satan the Devil, despite the fact that the Bible has the greatest circulation of any book in the world. In Christendom, practically every home has at least one copy. But understanding it is a different matter. We want people to understand it and find the truth that leads to life.—John 8:32; 17:3, 17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During June Jehovah’s people will appropriately be featuring copies of God’s Word as they present the good news.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In nearly every home there are children. Even if parents have not taken too much interest in Bible-related matters in recent years, perhaps we can reach them through their children by means of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> book. Most will recognize the importance of imparting to their children some training and background knowledge rooted in the Bible. Let's take advantage of this and show them how to study with their children, as we skillfully use this approach to encourage the parents to join the study. In starting a study, we will keep things simple so the children will understand, but always directing things in such a way as to kindle the interest and curiosity of the parents. Later we may be able to start a study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book witli the parents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> While we will be quite busy during June preparing for the district assemblies, most of which will lie in July and August, we want to keep busy in the preaching work, too. Did it not make you happy to learn that close to 150,000 throughout the world were baptized last year? There are still sheeplike persons in our territory. Jehovah has not yet closed the door of opportunity. Many are fleeing from Babylon the Great and some of these are “sighing and groaning” because of what they have seen in Christendom, which claims to represent God. If we are out preaching and are alert to start studies in order to teach these sincere ones, we can lie assured that Jehovah will bless our efforts to share In the ingathering work.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Let Men Know the Truth. —John 8:32. Song 95.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Introduction, text and comments. Discuss Branch Letter and Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: “Showing Thankfulness for the Truth.” Question-and-answer discussion. In discussing paragraph 2, demonstrate presentation of offer. Publishers may want to build presentation of “New World Translation” around a Scripture text such as John 17:3 or 2 Timothy 3:14-17. Another presentation can feature “Great Teacher” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: “Presenting the Good News.” Talk and discussion with audience. Receive suggestions from audience as to how the various Bibles and special aids can be used to help interested ones in the congregation’s territory. 17 min: Concluding comments. (Include how congregation did in field ministry during May.) Discuss article in June 15, 1972, “Watchtower” on “How Does Your Status with God Affect Your Children?” Song 97.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Let Faith Move You to Obedient Action. Song 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: “Generosity Begets Generosity.” Talk on article in May 15, 1972, issue of “The Watchtower.” Include appropriate comments on how the congregation is doing in meeting its financial obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: “Assembly Time Is Here!” Questions and answers. As time permits, include practical points from June 15, 1970, issue of “The Watchtower,” pages 380-382. Emphasize importance of letting love govern our conduct and relations with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">17 min: Placing and Using the “Great Teacher” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(12 min.) Demonstrate starting of study in “Great Teacher” book after placement on first call. Publisher has just placed book with parents of three children. He now offers to show parents how to study “Great Teacher” book with children. They read together pages 5 and 6 and discuss the procedure employed in the book for involving the children by means of questions. Then the study is demonstrated by going into Chapter 1, mentioning that it is just a short four pages. At the end of the study they read from the “New World Translation” the Scripture texts cited at the end of the chapter. Arrangements are made to return for further discussion next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(5 min.) Chairman briefly discusses other ways “Great Teacher” book can be featured: Grandparents and others can give copies of it as gifts to child relatives, if no children are now in home; or gifts can be made to children of close friends. This may be just the way to reach a certain family you know. If person has poor education, book can oe used to help him learn truth, as well as to improve his reading and comprehension. Sometimes might show book to young person if parents are not at home, and then return to see parents later. Offering book in street witnessing is also effective. Take advantage of all opportunities to place the “Great Teacher” book and the “New World Translation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Offer the “Truth” Book in July. Has everyone in your territory had the opportunity to get the “Truth” book? To make sure, we will make a special effort to cover all the territory in July with this fine Bible study aid. Where you find that individuals already have it, you might want to offer either the “Great Teacher” or “Evolution” book. Of course, you will want to be alert to start studies in the “Truth” book where they have it already. The important thing is that they have in their hands an instrument that will hold their attention and help them to learn the truth. One publication may interest them more than another. Hence, in addition to taking along with you a good supply of the “Truth” book, take along several copies of the other two books as alternative offers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">30 min: The Godly Quality of Kindness. (“Aid,” pp. 993-995) By means of the following questions, help the audience to see why it is important to cultivate kindness. It will not be necessary to have all the scriptures read. Be sure, however, that the key points in the texts used are made clear. Time the discussion so that each question gets a fair share of the time allotted, (a) What is kindness? (“Aid,” p. 993, par. 12) (b) What is undeserved kindness? (Rom. 4:4; “Aid,” pp. 994, 995) (c) Why should those wanting God’s approval reflect kindness? (Job 6:14; Mic. 6:8; Gal. 5:22) (d) What should motivate us to express kindness? (Matt. 6:1-4;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 Cor. 13:4) (e) How can kindness help us in our attitude toward our own family members who may offend us? (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:12, 13) (f) What reasoning respecting Jehovah’s undeserved kindness can help us to resist temptation? (Gal. 2:20, 21; Eph. 1:7;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2 Cor. 6:1) (g) Why is it foolish to presume on God’s undeserved kindness by engaging in loose conduct? (Jude 4-7) (h) How do young folks in the world often show a lack of kindness toward others of their own age? In what way can Christian youths show kindness to those of their age group? to older persons? (Rom. 3:13, 14; 1 Tim. 5:1, 2) (i) Why will appreciation of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness move us to be diligent in declaring the good news? (Acts 20:24; 1 Cor. 15:10) (j) Why is kindness so very important within one’s own family? How can a husband show it toward his wife? a wife toward her husband? (Prov. 31:26; 1 Pet. 3:1-7) 10 min: Concluding comments. Song 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Heartily Praise Jehovah in Assemblies. Song 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Singapore Suppresses Christian Minority.” Talk based on article in June J, 1972, “Watchtower.” Discuss what has happened in Singapore and outline arrangements for brothers to write letters in behalf of our brothers in Singapore. With this being assembly season, all have busy schedule. In addition to publishers making individual arrangements, perhaps servants can make arrangements for several group efforts to get letters written and sent to the officials named in the article.—1 Cor. 12:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Have You Taught Your Children to Work?” Talk and interviews based on article in May 8, 1972, “Awake!” In making practical points, interview parents and children who have been applying these in a home training schedule regularly with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “How Do You View the ‘Field’?” Questions and answers. Invite audience to look up Scripture texts cited and quoted in article and to comment on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Include few comments on theme for month of July, “Heartily Praise Jehovah in Assemblies.” Song 64.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Assembly Time Is Here!</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Will the district assembly you attend this summer be your first, or have you attended many assemblies since becoming associated with Jehovah’s people? In either case, we are sure you will find the program at the “Divine Rulership” assemblies this summer of special, interest. You will not want to rnis.*^ any of it. The program has been arranged with particular emphasis on the needs of Jehovah’s people in the closing days of this time of the end. As the discourses are given and the dramas unfold, you will undoubtedly agree that you would have missed invaluable encouragement and instruction had you not attended. Be sure to attend all four days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The assemblies have been arranged with your convenience in mind. A few congregations have been invited to attend an assembly a little farther away than the nearest one due to limitations of accommodations (see the May </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kinydom Ministry).</span><span class="font10"> Even so, for most congregations it will be a matter of traveling only a hundred miles or so. Throughout the United States there will be sixty assemblies at fifty-seven different locations. If you will need rooming accommodations we invite you to send in for them right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Are travel arrangements completed? Do you have room in your automobile for a pioneer, for a family that does not have a car, for an elderly brother or sister who • needs special help, for an interested person who wants to attend? Make their joy complete as you share in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on paye 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How Do You View the &quot;Field&quot;?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said, “The field is the wx&gt;rld.” It is a tremendous area in wliith the preaching of the Kingdom good news is being done. From a small beginning in 1919, the faithful anointed remnant has worked vigorously during this harvest period and has not passed up any opportunity to spread the preaching into more remote parts of the field. Now the people in 20&quot; lands have the good news readily available to them.—Matt. 13:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To you, the individual Kingdom publisher, your part of the “field” is your congregation territory, or more specifically, the small section assigned to you. How do you view it? As a “territory” on a map, to be covered or worked? Or do you view it as a community of people, living souls who have their individual affections, hopes, desires, sorrows and needs, and who want to live, not die? Do you view them as creations of God, sprung from one made originally in God’s image and likeness, creatures whom He dearly loves and to whom even In this late hour he is still holding out the opportunity of salvation?—John 3: 16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do you have the feeling that God and his Son have toward the People in your community? God said of Nineveh: “Ought I not to feel</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly Time Is Here! </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font10">this greater happiness of giving in their behalf.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> It is good to remind ourselves of the importance of being thoughtful and considerate. We are Jehovah’s people. When we get together we want to reflect this fact wholeheartedly, both at the assembly grounds and throughout the assembly city. By the way we conduct ourselves, we bring honor or dishonor to Jehovah’s great name. Each assembly has been planned so as to have ample seating and space for moving around. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, moderate overcrowding may occur in some places. But by being patient in cafeteria lines, cooperating with attendants, taking the lead “in showing honor to one another,” we will cause others to say, “God is really among you.”—Rom. 12:10; 1 Cor. 14:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> We can also be considerate with regard to the saving of seats. When we place objects on blocks of seats, is this really &quot;keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your wn matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others&quot;? (Phil. 2: 4) You will no doubt agree that, to the contrary, it is actually selfish. Sometimes in the past seats sorry for Nineveh the great city, in which there exist more than one hundred and twenty thousand men who do not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left?&quot; And of Jesus’ attitude toward the people of Israel to whom he preached it is recorded: &quot;On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” His love for them prompted him to express the need of prayer for more workers in the field.—Jonah 4:11; Matt. 9: 36-38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">' Even though you often meet indifference, and sometimes rebuffs or opposition, do you appreciate that these people are often ignorantly working against their best interests? Do you maintain your good spirit, knowing that you are looking for sheeplike ones and that Jehovah will ‘open wide the hearts of such ones to pay attention’ to the good news you bring, just as he opened the heart of Lydia of Philippi? —Acts 16:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If you have the proper motive and spirit, people will see it or sense it, and it will attract persons with right hearts. Even some who oppose will ‘soften’ in heart as you are observed sincerely and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col. 2) </span><span class="font10">have been saved and never occupied during an entire session. People were forced to stand or go to a place where they could not see or even hear well, thereby missing that whole portion of the program. If we are saving two or three seats and the session has begun, our Christian conscience should move us to relinquish any seats we are saving, unless they are for volunteer workers who will occupy them shortly after the session starts or for someone who has gone out to a washroom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Especially the older brothers and sisters, or handicapped ones, should be helped. In some circumstances a younger person may want to give his seat to an older one. Christian love on the part of both young and old will work toward the enjoyment of the assembly by everyone. Many fine points on our conduct in such matters are discussed in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> of June 15, 1970, under the heading “Showing Love for One Another at Assemblies.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The assemblies will be loaded with spiritual refreshment, and we want you to enjoy them thoroughly and benefit fully from them. Complete your plans now for attending all four days!</span></p></li></ul>

Now, what will you be doing with this extra time? Really, this is a marvelous opportunity to show how much you appreciate the truth. It is something to think about, for how many summers are left before the “great tribulation” strikes? Not -many. So why not use some of the extra time in a way that shows God how deeply you appreciate his truth? There is opportunity to do more personal Bible study and to share more fully in the field service. Could you vacation pioneer during at least part of the vacation period?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> How thankful we are that we have found the truth! Do you feel like Andrew, who exclaimed to his brother Peter, “We have found the Messiah,” and led him to Jesus? (John 1:41) Do you feel as do “the twenty-four elders” who say to Jehovah, ‘We thank you because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king’? (Rev. 11:16, 17) Then you will want to tell out the truth to all who will hear.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Do the people on whom you call know that you represent a Bible society? There might be times when it would be beneficial to mention it. It could provide you with a fine opportunity to give an additional witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This month, for example, we are offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font10">and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> book for $1.25. So, this is really a Bible month. But suppose the householder, for some reason, is not interested in this offer but still indicates an interest in the Bible, possibly even one of the older translations. Why not mention that we might have what he wants? We have the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">King 'James Version</span><span class="font10"> for $1.00 per copy and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font10"> for $1.50. We also provide the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Interlinear Translation</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font10"> at $2.00 each, either of which can be of great help to one who wishes to examine more closely the Christian Greek Scriptures in the original language. Then, not to be overlooked is the excellent large-print </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New</span><span class="font10"> World </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Translation</span><span class="font10"> for $5.00.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If we keep t hese thoughts in mind it will provide an opportunity to render a service that undoubtedly will he appreciated. Also a further discussion might result when delivery is made. If a person wants a Bible, no matter what version he prefers, it is an indication of interest in God’s Word of truth. Thus an opening is presented for cultivating that interest in the right direction, helping the person really to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">understand</span><span class="font10"> the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In some instances you might find it appropriate to mention that we have the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding.</span><span class="font10"> In this case you could take along your own copy on return visits and Bible studies, showing the interested ones the helpful features of this book. As mentioned in the March </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> it would be good for congregations to have one copy of each of these large volumes, the large-print Bible and the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding,</span><span class="font10"> on their bookshelves, even though these books are cash items. There is no reason to carry more than one or two copies, depending on the size of the congregation and the rate of placement. If someone gets an order, delivery can be made the following week by getting the copy that is on hand at the literature counter. Then the literature servant can order another one to replace it. In that way the Bible student would not have to wait so long for the new publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> While we have different literature offers during the year, we can keep alert to what householders and interested persons say and in what they indicate an interest. Then we can mention these different Bibles and study aids as the occasion suggests. Let the people know that you represent a Bible society and that you want to help them in any way you can to get acquainted with the “sayings of everlasting life.&quot; —John G: 68.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Baptized brothers who read well should be selected to read at the &quot;Watchtower&quot; study. They should also be good examples of Christian living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Practice and experience in developing reading ability should first be gained privately and at the Theocratic Ministry School. The elders of the congregation, observing how brothers handle their assignments in the school, can determine when they read well enough to be added to the list of readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since approximately one-half of the time allotted for the meeting is occupied by reading the paragraphs, care should be exercised by the reader to see that the audience gets the maximum benefit from the reading. The reader should appreciate his opportunity thus to share in serving spiritual food to the brothers. He should express warmth and enthusiasm, to encourage heartfelt motivation in applying the counsel in &quot;The Watchtower.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the reader to fulfill his assignment &quot;whole-souled as to Jehovah&quot; he must prepare carefully in advance. (Col. 3:23) He should go over the material several times, getting the sense of It so as to impart the right sense and meaning to the audience. Underlining certain words to be stressed or marking for pauses may help. Also, pronunciation is important. One should not guess or be overconfident, but look up in a dictionary every word of which he is not sure. &quot;Aid to Bible Understanding&quot; will provide pronunciation of many proper names. Wrong pronunciation of words not only detracts from understanding, but may also cause others to mispronounce words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To be assigned to read at the &quot;Watchtower&quot; study is an expression of confidence on the part of Jehovah _ and the congregation. Those enjoying' this fine privilege should use the occasion to &quot;adorn the teaching of our Savior, God,&quot; by reading clearly and with good volume, doing all they can to impart full understanding of the instruction received through the &quot;faithful and discreet slave.&quot;—Titus 2:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>

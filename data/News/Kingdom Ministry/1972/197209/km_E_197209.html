<p><span class="font10">September is a month when significant changes will be taking place in the congregations, and you are privileged to have a share in these. It is recommended that the entire body of elders meet together early in September; And we suggest that before that meeting each of you study carefully Chapter 4 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font10"> book, on “Shepherds of the Flock of God,” so as to have clearly in mind what needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you have not already done so, at this meeting you will decide who is to conduct the various congregation book studies for the year to come, and assignments of duties should be worked out for the ministerial servants. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-'otcer,</span><span class="font10"> January 1, 1972, pages A 26.) Lists also need to be drawn</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of brothers who -may be used to read paragraphs at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">study and of those who could serve well as chairmen at public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the special responsibilities of elders is teaching, and much of this is done in congregation meetings. Discuss what can be done to improve the meetings locally. You need to plan together your public meetings, deciding what subjects will be covered in the months ahead and who will give the talks. Decide, too, which instruction talks you brothers will deliver at the ministry school, and what matters need special attention on the service meetings. Brothers, never lose sight of the fact that your aiding all in the congregation to benefit fully from the “food” provided on the “table of Jehovah” is a key factor in their spiritual growth and health. Accomplishing this also requires personal attention to members of the &quot;flock,” so at your meeting take time to discuss any situations needing attention and decide who of the elders can care for these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In harmony with what was said at the district assembles, the preaching of the good news and the making of disciples should be vigorously promoted in every congregation. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Promoting Respect for the Divine Name</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Isn't it wonderful to have the truth, to be favored with the privilege of knowing Jehovah and blessed with the responsibility of declaring his name throughout all the earth? Could there be anything more satisfying, more worth while? —Ps. 148: 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During September, we are featuring the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book in our field ministry. Why? Many people wonder where man came from, why wickedness is permitted and how much longer it will be before a real change is brought about. In giving the answers, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font10">book promotes respect for Jehovah as the Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Schoolchildren returning to class, parents interested in protecting their young ones against the Goddishonoring evolution doctrine, yes, each of us, old and young alike, can promote respect for Jehovah’s name by making good use of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* Additionally, you may find it advantageous to have with you others of the 25c publications as you share in the field ministry during September. Feel free to offer any field overseer and the Bible study overseer bear special responsibility in this regard, but all who are elders are keenly interested in it. We encourage you to discuss it together, to make definite plans and to aid the congregation to appreciate fully the grand privilege that is theirs to be public witnesses of Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The September field service report for the congregation will be the first one submitted to the Society by the new presiding overseer, and he should be sure to have It in the mail no later than October 6. This year the outgoing presiding overseer does not need to send in a comprehensive report on the condition of the congregation and the work it of them when jou realize that they could help a certain householder. Or, if you prefer to present the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book you may do that. All these publications promote respect for Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another way in which each one of us can promote respect for the divine name is by our conduct. When one does not curse, steal, engage in immoral sexual practices, is not hateful or oppressive in his dealings with others, such a one is different, isn’t he? Just think of the respect promoted for Jehovah’s name by our everyday manner of living as Christian witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> Further, since Jehovah is a clean, orderly God, one who is wholesome and pure in every respect, he encourages us to be the same. (2 Cor. 7:1) In this regard, have you stopped to look at your Kingdom Hall lately? Is It clean? Does it need repair? Do we treat this property with respect, with concern? We should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> And what about our homes and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 7, col.</span><span class="font10"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">has done during the past year, but that will be done next September. However, it would be appreciated if, without delay, the congregations would put into operation the new arrangement for handling applications for temporary pioneer service, doing this locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a grand privilege to serve under the direction of Jesus Christ, the appointed Head of the congregation, sharing with him in promoting respect for the divine name and in providing loving care for all the “flock of God.” May Jehovah bless you richly as you freely give of yourselves in doing so.—1 Pet. 5:1, 2; 1 Thess. 2 :8.</span></p>

(Very brief introduction: If we are to love Jehovah with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength, we need to control every fiber of our being. We need to keep the motivations of our heart in check, control our thinking faculties and direct our strength and activity in a way that is beneficial. We need self-control to serve Jehovah whole-souled and continue to have his approval and blessing.) (1) What is self-control? (&quot;Aid,” p. 1468) (2) How have we benefited from Jehovah’s exercise of self-control toward mankind? (Jer. 18:7-10; 2 Pet. 3:9) (3) How can Jesus’ example of self-control encourage us in the event we are dealt with unjustly at work or in school? Also, what circumstances that arise in field service call for self-control? (1 Pet. 2:21-23) (4) When situations arise in the home that cause us to become irritated, why should our way of handling matters be completely different from that of worldlings? (Develop with examples.) (Gal. 5:22, 23; 2 Tim. 3:1-7) (5) Why would a parent’s loss of self-control w’hen correcting a child diminish the value of the discipline? (Eph. 6:4; Heb. 12: 9-11) (6) As imperfect humans, what must we do in order to keep our sinful inclinations under control? (1 Cor. 9:25-27; 2 Pet. 1:5-8) (7) Why is it especially vital that overseers or elders have self-control? (Titus 1:8-11; 2 Tim. 2:23-26) (8) How does the case of King David illustrate that a long record of faithful service to Jehovah is not enough to maintain self-control? (2 Sam. 11:2-4) (9) W’hen would it be advisable for a man or a woman to marry, and why? (1 Cor. 7:9, 32-38) (10) How can one keep passionate desires in check when one is too young to get married? (Rom. 12:12; Phil. 4: 8, 9) End with encouragement to cultivate self-control in every aspect of our lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">(6 min.) One of elders reasons with audience on value of teen-age articles. How many parents have actually discussed them with their teen-age sons and daughters? How many articles have been discussed —three, four or more? (No need to get show of hands; just raise these questions.) Have had twelve articles now. When will * they discuss the remaining ones? (Why not resolve in your heart right now when you can do this?) The information is most vital. Some of it may be hazy in the mind of young person if discussed many months ago. It is good to review this information from time to time. Need to go over often to compete with pressures exerted daily by old system through schoolmates, neighbors, etc. One youngster said regarding these articles: &quot;Although I understood what was said in these articles, my appreciation for them was enhanced greatly when my parents sat down and discussed them with me.” Could review some of the main thoughts in these articles during the past year and show how timely and encouraging the information is. Select what is most appropriate for young folks locally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">(12 min.) Audience discussion on following points based on &quot;Organization” book, pp. 126, 127: (1) When are reports to he turned in? (2) What should be reported relative to hours in field service? (For example, witnessing done during the noon hour at place of secular employment, witnessing to relatives, to neighbors, etc. Show that it Is not a matter of our keeping track of these things so as to get &quot;credit” for them, but it is simply that the Society would very much appreciate having a full report.) (3) What may be reported as return visits? (Include such things as the writing of letters to give a witness, making phone calls to give a witness or to make an appointment for a Bible study or to take a newly interested one to a congregation meeting, delivering a magazine, etc.) (4) What magazine placements may be reported? (In addition to those distributed on the street, from house to house, etc., encourage the brothers to include back issues that are given away free, perhaps being left in the door when someone is not at home. At the present time some of our brothers seem to have the idea that it is not right to count some of these things, but it would be appreciated if they would include them all so that our reports will be complete.) (5) How and when are Bible studies to be counted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">End this discussion by making the following points: Reports, when submitted, provide encouragement for all of us because they help us to see that prophecy is being fulfilled, that the good news is being preached and that the &quot;other sheep” are being gathered. 15 min: Presentation for &quot;Awake!” campaign.</span></p>

Things are happening so fast in the world today, a person hardly knows what to think, isn’t that true? [Pause to allow for householder’s reply.] Would you like to see better conditions? [Comment briefly on world and/or local conditions.] The Bible foretold these very conditions. [Paraphrase Luke 21:10 and Ila; you may also consider verse 26a, if you wish.] But what does it all mean? Note Jesus’ words at Luke 21:28. [Read.] The Bible shows that some would scoff at Jesus’ statement, but note the warning recorded at 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3.

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Advance Insight from</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE &quot;PARADISE-THEOCRACY&quot; BOOK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">Think back to what you studied in the Theocratic Ministry School during June and July. Do you remember reading and hearing talks on the books of Haggai and Zechariah? Beneficial as that was, it did not answer all our questions about those two Bible books, did it? What a delight it was, then, to receive at the “Divine Rulership” assembly the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Ue-stored to Mankind—By Theocracy!</span><span class="font11"> And before the convention concluded we had our urgent question answered, ‘When will we begin studying the new book?’ In December!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But who of us would not benefit from some advance knowledge of its contents as well as insight into how the message in Haggai and Zechariah involves us? Well, we are soon going to be able to gain such advance knowledge and insight, for a special series of seven public talks is planned based on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise—Theocracy </span><span class="font11">book. Working progressively through the book, the talks will give us a rapid coverage of its contents. This will benefit both us and newly interested ones who attend our meetings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>You Can Contribute</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">These talks will be given at the Kingdom Hall by the ciders in the congregation, where possible, or by elders invited from nearby congregations, if this can be arranged. Even though you may not be an elder, you, too, can personally make a valuable contribution to the overall success of this special program. How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For one thing, as soon as the exact dates for the series in your congregation are announced, you can begin inviting those with whom you are studying and other interested pei-sons. Encourage them not to miss any of the fine material. This is one contribution you can make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another contribution involves your preparation. Each talk will cover a few chapters of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise—Theocracy</span><span class="font11"> book, as well as corresponding chapters of Haggai or Zechariah. If at all possible, during the week prior to the meeting read the Bible chapters involved. And, as time pennits, also read the corresponding chapters in the new book (which you should bring to the talks). This will greatly increase the benefits that the talks bring to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Each week as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">chairman</span><span class="font11"> announces the „ title of the talk for the following week, it would be beneficial for him to state which Bible chapters are to be covered and which chapters in the new book are involved. That will remind us to make our contribution by preparation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>When Are the Talks Scheduled?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">We are all intensely interested in the new material. And we will begin using the new book in the congregation book studies starting in December. Hence, it will be best to have the talks as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some congregations will be able to arrange these seven talks for October and November. That is fine. We encourage you to do so. But if publie talks are already lined up for October, and it seems best to the elders to follow through with those arrangements, then we recommend that these special talks be scheduled for November and December. If the congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer or a circuit assembly during that period, the seven talks may be scheduled around such events. In that way the congregation will still benefit fully from all these provisions. When the details have been worked out locally, handbills may be ordered and an announcement should be made to tell the congregation when to expect the talks.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Arranging for Speakers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Even though we are providing some suggestions as to developing and presenting the material, it will require time and effort to work up the talks. If the local congregation has a sufficient number of elders, this may present no problem, no one being overburdened. But what if that is not the case?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, if the local elders desire to do so, they may contact nearby congregations. Perhaps two or three congregations can work out arrangements to share speakers, and, of course, speakers sent to other congregations should all be elders. For example: The brother who has the first talk in the series delivers it in Congregation A. The next week he gives it in Congregation B (where the talks are scheduled a week later than in Congregation A), and the third week in Congregation C. The brother who prepares the second talk gives it the succeeding weeks to each of the three congregations in order. And so on. Consequently, a brother may not have to prepare more than one of these talks, and more than one congregation will benefit from his preparation. Also, in this way each congregation will hear the talks in their proper sequence.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Preparing the Talks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">As you will see from the following outlines, each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, from two to four chapters of the book. Hence, if you deliver one of the talks you simply cannot cover all the excellent points in the assigned portion of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise—Theocracy</span><span class="font11"> book. Nor will you be able to read and explain every verse in the portion of the Bible that your talk considers. It is necessary to be selective if the audience is going to get the overall view as well as the thrust or application of your talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The outlines will help. When you know which talk you are to give, read over the outline to fix in mind the direction that it should take. Next read the portion of the Bible that you will be covering, and then consider carefully the assigned chapters of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You will observe that we focus attention on selected paragraphs and texts. The surrounding material in the book will help you to get the setting. But in your talk we encourage you to deal with just the paragraphs highlighted in the outline. The scriptures cited in the outline are meant to be read. Keep in mind the theme. This will be a challenge, but to the extent that you succeed, the audience will benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a couple of eases we refer the speaker to a paragraph outside the chapters of the book he is assigned. This is so a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font11"> comment on the historical situation being dealt with in Haggai and Zechariah can be made. But such ought to be very limited, as other talks in the series deal more extensively with this. It is brought in merely so you can give the background or setting of the material you will present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Occasionally you may want to call attention to a particular paragraph in the book. Perhaps you will even arrange for a qualified person in the audience to read a portion of the book or some Bible verses. In addition, give thought to whether use of a blackboard or a few review questions at some appropriate point in your talk will help the audience to fix the information in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers in the congregation will be looking forward to your talk. By your careful and thoughtful preparation it will prove to be, we feel certain, a real blessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">1. Paradise Restored—How? (pm chapters 1-3; Hag. 1:1-15)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">We have valid reason to hope for restoration of paradise.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 1; 15 min.) Desirability of paradise is undeniable; is a basic idea behind concern about ecology and pollution. Is not a mere idle dream. One valid reason for such a hope is that Jesus confirmed that an earthly paradise once existed. (Pars. 4-7, 11) Proves the accuracy of Genesis 2:7-10, 14. (Read from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font10"> or par. 12.) Involved same general area where Jews were later in exile. (Par. 13) Jesus also promised restoration of paradise. (Pars. 16, 17; explain how he “will be with” evildoer.) Hope valid, too, because paradise is God's purpose. (Pars. 21-23) Though he did away with first paradise after humans lost right to be in it, God gave prophetic illustration of his ability to produce paradise conditions again. (Par. 31; Isa. 35:1, 2, 5-7, 10) History thus proves his blessing is the prime factor, not human technology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Example of Jetcs who returned from exile shows । that enjoyment of paradise is dependent on putting true worship first.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 2; 20 min.) God's blessing is needed, for he controls even weather. Must give due attention to true worship to gain his blessing. See this with Jews who returned. (Pars. 3-6) They left off work on temple they had returned to rebuild. (Hag. 1:1, 2; pars. 15-19) Instead, were attending to their own material interests. But rather than prospering and enjoying paradisaic conditions, they came into want. (Hag. 1:3-6) Problem was they did not put true worship first; as a result they lacked God’s blessing. (Pars. 24-26) Should be an advisory example for us, who are hoping for restored paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God will definitely restore paradise, for those obeying him as ruler.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 3; 20 min.) God stressed that proper action is required to reverse one’s unblessed condition. (Hag. 1:7; gist of vss. 8-11) Is not easy; it may be contrary to will of someone with authority or influence over you—husband, parents, employer, school officials, government. Jews were in similar situation. (Par. 4) Yet they obeyed God as ruler. (Hag. 1:12-14; pars. 14-17) Same is required of Christians who look to God for restored paradise. We even find a modern-day parallel in spiritual “Israel of God.” (Pars. 20-23) Public witnessing of anointed halted in 1918, as if captive in spiritual Babylon. In 1919 they reoccupied right spiritual estate. (Par. 27) Despite bans on literature, needed to obey God and give spiritual temple first place. They responded, having leadership and service of Greater Zerubbabel and the one foreshadowed by High Priest Joshua. (Pars. 30, 34, 35) We too must-A obey God as ruler and depend on him. Men will not** restore paradise—He will! Our obedient attention to true worship will assure our enjoying that paradise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Nations will be rocked into destruction, yet we can have hope.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 4; 20 min.) Many despair over mankind's future; overlook real reason wicked system will end—God’s disapproval. (Ps. 127:1) What he approves and blesses will remain, as illustrated with Jews. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Briefly: pm</span><span class="font10"> 246, par. 18) Had reason for courage; God was backing. (Hag. 2:4, 5; pars. 8, 9) Would complete and inaugurate that temple. (Hag. 2:6, 7; pars. 12, 13) Was reminder of Mount Sinai and tabernacle. (Gist of Ex. 19:16-19; pars. 18-20) Larger, more serious fulfillment of Haggai 2:6 involves Kingdom and God’s spiritual temple. (Heb. 12:25-28; pars. 27, 33-38) Wicked spiritual heavens shaken after 1914; will yet be destroyed. (Pars. 42-44; Rev. 20:11) Ungodly human society first shaken by being notified. Rocking finally means destruction. (Pars. 45, 46, 48, 50, 52) But we can have hope, for Kingdom and God’s spiritual temple will remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Join now in worshiping at the temple that will remain.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 5; 10 min.) Prior to shaking of nations to destruction, “desirable things” come in. (Hag. 2:7; pars. 4, 5) Fulfills Isaiah 2:2-4; not spiritual Israelites, but “nations.” (Pars. 8, 10, 11) Worship “in his temple.” (Rev. 7:9, 15a) Not in courtyard ' where Israelite priests server!, but Court of Gentiles. (Par. 15) God protects them. (Rev. 7:15b; pars. 16, 17) Zerubbabel’s temple was more glorious than Solomon’s. However, both picture glorious spiritual temple, Most Holy of which is God’s place in heaven. (Hag. 2:9; Heb. 9: 23, 24; pars. 23-26) While a spiritual son on earth Jesus served in Holy of this temple and in courtyard for priests. Resurrected into Most Holy. (Pars. 27, 28) Anointed on earth also serve in Holy and in courtyard for priests. (Par. 30) Both they and “other sheep” enjoy peace now in spiritual temple. (Par. 37) Will survive with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God requires fearless, wholehearted worship.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 6; 10 min.) God also raised up Zechariah to strengthen Jews. (Par. 2) May have been lag in temple building; urged to “return.” Needed to be fearless, wholehearted to gain His full favor. (Zech. 1:3, 4; pars. 9-12) Similar in modern parallel; anointed feared men. (Par. 17) After 1919 fearlessly and wholeheartedly ‘turned’ to work; He ‘returned’ to them with favor. (Pars. 32, 33) All who hope to survive coming “rocking” must render fearless, wholehearted worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Those rendering clean worship are blessed.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 7; 15 min.) A spiritually clean person can become unclean. (Hag. 2:13; pars. 4, 8) One indifferent toward temple could not render clean sacrifices; must do building work. (Pars. 9, 12) Similarly, anointed needed to be cleansed of fear of men and indifference. (Pars. 13, 16) Blessings followed. (Hag. 2:19; pars. 19, 20) Also, when God rocks the nations, His people will be protected. (Gist of Hag. 2:21, 22; pars. 26, 27, 32) Zerubbabel like a seal ring, precious to God; Jesus now precious leader. (Hag. 2:23; pars. 36-39) Rendering clean worship, you will not be shaken with nations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">3. How Jehovah Prospers His People (pm chapters 8-10; Zech. 1:7-3:10)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah prospers his people by showing them mercy. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 8; 20 min.) Prosperity dependent on God's favor. Can reverse one’s condition from poverty to prosperity. God is willing to display mercy, as shown with Jews who returned to build temple. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Briefly: pm</span><span class="font10"> 92, par. 1) Other nations considered Jerusalem no source of concern to them. (Zech. 1: 8-12; pars. 12, 17) But God was no longer displeased; time had come for reconstruction, and nothing would stop it. (Zech. 1:13-17; pars. 25, 27, 28) Nations had abused, persecuted God’s people; he promised mercy. (Pars. 30, 31) In modern times, dealt similarly with anointed ones ruled by Greater Zerubbabel from heavenly Mount Zion. (Par. 33) Were persecuted and as if abandoned, but God has “returned”; shown mercy, so congregations thrive. (Pars. 37-40) Also comforts people with promise to smash persecutors.—Zech. 1:18-21; pars. 42, 46, 48, 50-53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God prospers his people by protecting them-.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 9: 20 min.) Real prosperity is possible only if life and possessions are protected. To be expected that God would protect those who make up his capital organization. (Pars. 5-7, 12, 17) Promised “wall” of protection for spiritual Jerusalem to help his people to grow. (Zech. 2:1-5; pars. 22, 26, 30-33) He is sensitive over his servants. (Zech. 2:8; par. 45) Invites persons of all nations to join with prosperous, protected servants. (Zech. 2:10-12) God safeguarded “holy ground” for exiled Jews; also restored anointed remnant to their land. (Pars. 56-59) Spiritual prosperity proves he is ‘residing’ with them. People of nations have joined with spiritual Israelites; having hope of earthly life.—Pars. 61-65.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God helps his people to keep clean, so they enjoy prosperity.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 10; 15 min.) Logically expect opposition and obstacles to spiritual prosperity. Satan is opposed, as he was to Joshua’s efforts regarding temple. (Zech. 3:1, 2; pars. 6, 7) Joshua typified Jesus. (Pars. 2-4) Uncleanness in God’s sight is an obstacle to prosperity. Joshua “unclean” in that people he represented had neglected temple work. (Zech. 3:3, 4; pars. 13, 14) Similar with remnant for a time. (Pars. 15, 17) Clean priesthood portends greater priesthood of “Sprout.” (Zech. 3:8-10; pars. 32-35) “Stone” in place guarantees completed temple; pictures Messiah, who is topstone in Jehovah’s system of worship. (Pars. 36-40, 43) Prosperity to result produces peace now and leads to eternal life.—Par. 45.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Have You Really Sided with the Ruler God Upholds? (pm chapters 11-14; Zech. 4:1-7:14)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">.4 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ruler God supports accomplishes outstanding things.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 11; 15 min.) People oppressed by corrupt ruler often have no power to resist. (Prov. 29:2) God backs a righteous ruler for whole earth. Foreshadowed by his support of Zerubbabel. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Briefly: pm</span><span class="font10"> 240, par. 4) Jews' efforts to rebuild temple under Zerubbabel faced “mountain” of obstacles. But God backed Zerubbabel with spirit to ‘level’ opposition. (Zech. 4:6-9; pars. 10-15) Temple would be completed, headstone added. In modern times, Greater Zerubbabel stimulated work of restoring worship at spiritual temple despite opposition. (Pars. 21-24) God’s spirit (oil) illustratively shown to be vital. (Zech. 4:1-3, 11-14; pars. 31, 32) Zerubbabel and Joshua imbued nation with spirit; Jesus channels it to Christians who recognize him as ruler.—Pars. 34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Siding with God’s chosen ruler requires rejecting wickedness.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 12; 15 min.) Not sufficient to recognize God’s ruler; must also reject wickedness. (Par. 2) Zechariah 5:1-4 shows thieves and false swearers are cursed. Thievery (a form of idolatry) even includes distorting Bible teachings. (Pars. 12-14, 18) Oath-breaking clergy claim to side with God and Jesus, but have broken covenant. We cannot be like them. (Pars. 22-25) Wickedness must be removed from God’s people. (Zech. 5:5-11) Not endured among Jews, but relegated to Babylon. (Pars. 30, 32, 35) God to collect wicked out from his servants. (Pars. 38, 39) We must uphold that view to side truly with him and his chosen ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Divine protection extends to those on earth- siding with God’s ruler.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 13; 15 min.) Have already seen that God upholds Jesus, as He did Zerubbabel, but will that mean protection for humans? Next vision answers. (Zech. 6:1-5) Chariots represent bands of angels who protect God’s people. (Pars. 5, 9) Issue from between kingships of God and Jesus. Since each is a king having rulership, can be portrayed as two kingdoms. (Pars. 6-8) Such protection is available to all siding with God’s ruler. (Gist of Zech. 6: 6, 7; pars. 11,12, 16) Protected ones today will witness grand finish of temple work. Joshua typified Jesus, Priest-King who has carried on temple work since 1919. (Zech. 6:11-13, 15; pars. 22, 23) Increasing numbers come to temple of pure worship. Their estate is protected; will survive coming tribulation. —Pars. 26-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Siding with God’s ruler involves accepting his judgments.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 14; 10 min.) Many feel God’s standards too strict or that executional work at Armageddon is cruel. One siding with God’s ruler will not resist or mourn over his judgments. Jews mourned over expressions of divine judgment. (Gist of Zech. 7:3-6; pars. 4-6) God did not expect that; Jews were really fasting or eating for themselves. Should have left badness and done good. (Zech. 7:7-11) We should not mourn because anointed were disciplined in past nor resist other judgments from God or his ruler. (Par. 13) Siding with ruler involves supporting him to receive in turn his support.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">5. Peace to AU Who Listen to What Jehovah Has Said (pm chapters 15-17; Zech. 8:1-10:12)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">True peace linked with listening to Jehovah.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 15; 20 min.) Politicians </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">say</span><span class="font10"> they will bring peace; those who listen to them are disappointed—no permanent peace. God is only reliable source of peace. (Ps. 29:11) Seen in dealings with .Tews returned from exile. (Par. 4) Listen to what Jehovah has said: Zion to become place of true worship. (Zech. 8:3; par. 6) People to have peace. God has done similarly for anointed since restoration. (Zech. 8:4, 5; pars. 8-10) Not too difficult for God. (Zech. 8:6; par. 12) However, reversal of condition surprises observers. (Zech. 8:11-13; pars. 21, 22) Maintaining peace involves proper conduct. (Zech. 8:16, 17) Ask: ‘Do I listen to what God has said on such matters, and act accordingly?’ Today people of many nations desire peace; listen to Jehovah and join with spiritual Jews. (Zech. 8:20-23; pars. 34-39, 44) But what happens to those who do not listen to what God says?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Make your choice—peace or war.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 16; 20 min.) In ancient example, God foretold calamity for Syria, Phoenicia. (Gist of Zech. 9:1-5; pars. 5, 6, 8-10) Philistia condemned, but a remnant chose peace with God. (Zech. 9:6-8; pars. 14-17) Today some have also left bloodlusting gods and chosen peace and protection as true worshipers. (Pars. 19-22) Zechariah 9: 9, 10, regarding peace, fulfilled in Jesus. (Pars. 25, 28) Brings peace to God’s people: war to opposers. (Par. 29) Anointed, not Christendom, have chosen him as King. (Pars. 30-33) Peace is assured anointed, for God defends them. (Zech. 9:15; pars. 46, 47) He is their tender, peaceful shepherd.—Zech. 9:16, 17; pars. 48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Those who listen to Jehovah enjoy further blessings. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 17; 15 min.) In contrast to calamity of those opposing God, Jews were blessed with life-giving rain, (Zech. 10:1; pars. 4-6) Likewise, God has given anointed increased spiritual blessings. (Par. 7) Such are not for persons following worldly ‘'shepherds.” (Zech. 10:3; pars. 11-14) Anciently, exiles from all twelve tribes were reunited in their land. (Zech. 10:6, 7; pars. 19-21) Similarly, anointed, older and newer parts, blessed with unity. (Pars. 23, 24) Regathered worshipers “become many” with his blessing, (Zech. 10:8; pars. 31, 33-35) Listening to what Jehovah has said, they have overcome all obstacles. (Zech. 10:12; par. 40) All must continue listening and obeying to enjoy peace.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">6. How Much Does God’s Shepherd Mean to You? (pm chapters 18-20; Zech. 11:1-13:9)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Vital that we appreciate Jehovah's chosen shepherd. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 18; 20 min.) Humans sorely need reliable leader or shepherd who will treat them properly. Most persons lack appreciation for God's shepherd. Rulers aptly likened to shepherds. (Pars. 1, 8) Ancient “shepherds” mistreated people over whom God was Great Shepherd. (Zech. 11:4, 5; pars. 10, 11) Similarly, clergy have treated as “flock meant for the killing” people who look to them. (Pars. 12-15) God used Zechariah as shepherd; pictured Jesus. (Zech. 11:7, 8; pars. 20, 21, 28-31) Jesus dismissed three classes improperly shepherding people. (Pars. 32, 33) Most persons undervalued Jesus as shepherd. (Zech. 11:12, 13; pars. 37-44, 48) Christendom, professing love for Jesus, actually rejects him; persecutes his servants, refuses their message. (Par. 50) Test for us: Do we value more highly Jesus and his kingdom, or promises and guidance of human leaders? Vital to decide now.—Zech. 11:15-17; pars. 51, 54-56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Lack of appreciation for Jesus leads to annihilation. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 19; 20 min.) Further proof that Christendom does not appreciate shepherd (Jesus) portrayed in next chapter. Spiritual Jerusalem is object of attack. (Zech. 12:1-4; pars. 3-6) After Kingdom established, spiritual Judeans came under siege, but attackers got 'scratched.' (Pars. 10-13) Though anointed seem “open” for attack, attackers will be annihilated. (Zech. 12:7, 9; pars. 19-22) Those attacked and preserved deeply appreciate Jesus. (Zech. 12:10; pars. 30-32) They know he is shepherd of God’s people; determined to look to and follow him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s shephe.rd helps to cleanse God’s people. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 20; 15 min.) Should have intense love for Jesus. His sacrifice makes possible our cleansing from sin; represented by “well” in Zechariah 13:1. Showed a need for divine provision for cleansing. (Pars. 4-8) Anointed restored in 1919, cleansed. (Pars. 11-13) Shepherd did not abandon them. Early disciples “scattered&quot; but protected; similar with modern anointed. (Zech. 13: 7; pars. 29-33) Those not faithful to God and his shepherd cut off when temple inspected. Imitation “weed” Christians and “evil slave” cut off from spiritual estate of God’s people; minority preserved. (Zech. 13:8, 9; pars. 34, 39-45) Faithful continue to look to God, approaching tlirough ransomer Jesus. &quot;Great crowd,” too, await time when shepherd leads them to human perfection and eternal life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">7. Theocracy’s Triumph Ushers In Paradise (pm chapters 21, 22; Zech. 14:1-21)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s rulership will triumph over defiant nations.</span><span class="font10"> (Chap. 21; 30 min.) Witnesses have long ■ preached coming war between God and nations; not imagination, but based on Bible. With evidence of “last days” mounting, interested in details of that war. Involves attack on representatives of heavenly Jerusalem. (Zech. 14:2a, 3; pars. 3, 4) Nations “became wrathful,” persecuting remnant; actually warring against Kingdom. (Rev. 11:15, 18; pars, 11-15, 18) Final attack yet to come. (Par. 20) There is a provision for protection. Jehovah and Jesus are both kings; their kingdoms likened to two parts of mountain that splits, offering protection. (Zech. 14:3-5; pars. 23-34) Will be darkness and cold for defiant nations, but light for one upholding theocracy. (Zech. 14: 6, 7; pars. 35-38) “Living waters” provided for “great crowd” and dead. (Zech. 14:8; pars. 42-45) God known earth wide. (Zech. 14:9; pars. 52, 53) Defiant abusers of God’s name wiped out; whether “scourge&quot; literal or not, their end is sure. (Zech. 14:12, 13; pars. 57-60) Thus theocracy triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A paradise for those rejoicing in true worship. </span><span class="font10">(Chap. 22; 25 min.) Elimination of defiant nations opens way for paradise. Jesus indicated evildoer would get this by resurrection. (Luke 23 : 43; pars. 3, 4) Survivors will work to restore paradise, though spiritual paradise takes precedence. (Pars. 5, 6) Resurrected will have to take up true worship: cannot be indifferent. (Zech. 14:16-19; pars. 7, 10, 11) Festival of Mosaic law not celebrated, but people will rejoice in Jesus’ sacrifice and Kingdom provisions. (Pars. 14-16) All things will serve to praise of God. (Zech. 14: 20, 21; pars. 18-21) Ones continuing in paradise will not be interested in commercial profit, but in true worship. (Pars. 25, 26) Seventh creative day closes with earth a paradise; all worship the Theocrat.—Par. 29.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As faithful witnesses for Jehovah, we want to have as full a share as possible In preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and making disciples of those who respond favorably to his Word. It is also our desire that our everyday conduct will testify to the good results that come from applying Bible principles. Our weekly service meetings greatly assist us to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- The presiding overseer is responsible for the service meeting, lie should be keenly interested in making it as upbuilding and instructive as possible. He may personally want to take oversight of these meetings each week, making assignments of the various parts and offering suggestions on how to adapt them to local needs, or he may at times share that responsibility with other elders. In any event, it is his responsibility to be sure that the service meetings are properly prepared and presented to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Elders and ministerial servants are requested to take charge of individual meeting parts. The presiding overseer does not always have to handle the concluding portion: at times he may open the meeting or he may care for a meaty Scriptural discussion in the middle of the meeting. All who are assigned to present material should give careful thought, not merely to coverage, but also to teaching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah's people are unique in their resolve to stand firm for divine rulership. During July this was shown not only by the tine attendance at the district assemblies, but also by our public ministry in behalf of Jehovah’s kingdom rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been four years since the &quot;Truth&quot; book was first published. In spite of its wide distribution throughout our territories, during July we placed 682,596 books, well over 100,600 more than during the same period last year. Truly Jehovah is richly blessing the work of his servants! </span><span class="font10">to the one handling the part. In this way, each portion of the meeting will be helpful and instructive no matter what the local conditions may be. The body of elders may be aware of a certain situation that needs consideration and this can be given attention when convenient.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregation accounts should be audited soon after September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now that elders will be the only speakers sent out to other congregations, the elders of nearby congregations may find it beneficial to check with one another to find out which talks have already been prepared by someone, and they may want to coordinate their assigning of new talks. In this way the best use can be made of each talk that is prepared, thus saving much time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ New publications available:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!&quot; God’s Kingdom Rules! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">—Italian</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ A supply of forms is being sent to Ine congregations. When more are needed they may be requested with literature orders. A new form. Theocratic Ministry School Assignment Slip, is now available at 80c a thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ In cities where there are more than one congregation (formerly units) these will continue to use the congregation number already designated for their use, such as, UI. U5, etc. In filling out forms, the full name of the congregation and the congregation number should always be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">new subscriptions obtained during October, congregations will remit $1.40. This is also the amount that congregation publishers will turn in to the brother who handles the subscriptions. What about the cost of the book? If publishers show their subscription slip to the one caring for literature supplies, he will give them free one of the books regularly-placed for 50c—any one that Is in stock. Pioneers will continue to remit 75c for new subscriptions, and during October the same arrangement for replacing books that are given as premiums will apply to them as applies to congregation publishers. Then at the end of the month, the congregation may request full credit from the Society for all these books given free with new subscriptions, and the account will be credited at the regular congregation rate. On the Remittance and Credit Request form, a separate entry should be made, reading: “Books given free with subscriptions,” and then the total number should be shown; this total will include all books given for this purpose to congregation publishers as well as pioneers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> How wonderful it Is that Jehovah has allowed us lowly persons of the earth to honor and promote respect for his name!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With Patience and Perseverance</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever been discouraged after several hours in the house-to-house work or in making return visits because you found very few persons at home or talked to only a few individuals? Do you feel as if you have not accomplished much if you place only a few magazines or tracts in an entire morning? Really, we should not be discouraged. Why? If we have been faithful and have persevered in doing Jehovah’s will, he is pleased with our service. Further, we cannot completely control our placements or ensure that people will be at home when we call. But to a large degree we can control the time and effort we put forth in Kingdom activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah is directing his work and it is his will that people everywhere be given the opportunity to hear the good news. Indeed, the time left in which to reach people in our territory with this good news is short. As we preach, persons may watch us but not talk to us. Others may not open the door, but they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Is $1.50 Too Much?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> For over a year now the subscription rate for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> has been $1.50 for either magazine for a full year. How do you feel about that price? Do you hesitate to offer subscriptions, feeling $1.50 is too much?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Look at it from the standpoint of the householder. Most homes have certain publications that they receive on a subscription basis. Do you know what they are accustomed to paying for them? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly</span><span class="font10"> magazines that many persons have coming into their homes have subscription rates of $4.97, $7.50, $8.50 and $10.50. Popular </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">weekly</span><span class="font10"> news magazines that are received in many homes have subscription rates of $10.00, $12.00 and $14.00 per year. So when you ask $1.50 for a year’s subscription for an excellent magazine that is published twice a month, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the price is extremely low.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But there is something more to consider. Do you know' of any magazine in the world that contains information more important to the householder than what is found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake !f </span><span class="font10">realize who is calling and sometimes are favorably impressed with our faith and devotion. However, even if the householder is not interested, are we not giving a witness? Indeed we are.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps, because of physical limitations, your field activity may be restricted to street work, letter writing or informal witnessing. Do not think for a moment that your work is in vain. (1 Cor. 15:58) Often favorable commepts are heard by others going from door to door because of your good conduct and your fine works. Solomon stated: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> How vital it is, then, to be patient and persevere in doing Jehovah’s will. The main thing today is to be totally involved in doing that will, totally committed to Jehovah’s righteous cause.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">There is none. Why? Because these two magazines are the only ones that direct their readers to the only Source of salvation and to His kingdom as the only true hope for mankind. Because they draw their message from the Bible, what they contain is literally lifesaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Since this is true, is $1.50 too much to ask? Many persons are Jehovah’s Christian witnesses today because of the fine information published in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> It got them started on the way to eternal life, and it has helped them to stay on that way. Certainly such ones do not feel that $1.50 is too much to ask, do they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> Subscriptions can do things that a single piece of literature may not. They are persistent in their efforts to help; again and again the magazines come, trying first in one way and then in another to stimulate interest in learning about Jehovah and his purposes. With sincere interest in the lasting welfare of those to whom we preach, we can help them to benefit from this loving service by enthusiastically encouraging them to subscribe.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font9">• When are we to start having prayer before our public meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If your congregation has not yet begun to do so, this week is a good time to start. Since we look to Jehovah as our Instructor for his blessing and guidance, it is appropriate for our meetings to be opened and closed with prayer. (Isa. 54:13; John 6:45) This is true whether the meetings are attended only by regular members of the congregation or are ones to which the public has specially been invited. If two meetings are held, one after the other, then prayer is offered at the beginning and end of the entire program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A capable brother, generally one of the elders or ministerial servants, should be assigned in advance to be chairman at the public meeting. After he warmly welcomes those in attendance, he will invite the congregation to join in a song of praise to Jehovah, and then he will usually offer the opening prayer. Following this,, the chairman should inform the audience of the title of the talk to be given and introduce the speaker. His remarks ought to be very brief. After the talk, the chairman may make whatever announcements are appropriate for those present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the material at our public meetings is explained in terms that the public can grasp, it is not directed solely to newly Interested ones. The information is also highly informative and upbuilding to the members of the congregation who are regular attend-ers. It is fitting that all of us, whether baptized Witnesses or persons newly interested, turn our hearts to Jehovah in prayer on such occasions, for truly he is our “Grand Instructor.” —Isa. 30:20.</span></p>

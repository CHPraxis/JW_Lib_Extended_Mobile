<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘Dean, ^fellow</span><span class="font15"> ^PuMiskits:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Here at Bethel we seem to be busier than ever. The backlog of books on order is about 16 million! To help us meet the demand, we have been temporarily running three bindery lines at night. Really, an average month’s work here is tremendous : We make about 2 million books, and print about 20 million magazines. Each month </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Aivake!</span><span class="font12"> are presently produced here in 61 separate magazines, in a total of 30 languages. So there is much to do at Bethel, and it is all a very necessary part of the work in preaching “this good news of the kingdom.” Of course, to get all this great amount of work done, people are needed. Are you in position to help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because of the kind of work that is done here, there are certain requirements that must be met by applicants. Those invited are healthy young men and women between the ages of 19 and 40. Also healthy married couples over 25 years of age, married more than three years, may apply. They should be without any obligations or responsibilities at present toward family members. All applicants for Bethel service must agree to stay at Bethel for at least four years. But, better still, why not make Bethel service your career, your life’s work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All who apply should like to do hard work, because that is what we do at Bethel. We have a vast amount of work to be done at the Bethel home, factory, office and Watchtower Farm. Young men and women willing to work hard and devote themselves full time to serving Jehovah at Bethel should write to the Office of the President and ask for an application for Bethel service. But before you write, please read pages 145-147 of the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization for Kingdom-preaching and Disciple-making,</span><span class="font12"> under the subheading “Bethel Service.” Make this a matter of prayer. If you filed an application </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font12"> the “Divine Rulership” Assembly and still want to</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> She was just a little girl, but she spoke so boldly! Were not our hearts moved by the young Israelite girl in the drama this summer whose faith in Jehovah caused her to speak courageously to her imposing master Naaman? Tactfully, kindly but with conviction she told him of Jehovah’s powers and his ability to save those who put their trust in him. To her, Jehovah wa’s the only God, and she knew that everyone should come to him.—2 Ki. 5:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s dedicated people, do we feel the same way she did? Will we speak boldly about Him too ? Will we make His name known to our friends, relatives and those who live in the community around us? This is indeed a time to speak boldly, a time to let the people know they are living in the concluding days of this system of things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We have a tremendous help in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine. As an instrument of truth it speaks boldly on the issues of the day. When you read this no doubt you will already have made use of the October 8 issue, which shows straightforwardly that lasting peace will come only from Jehovah through his kingdom come, please request a new application. It may be that you will be invited to come soon to work at Bethel, “the house of God.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">As befits a family loyally adhering to the theocratic rule, the members of the Bethel family do their work because they love Jehovah God. It is a family that has one interest in mind, and that is making known the name of Jehovah and announcing his kingdom. What joy they have in performing this labor of love in behalf of their fellow workers and all mankind! We hope that more of you can share our joy, especially by making Bethel your life career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brothers, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">arrangement. You will find that the October 22 issue in its opening article asks, “Does modern man need God?,” and then presents material that answers with a most positive YES I As its companion we will b6 offering the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> which features the stirring-talk delivered at the assembly, “Divine Rulership—The Only Hope of All Mankind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We believe you will agree that it is not difficult to place </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Of course, the more we know about a subject the easier it is to speak about it with confidence; so it is good to get to know what is in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and then, with specific talking points in mind, go in the field service and present the subscription offer. A year’s subscription is inexpensive, only $1.50 for 24 issues, and we are giving free with each new one-year subscription a fifty-cent book (copyrighted before 1961). Just think, $1.50 is less than what many persons pay for one meal, and yet subscribers get a year’s supply of spiritual information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When is the time to speak to others about these things? Just about any time. If it is a matter of organized field service activity, then the weekends seem to be the best time for those who do secular work during the week. Would it be possible to spend more time in the field service on Saturday or Sunday? Why not examine your schedule and see if you can spend more time in the house-to-house work, or in some other feature of preaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Is it necessary for you as a housewife to be home much of the time because of children or other responsibilities? If so, you may still find occasions during the week to be in the field service, there to offer subscriptions. Even if you are at home you may still be able to preach the good news and take subscriptions. True, it takes courage to</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Song 90. Introduction. Two elders discuss text and “Question Box” with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Speak Boldly!” Cover by question-and-answer method. Give brothers opportunity to relate local experiences of speaking boldly in the field service from door to door or informally at home, school or work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Accounts report. Also, cover appropriate points on turning m subscriptions so all understand how they may cooperate, making sure that each slip is made out neatly, accurately and in triplicate (two copies turned in, one of which is to be marked “copy”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Serving Jehovah Whole-Souled.” Discuss by questions- and answers the material in the “Organization” book, Chapter 7, page 132 to page 134, paragraph 3. Have the scriptures looked up to the extent possible and read each paragraph. Emphasize that motivation to serve Jehovah comes from the heart and that each one should endeavor to express appreciation to Jehovah to the fullest extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: Concluding comments. Also have brothers prepared with talking points from October 15 “Watchtower” and October 22 “Awake!” Encourage weekend activity with special magazines, with emphasis on subscription offer. If talks on “Paradise—Theocracy” book have started, encourage all to attend. Song 101. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Song 24. Introduction. Elder discusses text, then Branch Letter, with a group that could be eligible for Bethel service. Discuss importance of work done at Bethel in relation to the entire organization. Talk about routine of life at Bethel, type of work done. Consider motive in applying for Bethel service: not just to get away from home, or to see New York, or to be looked up to by others, but out of love for Jehovah and his people and with willingness to serve in any assignment to advance the Kingdom interests. Read excerpts about how those at Bethel feel about serving there. (w70 59, 60; wG6 639; g69 11/22 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk by brother on “‘I’m Not Interested’—Why?” based on article in August 8 “Awake!” Show why knowing how people think and reason helps us to overcome this objection. May also wish to include thoughts on overcoming objections to, ‘I already subscribe to a number of magazines.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Jehovah—A Name to Respect. Talk and audience discussion. Base this on material in “Aid to Bible Understanding” under subject, “Jehovah,” page 885, paragraph 3, “Importance of the Name,” to page 889, paragraph 3. One handling this part should not deal with just technicalities and figures. Make this part one providing faith-building information and practical material for the field ministry. For example, one could show how to answer questions that might come up, such as ‘Why worship Jehovah when many say he is the tribal God of the Jews?’ or, ‘Why do you use the name Jehovah?’ or, ‘How does one get to know Jehovah?’ If the material lends itself to answering a question often encountered locally, then such a question and answer should be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Concluding comments. Include experiences by publishers in placing the special issues of magazines and in obtaining subscriptions, also build up enthusiasm for the public talks on the book “Paradise Restored to Mankind—By Theocracy!” Song 44. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(Plan this meeting yourself. Might wish to prepare for this by asking brothers to submit beforehand questions or situations that they would like to have dealt with to improve their understanding of the Scriptures or to carry on their field ministry more effectively. The presiding overseer or, at his request, another elder can decide what questions to use and the manner in which the information will be presented. If sufficient questions are not brought up by the publishers, undoubtedly the elders will have thoughts as to what material could best be considered for the spiritual welfare of the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 19. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Suggested sermon for November—“Paradise Restored by Theocracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min) Chairman talks with audience: First time to use new book “Paradise Restored to Mankind—By Theocracy!” in door-to-door work. We are getting to know book through public talks and reading it, so now can offer in field ministry with enthusiasm. May wish to use following Scriptural presentation or another one that is best for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min) Chairman discusses with audience development of presentation. After appropriate introduction to householder one might say: “People everywhere are interested in good government. Would you be interested in knowing what the Bible says the future holds as regards rulership here and all over the earth?” (Allow for comment.) Answering according to householder’s reply, you may wish to say, “If you are familiar with the Bible account, you know that God put man in a paradise but that man was later expelled from that paradise because of disobedience. However, did you know that God promises to restore paradise by a government of his own? [Here again, allow for reply.] In the last book, Revelation, He says He will bring to ruin those ruining the earth. (Rev. 11:18) And we read at Revelation 21:3 and 4 that . . . [Read.] So it is by God’s rule, a theocracy, not man’s rule, that paradise will be restored. This publication ‘Paradise Restored to Mankind—By Theocracy!’ describes how this will come about. It discusses in detail the Bible books of Haggai and Zechariah. It is yours for a contribution of 50 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min) Encourage brothers to practice presentation at home so as to present new book effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: “Presenting the Good News —Helping One Another.” Handle with questions and answers, but include demonstration of what can be done at meetings for field service to help prepare publishers for day’s service. May want to use Scriptural presentation discussed in previous part or presentation of magazines. Make clear that if publishers want to go directly into field service after meetings on Sunday without having a separate meeting for field service later, such can be done. See June 1967 “Kingdom Ministry,” page 4, and July 1968 “Kingdom Ministry,” page 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: Jehovah—Our Unchanging God. Upbuilding talk based on material in “Aid to Bible Understanding,” page 892, paragraph 5, to page 894, paragraph 3. Emphasize God’s unchangeable interest in his people despite their imperfection and why we should serve him zealously out of love and not out of compulsion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Urge all to support public talks on new book. Encourage turning in all subscriptions promptly. Song 50. Prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 73. Text comments and pertinent Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: “Let the Young Children Come.” This could be handled by questions and answers, also allowing time for discussing with younger brothers and sisters in congregation what they are doing to spread the good news among their schoolmates and upbuilding one another at school and at other opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font10"> min: Discussion of Theocratic News items. Use this part to build up interest in whole association of brothers world wide. Let the congregation know what was accomplished in the field ministry in October. Mention also talk on new book, encouraging all to attend and to bring interested persons with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">30 min: Your Relationship with God. Cover material in “Organization” book, page 13 to middle of page 18. Read each paragraph. Emphasize in this the disowning of ourselves by the giving of ourselves to Jehovah to do his will as an individual. Show the importance of the field ministry as a means of expressing our appreciation for approved relationship with God. Song 72. Prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1972 443,182 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN AUGUST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Excellent! As a result of your zealous activity, a new peak in books placed was reached in August—972,612 copies. That is the highest number of books that Jehovah’s people have ever placed in any one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just think what that means as far as spreading the teaching of Jesus is concerned, as most of those books were likely “Learning from the Great Teacher.” We will want to encourage parents who have this fine teaching aid to use it regularly to teach their children the principles of truth and righteousness. It can be the means of protecting them against the moral decay of this system of things and guiding their minds and hearts in the doing of Jehovah’s will in the future, for their eternal welfare.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Let the Young Children Come&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Let the young children come” was the way Jesus expressed his feelings about young people of his day who were brought to him by their parents. He spoke, too, of the humble, trusting attitude displayed by young children as an example of the attitude that must be shown by those to whom the kingdom of God would belong.—Mark 10:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> And, “come” you have, progressively learning and applying the things you have learned until today there are hundreds of thousands of you young people who are devotedly serving Jehovah. But did you progress to your present position on Jehovah’s side all by yourselves? No, for many of you it was likely because you have loving parents who have been teaching you God’s commands at home from infancy. Your education has continued at the Kingdom Hall, and those of you who have made the most rapid progress are the ones who have participated as fully as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> You have marvelous opportunities to teach others and to make disciples at school. By example and by word you can help others your own age to see that the attitude of the “now generation” is only a further expression of the selfish spirit of this world and that the “real life” is in doing God’s will. (1 Tim. 6:19) Do you recall reading in the June 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower,</span><span class="font12"> page 381, of the two young sisters in the United Arab Republic who by their conduct set such a fine example that ten other youngsters came to be interested in studying? Does your own conduct compare favorably with that of these young sisters?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We recently heard, too, of an eleven-year-old brother who was at home when a woman called there by mistake. After giving the stranger' correct directions to her destination, the brother mentioned that it was good she came when she did as he was about to leave for his friend’s home to study the Bible with him. The woman wanted to know more. He was happy to explain and placed a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book with her so that she, too, might study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Have you thought, too, of the effect that your appearance and conduct have on others when you call at their homes to witness to them? A few months ago a letter came to the office from a man in California who said, “This is to let you know how proud I was of the two young men that called at my door on Sunday . . . They were well schooled and very neat in their appearance.” How good it was that these young Christian ministers took the time to be sure that their appearance was befitting the message they were bearing! Can you imagine what his reaction might have been if these young brothers had come </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12"> the door looking and behaving like those among the youth of today who are rebellious?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Adult publishers are often glad to have you young ministers along with them in the field ministry. Sometimes people will not open their doors to a man alone or to two men, but will be inclined to open the door and listen when a younger publisher is along. Your parents, after teaching you a presentation that you can give, are delighted to stand beside you as you tell others of the hope within you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Another way you can accept Jesus’ invitation to draw closer to him is to take advantage of upbuilding others in the faith. For example, in the school you attend there may be other young brothers and sisters. Why not associate closely with them and talk to them about the things you are learning from God’s Word? In one school the brothers and sisters of various ages eat their lunch together and discuss the day’s text or the articles for youth that have appeared in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The (Continued on page 8, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Speak Boldly! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">speak up when tradesmen come to the door, but the conversation may include world conditions and here is your opportunity to offer a subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Or, you may find, as some publishers do, that you can telephone those you have not been able to find at home at other times. Be determined to speak; let others know God’s truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Have you tried the store-to-store or street work recently? Boldness is needed here. As people walk along the street or stand waiting for a bus, you can strike up a brief conversation, offering them the magazines. It has been observed in a number of cities that publishers working together miss many opportunities to present the magazines because of conversing with each other or merely standing with the magazines without speaking. On the other hand, we know of an elderly sister who placed many magazines and subscriptions on the street. When asked how she did it, she said that when people asked the cost she would say, “It’s just $1.50 for a year.” Then if they did not take the subscription she offered the single issues. Perhaps you could try this yourself.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">determined in our efforts to preach the good news to others, we can still be kind, tactful and pleasant. We want to reach the hearts of those to whom we speak. We have the most wonderful message to deliver and we should always speak with conviction, recognizing that our source of strength is Jehovah. Let us, like the apostles, pray that Jehovah may grant that we “keep speaking . . . with all boldness.”—Acts 4:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping One Another</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>T</sup>As an “association of brothers” we all want to help one another. (1 Pet. 2:17) This is especially true in connection with the grand work we have been assigned as Kingdom-preachers and disciplemakers. It is very impressive to see the wonderful work that this “association of brothers” has accomplished in bringing the good news to others, spending in the United States over 71 million hours in the field service just last year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When we consider that many who share in this work are quite young and others are newly associated, with 47,953 being baptized last year in this country, we can see the need to help one another to be effective in our service. But even those who have been a long time in Kingdom service very much appreciate the help and suggestions received from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font12">and the assistance given by the older brothers in showing effective ways to present the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Often it is noted that fine presentations are reviewed for us during the service meeting. But by the time we are ready to share in the field service, those thoughts may have already slipped our mind. What can be done where additional meetings for field service are arranged? In addition to considering the text briefly, it is usually beneficial to discuss suggestions on a presentation we can use in the field. If the group will be offering magazines, would it not be good to discuss a few interesting points from the current magazines that might be mentioned to householders?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Or, if you will be presenting the regular offer, the discussion might be handled in a variety of ways as it appears best to the brother caring for the group. For example, if a new sermon has been suggested in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> it is helpful to review this with the group. Some might feel it of benefit from time to time to ask different publishers to give presentations to the group. On other occasions perhaps just the Scripture texts might be reviewed or talking points from the literature to be presented. Perhaps some have had good results using a certain presentation, and their comments would be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> For variety, a brief consideration of some of the factors that make our ministry a success could be highlighted. For instance, can we make our introduction more interesting or appealing, catching the interest of householders? Do we make it a point to try to draw them into the conversation, helping them to understand? Do we make the main point we want to convey stand out? Do we try to illustrate the point in a practical way? Do we show enthusiasm and friendliness in our approach? Is our conclusion effective? Do we give them reason to desire what we are offering?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By our following these suggestions, when the brothers leave the meeting for field service they will feel prepared to say something specific and thought-provoking. On the other hand, if the person in charge of the group just remarks, ‘I’m sure we all know the offer and a presentation,’ some may feel they are not helped by gathering together as they might have been.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Finally, who does not appreciate a warm invitation to work along with another publisher, especially if he is young or rather new in the service? So let us at all times consider helping one another.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">“Let the Young Children Come” (</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Cont’d) Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Their noontime discussion periods have been a protection for them both physically and spiritually. Could you do this at your school?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> As you grow older, what will you do with your life? Are you planning to engage in the pioneer service when out of school? Have you thought of serving at Bethel or in the missionary service? You will experience great joy and have endless privileges if you prepare now for such full-time service and reach your goal in the future. Even if circumstances are such that you cannot pioneer, there is plenty to do in your congregation and you may work to qualify in time as a ministerial servant and, later, as an elder. We are glad that you have accepted Jesus’ invitation to “come,” and we encourage you to serve whole-souled.—Matt. 22: 37.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ Despite problems in Ireland between Catholics and Protestants, Jehovah's witnesses were able to hold an assembly with 1,385 in attendance, there being 26 immersed. The 1,055 brothers continue to maintain integrity and neutrality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Japan reports their 60th consecutive peak of publishers in July (14,161), [which means peaks each month for five years in a row.] Four district assemblies there attended by 21,921, with 931 baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">♦ New peak of 88,351 publishers in Nigeria for July. Good progress being made on Bethel extension construction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Austria reports 2,000 more books placed than same month last year and almost twice as many temporary pioneers. Attendance for district assembly in Vienna reached 31,363 and 733 were baptized. Sessions held in German, Greek, Turkish and Serbo-Croatian.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The 106 publishers on Guam happy at peak district assembly attendance (302). Delegates came from Marshall Islands, Truk, Saipan, Palau and Yap.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question. (Sox</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• What is meant by “some years ago” on page 170, paragraph two, in the “Organization” book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This indicates more than a year or two. It may be noted that it did not say “many years ago.” So it is not an exact number of years, but more like two or three years. It was not intended to have a brother go back into the distant past to bring up wrongs of which he repented years ago and that have evidently been forgiven by Jehovah and are not being practiced now. In many cases the wrongs occurred prior to the time when the “Watchtower” drew attention to what the Scriptures say on such misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If a brother has been serving faithfully for some years and has seen evidence of Jehovah’s blessings upon him, why should he now step down from office? If he has the right viewpoint now on conduct and will give good counsel he should be able to continue to serve. If the local body of elders see that he has the respect of the congregation and has shown the proper qualifications over the last two or three years, he may remain in his position of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Must wrongdoing be brought to public attention after many years? The book (page 168) under “Public Reproof” quotes 1 Timothy 5:20 and mentions reproof of those who confess to committing more than one offense. But it really has to do with recent events. The “Interlinear” refers to those “sinning,” something going on at the time. So if repentance occurred some years ago, three years ago or more, and sinning ceased, and he is respected by the congregation, it is not necessary now to publicly reprove one who committed more than one offense “some years ago.”</span></p>

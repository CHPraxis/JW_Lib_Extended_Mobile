<p><span class="font12">We thought you would like to know what fine work you did during the 1972 service year in the forty-eight States. Total publishers increased by 15,346, which means we had, on the average each month, 418,239 persons declaring the good news. Isn't that tine! The ratio of publishers to population is now 1 to 476, Of course, States vary considerably. The ratio ranges from 1 to 271 in Oregon to 1 to 972 in Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are 118 more congregations than last year, bringing the total to 5,794. Tliis is wonderful, especially when we compare it with the number of congregations twenty years ago—3,103. Yes, 2,691 more! And a tremendous amount of literature was placed. Including books, booklets and magazines, this past year you placed 98,135,514 pieces of literature. That represents about two pieces of literature for every family in the country! Besides that we shipped to you over 29,000,000 Bible study folders. -And the handbills printed for your use reached a total of 122,236,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A great amount of effort was put forth to reach the people with the most urgent message of the day. Total hours in the field service came to 71,912,301. Return visits totaled 34,032,676. Home Bible studies averaged 298,129 monthly. Pioneers reached a peak of 15,565. Total applications for temporary pioneering came to 64,205. What were the results? A grand witness was given concerning the name and kingdom of our God; also, during the year 47,953 persons were baptized as disciples of Jesus Christ, to compare with 22,023 ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our meetings are well attended. Considering the number of publishers, attendance is running about 100 percent or higher for all five meetings. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study now averages nearly 115 percent. Also each week about 22 circuit assemblies are held. How does Sunday attendance at these assemblies compare with the total publishers in the circuit? It is about</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Show Appreciation for Your Freedom</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus assured that “the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32) We have experienced this, and how thankful we are that it is true. No longer do Babylonish teachings and traditions hold us captive. Nor are we in slavish fear of men or their organizations. Showing good balance, we are careful that we do not use our freedom as a cloak for moral badness. Rather, as Jehovah’s name people, we are glad to serve as slaves of God and desire to be directed by Jehovah’s holy spirit. —1 Pet. 2:16; 2 Cor. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We were all thrilled this summer to receive so much spiritual direction at our district assemblies and to receive the new publications, including the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradis^ Restored to Mankind—By Theocracy'! </span><span class="font12">Many of you have read this new book by now and others have 65 percent more than the number of publishers! Many persons are interested in learning the truth, as also reflected in the attendance of 703,695 at the public talks at the sixty district assemblies this past summer, and in the Memorial attendance of 976,233!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Truly this is no time to slow down—no more so than was the final day that the Israelites marched around Jericho a time to slow down. They went around the city seven times on the one day! Love for Jehovah should move us to use every occasion to magnify his name, to continue to preach as long as Jehovah affords US opportunity. Concern for our fellowman should move us to exert ourselves vigorously to search out and aid everyone who has love for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">11)73 Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> there are thrilling reports about the work that is being done. The book’s introduction gives a fascinating coverage of highlights of the work from all parts of the earth. Then been alerted to many of the high points by the special talks. We can see that God’s spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God, and it is by that spirit's operating on his “faithful and discreet slave” that we come to appreciate the writings of the Bible prophets. (1 Cor. 2:10) How much we appreciate both our freedom and that we are such a spiritually well-fed people in the midst of a spiritually famine-stricken world I</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> But are these truths for us to enjoy alone? Are we to keep them to ourselves and not share them with others? No, we are not selfish. Il is our desire to share this information from the Word of God with any who will hear and receive It. Isn't that the way you feel?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">•' 1 hiring November we will be </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 7, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font12"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">there are extended reports on Brazil, the British Isles, Ghana, Guatemala ami Japan all of them a delight to read. It is thrilling and heartwarming to see how Jehovah has blessed his people as they have reached out into all the inhabited earth, to make known the good news. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> will give you insight into the tremendous amount of work that has been done and the fearlessness with which our brothers have spoken up in behalf of the truth. By mid-November the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> should be ready for shipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Again, we encourage you to share copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> with your relatives, neighbors and all who are having Bible studies. If they read it and are of honest heart, surely they will be moved to say, ‘God is really among you people!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is a pleasure to be serving with you as, together, we keep on exercising our freedom from the &quot;authority of the darkness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Insert on Bible study activity, pars. 1-10. Several brothers discuss material. Encourage any publishers who are seeking a Bible study to inform the Bible study overseer, also if anyone knows of a good prospect for a study and is not able to care for it, inform him of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: “Presenting the Good News —In All of Your Territory.” Brief question-and-answer coverage of material. Include report on territory needing attention in local congregation, where it is located, how many territories are involved. Encourage publishers to take out this territory and work it.

<p><span class="font9">13 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate items from “Announcements.” “How Is It Handled?” can be considered. Encourage family groups to share in the field service together during “holiday” weekend. Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Song 65. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “The Organization That Jehovah Is Using.” Questions and answers on “Organization” book, Chapter 2. Give attention particularly to pages 7-10, rather than trying to rush through all the material. Encourage brothers to give Scriptural basis for their answers. (Read paragraphs 1-4 and the last paragraph on page 12.) Par. 1. By what power did Jesus say the work of preaching and disciplemaking would be carried on and succeed? Par. 2. What is to be noted about the disciples when the holy spirit was poured out at Pentecost 33 C.E.? and about the congregations as the preaching of the good news spread? Par. 3. How did our brothers in the first century show that they recognized the congregation is God’s? To whom do Jehovah’s witnesses look as their Supreme Ruler? Par. 4. Whom do we recognize as the Head of the congregation? Pars. 5-10. What is the purpose of the congregation? Who make up the “faithful and discreet slave” class today, and over what have they been appointed? (Matt. 24:47) Pars. 11-14. How can we show respect for the earthly organization that Jehovah is using?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Offer the “New World Translation” and the “Word of God” book. Family discussion of work for December and of territory needing attention in the congregation. See the article “The Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What will help the publishers in your congregation the most in their hQuse-to-house work during December? Will some need help in making an effective presentation that is brief during the holiday season? Do the brothers need suggestions on points of interest to which they can direct the householder in the Bible or “Word of God” book when presenting it? What can they say if tne householder indicates he already has a Bible? It is suggested that just one of these points, or possibly two, which will be most helpful to the congregation, be discussed and developed by the family handling this part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Are You Following Up the Interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (2 min.) We find interested ones when we are in the house-to-house work. The Society, other publishers, friends or neighbors may tell us of someone who has shown interest. At your secular work, when shopping, at school, as well as other times, someone may make a comrfient that indicates a good heart condition. Make note of all who show interest. Make return visits and do what you can to help them to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publishers may make return visits by delivering magazines, or other literature, by conducting a study, writing a letter, calling the interested person on the telephone. Or, it may be just a friendly discussion in an effort to further stimulate the person’s Interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When making return visits, some publishers find it difficult to get the conversation going and hold the householder’s interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Audience discussion: (10 min.) Ask congregation what subjects they find are of interest to people in the territory and are effective for discussion on return visits. It may be wise to expand on the subject discussed on the first call. Or, on the initial call, you may have observed that a particular subject w<sup>T</sup>as of special interest to the householder. (Invite publishers to express themselves freely. This is an opportunity for them to exchange ideas.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Also, ask publishers how they introduce themselves and begin the conversation on return visits in order to both catch and hold the interest of the people. Some have found that being just warm and friendly, showing a personal interest in the householder and his family, will accomplish the most. It may be the subject you introduce for consideration that will attract and hold attention. Some publishers make effective use of questions to catch and stimulate Interest. (Entertain as many suggestions from the publishers as time will allow.) Encourage the brothers to use the good suggestions given as they follow up the interest they find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Concluding comments. (8 mln.) Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 3 10 min: Song 20. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “What Is the Christian View of Dancing?” Family discussion of article in September 15, 1972, “Watchtower.” It is suggested that the family head read appropriate paragraphs from the article, Inviting both questions and comments from family members after the paragraph or portion of it is read. Endeavor to help family members to appreciate the reasons for what is printed, why it is correct and the Scriptural principles involved. Consider the paragraphs that you believe will be most appropriate to the needs of the congregation.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What a pleasure it is, not only to direct others to God’s Word for the truth that will set them free, but also to be the one who can place in their hands, at their doorsteps, a copy of the Bible at very small cost. Jehovah has again made it possible for us to concentrate on this work for a full month, December, when the offer will be the -Veto </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation</span><span class="font12"> and the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of Godf, </span><span class="font12">for $1.25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Since the article “A Bible Society” was published in the June </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> which reminded us that the Society publishes a number of different translations of the Bible, we have noticed that quite a number of congregations have had to order some of these various translations. Apparently, many publishers have kept in mind the suggestion made—that if the householder shows an interest in the Bible but wants another translation, we should not hesitate to explain what we have to offer, namely, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font12"> for $1.00, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Interlinear Translation </span><span class="font12">and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font12"> at $2.00 each, and the excellent large-print </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> for $5.00. Now, of course, we also have Byington’s translation for $6.00. And, for those who read another language, we have the complete </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font12">in Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, as well as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> in French.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our appreciation for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> prompts us to encourage people to take this version. However, we are glad to be accommodating and fill requests for other versions in harmony with the interest shown. This could be another step in developing the interest and helping someone on the road to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Hello! you had a question?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the October </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> provided information about Bethel service, you may have been wondering, ‘What is Bethel like, and what does one do there?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To answer the first part of that question, ‘What is Bethel like?’ you could read page 254 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose</span><span class="font12"> and get some idea. Briefly, the part of Brooklyn that looks toward the towering buildings of lower Manhattan as well as New York Bay and that is known as Brooklyn Heights is where the Watchtower Society has its headquarters. Here are a number of large buildings. Two of them, known to Bethelites as “124” and “107,” accommodate around 500 persons each, and several others nearby take care of 200 to 250 persons. In addition to excellent living quarters we have many other very fine facilities. For example, a large modern Kingdom Hall, four dining rooms seating a total of about 1,500 persons, libraries, reception rooms, our own laundry, pressing shop, shoe repair shop; and there are a dentist, a doctor and several nurses to care for health needs. Bethel is a big home filled with dedicated servants of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the next question, ‘What does one do there?’ Living at Bethel enhances the spiritual lives of those who are members of the Bethel family. We do not live by bread alone but by every word proceeding from God’s mouth. Our daily spiritual program is most upbuilding. The members of the family have specially assigned seats in the different dining rooms of the home, and the family meets together at 7 a.m. We have a fine discussion of the day’s text. Members of the family participate, and the brothers serving on the governing body take week-long turns in summing up the day’s comments. For new members of the family we have an excellent eight-month provision. This includes eight special lectures. Then there are twenty-six weeks of Monday-evening classroom sessions along with twenty-six Wednesday-evening lectures. The classroom sessions are divided into two sections: (1) Shepherding the Flock of God and (2) Teachings That Mold Our Lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Additionally, all members of the family are assigned to one of the 218 congregations in New York city. We have the same service privileges as any other congregation publisher. This includes field service, home Bible studies and sharing in the congregation meetings, being an elder or ministerial servant if the local congregation makes such a recommendation to the governing body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Living with so many brothers and sisters is quite different from living in a little home with a father, a mother and a brother or a sister. It is a big family with lots of brothers and sisters, and everyone is tremendously busy here, each one having his assigned work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We came to Bethel to serve Jehovah and to aid our brothers world wide by producing literature for their use in the ministry. All of us appreciate the good things that come from the Watch Tower headquarters in the way of Bibles, books, magazines, tracts, letters and, every month, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> These are printed not only in English but also in many other languages. Of course, you would not be receiving these publications at such a reasonable cost if the printing were done by some commercial firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Having the Bethel home and printing plants that have been built over a period of sixty years makes it possible for the Bethel family not only to handle matters dealing with office correspondence but also to do printing work. They operate linotype machines, make printing plates, operate printing presses, work in the book bindery and do other things connected with making up the printed page. Others do carpenter work, machine-shop work, painting and so forth. It is part of a tremendous operation for producing literature that supplies Jehovah’s witnesses world wide with what they need for their ministry. No other organization on earth can put out publications as we do, such as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book, at a cost of 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We here at Bethel consider it a great privilege to be able to make literature at such a low cost and send it all over the world in so many languages. It is truly an honor to be a member of the Bethel family. But, while it is an honor, it involves a lot of hard work too, for which those who fully appreciate their privileges of service willingly give of their time and energies. The apostle Paul worked hard too, traveling to many parts of the earth in his evangelizing work. Jesus worked hard. Our brothers in the missionary field spend long hours and work hard in the ministry. Congregation publishers and pioneers everywhere throughout the earth are very busy with the preaching activity. They are all working hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But Bethel work is somewhat different in that, to a great extent, it is manual work from 8: 00 in the morning until 5: 40 in the evening, with an hour</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">off at noon for dinner. We appreciate that when we eame to Bethel we came to do what we were assigned to do and to learn whatever the Lord’s organization wanted to teach us in regard to printing the Word of God. Because of its importance, our work at Bethel takes priority over all other activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is hard work, and that is why we invite young people, either single persons or married couples who are healthy, strong and who have no obligations, to be part of the Bethel family. Our letter in last month’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> pointed out what the requirements are. When a person comes, we hope he will stay at least four years. But for many it ean become a career. Many members of the family have done that, and there are brothers and sisters at Bethel who have been here for thirty, forty, fifty or more years. They are still working each day and enjoying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Much depends on how one looks at life. Do you want to live in a little home by yourself, husband, wife and children? Or as a young man do you want to stay at home with the rest of the family, have your own car and go and come as you please f Or, would you like to give yourself wholeheartedly to Jehovah’s service and spend your life doing things for other people? That is what the members of the Bethel family do. They are working for many others, not for themselves or just those there locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some people may say to you that they have been at Bethel and that the work was monotonous. Usually anything one dbes can become monotonous when one does not like doing it any longer. The farmer enjoys his work even though some persons could say that his work is monotonous. He plants and harvests, and he does it all his life. Terribly monotonous? But you do like to eat, don’t you? Look at what members of the Bethel family are doing. Some are cooks, housekeepers, office workers; others make books and others ship them out. But think of it: We are reaping the blessing of seeing a great ingathering as people read and study God’s Word together with the aid of the publications. Hundreds of thousands of new ones are associating with Jehovah’s organization. Would you call that monotonous ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bethel is a fine place in which to serve. The brothers here often write letters commenting on how they have enjoyed their service privileges as members of this family. One young brother recently wrote: “It is perhaps the greatest privilege of service available to young ones. I feel like this is the best place to serve Jehovah in this time we live in. Had my decision of marriage not come up, I would without a doubt have remained at Bethel for quite a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A young man who wishes to get married after four years in Bethel service is often faced w’ith the same problem about which this brother wrote. But how grateful the individual was for the training received at the “house of God”! Many brothers, after serving four years, return to the pioneer work with their wives, and others go into the missionary work after receiving training at Gilead School. Others become fine overseers in congregations. Often married couples who have previously had experience in Bethel service are called in again when they apply. Many have made Bethel their career as single persons too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bethel is a wonderful place in which to serve the interests of the Kingdom. Looking at it from every angle in life, one sees what a blessing it is. One does not have to cope with certain anxieties in life that others have to overcome. Because we throw our burdens on Jehovah, he in turn cares for our needs. We work with our brothers and sisters day in and day out. We know that what we are doing is a praise and honor to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Serving together unitedly all the time is like being at a convention. You might say that attending a convention every day would be monotonous. But we doubt very much that Jesus found it monotonous preaching every day with the twelve to people who gathered around them. It was Jesus’ life’s work. That is the way we feel about it at Bethel; it is our life’s work, and we welcome you to consider applying for Bethel. If you think about Bethel from the point of its being a career, making it your life’s work, then you indeed can gain untold blessings ami satisfaction in giving of your youth in the service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We feel that Bethel is, as it were, the crossroads of the world, for reports and experiences come in from all parts of the earth, many of which are related to the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We hope this has given you some insight into what Bethel is like and what we do here. In brief, a person works hard and serves his brothers and others. Maybe you would like to share with us in this grand work. We have Bethel homes in Toronto, Canada; London, England; Wiesbaden, Germany; Japan; the Philippines; Australia; South Africa and elsewhere throughout the world as well as in Brooklyn. Applicants must be residents of the country where the Bethel is located, so please do not ask to be sent to another country. After you pray to Jehovah about this matter, it may be you will say: ‘Here I am. Use me!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Think about your career and what you want it to be. If it turns out to be Bethel service, write the Office of the President or any branch office and get an application. Volunteer for Bethel service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Keep busy in Jehovah’s work. Buy out the time. Use it wisely, for the days are wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With you in preaching and teaching the good news,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">IF YOU are a dedicated, baptized disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ, then you have a commandment to share in making disciples. That commandment has not been given to you by a man or an organization of men. You have received it from One who “has become better than the angels” and who has “inherited a name more excellent than theirs.” (Heb. 1:4) This One is the Lord Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:18-20) His name is “more excellent” than that of the angels because it stands for the vast executive authority he has as Jehovah’s appointed King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truly it is a privilege for you to share in the work entrusted to you by One who has such authority. Are you sharing in it? Could you share in it to a greater extent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The primary way in which people today are being assisted to become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ is through weekly home Bible studies. During the 1972 service year 298,129 Bible studies, on the average, were conducted each month in the United States. It is indeed encouraging to know that tens, yes, hundreds of thousands are being assisted in this way to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. Nevertheless, the question arises, Could more Bible studies be conducted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The indications are that more people could be assisted through home Bible studies. In the United States over 360,000 more books were placed with interested persons in the 1972 service year than in the 1971 service year. It is not unusual for people to write to the Watch Tower Society, or to go to a Kingdom Hall or to phone Jehovah’s witnesses, requesting that someone study the Bible with them. Brothers and sisters offering magazines on the street have also been approached with such requests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Many </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Still ‘Sighing and Crying'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are yet many who are sighing and crying because of the detestable things being committed in Christendom and the rest of this ungodly system. Hence the more time you personally spend in searching for such honest-hearted people the greater will be the likelihood of your finding some of them. Do you feel impelled to spend as much time as possible in the preaching work because of your deep concern that no honest-hearted person in the territory be neglected or overlooked? Is your concern such that you put forth every reasonable effort to make return visits where people manifest interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Considering that lives are at stake, we should be moved to set aside as much time as possible to search for sheeplike ones. While the Christian ministry includes earing for one’s family and home, our discharging these responsibilities does not relieve us of the obligation to share in Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making outside our immediate family circle. Our fine example in Christian conduct can give a witness, but that example alone will not be enough for others to become disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. The disciple-making work calls for teaching and, before such teaching begins, persons who are willing to be taught must be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Balanced View of Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This points up the need to care for responsibilities in a balanced way. A fine example to keep in mind in this regard is Noah. As husband and father he had to see that his family had ample spiritual and material provisions. He had to arrange his routine of life in such a way as to have time to build the ark and preach to his contemporaries. The adjustments that Noah had to make were not limited to just a few years. Likely his work of preaching and building spanned a period of forty or fifty years. Despite Noah’s faithful efforts, not one person, aside from seven members of his family, put himself in line for surviving the Flood. But Noah did not give way to discouragement and stop building and preaching due to the unresponsiveness of his contemporaries. How glad we can be that he did not do so! Had he quit, none of us would be alive today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While you may keenly appreciate the importance of imitating Noah’s example in caring for all your responsibilities, you may feel that you are not capable of conducting a home Bible study. Inexperience and limited ability, however, need not discourage you as to your sharing in the work that Jesus Christ commanded his disciples to do. Had Jesus, as Head of the Christian congregation, wanted only those with the greatest knowledge and ability to share in making disciples, he would have said so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That it is not so much a matter of ability as of desire and sincere effort is well illustrated in the case of many new missionaries serving in foreign fields. Their vocabulary is limited. Their speech is often hesitant and clumsy. Their comprehension of the language is far from complete. Yet they are able to conduct home Bible studies. Surely, then, you do not need to hold back because of feeling that others can express themselves better. Besides, more experienced brothers or sisters will be glad to accompany you and render assistance should the need arise. Also, the Bible study overseer will be glad to help you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since Jesus’ command to make disciples is in complete harmony with his Father’s will, you also</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">have the backing of Jehovah and the help of his holy spirit. So if you start a Bible study, you do not have to fear that you will fail because of your limitations. If you look to Jehovah and do your best, he will not allow you to fail in teaching the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Matter of Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If you are not now conducting a Bible study, have you made this a matter of prayer? One brother in Austria did this. For more than a month he repeatedly prayed that Jehovah might help him to find someone with whom a Bible study could be started. Not only did this brother pray, but he also took three days off from his secular work during the circuit overseer’s visit. It was while calling at the last door one morning during the visit of the circuit overseer that this brother started a study with a man and his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A missionary in El Salvador found that many of her Bible students were not progressing. She earnestly prayed that she might find someone who would appreciate life in God’s new order. Later she contacted a secretary in an office. This woman eagerly accepted the magazines and gave the missionary her home address. A Bible study was started with this woman, and her husband eventually also took part. Now a congregation book study is held in their home, and the man, his wife and their five children regularly attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to praying to Jehovah to direct you to those of honest heart, be sure to act in full harmony with your prayers by never overlooking opportunities to start Bible studies. Have you tried offering to study the Bible with people on the initial call? Are there any people on whom you have called in the past that might agree to a Bible study now? Why not cheek your records and make a special effort to visit those who have shown interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are times that the potential for new Bible studies is right within the congregation. In one congregation in the state of Oregon, for example, an overseer made it a point to offer to study the Bible with unbelieving husbands of publishers who had moved into the territory. Within ten minutes of meeting this overseer, one unbelieving husband agreed to have a Bible study. In the case of another husband, a relative, efforts to befriend him led to his accepting a Bible study when another brother called at his home. The two husbands are now baptized and, according to the most recent information, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">more than forty</span><span class="font12"> of their relatives are now either studying or have themselves become dedicated, baptized witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">People who are now studying with us or on whom we have made return visits can also be instrumental in helping us to find other interested persons. Have yen ever asked whether they knew anyone who they felt might want to study the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informal Witnessing Helps</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There may be brothers and sisters in your congregation that are unable to follow through on all their promising calls or are not in a position to conduct more home Bible studies. You might i approach the Bible study overseer and express your desire to help out in this regard. You can be sure that your assistance will be very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Informal witnessing at work or at school has often brought fine results. Are you making good use of sueh opportunities to start studies with your fellow workers or schoolmates? Often seizing the opportunity to give a witness can lead to fine results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A brother working at an auto repair shop in Norway uses all opportunities to talk to fellow workers. At lunch hours the workers discuss various questions, and the brother is often asked to express his views. One of the workers once mentioned that he was impressed with the brother’s always being able to give plain and logical answers. The brother then gave him some magazines. This led to a home Bible study. Eventually the worker became a baptized Witness, later changed his place of employment and there, through informal witnessing, helped two other families to accept the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At school a young lad in Puerto Rico was asked to read a certain portion of a book that dealt with prehistoric ages. He then asked for permission to speak to the class and gave a fine explanation of the Bible’s teachings, using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book as the basis for his comments. The teacher and the students were impressed, and eighteen books were placed that day. The next day the teacher asked the young Witness to continue his discussion before the class. Six more books were placed. Now he is conducting two Bible studies with fellow classmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A teen-age Witness placed an </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book with one of her schoolmates and at the same time offered a Bible study. The girl did not accept this offer. Later, after the girl had read the book, she and the sister got together one evening to discuss the Bible. Several times during the discussion the girl exclaimed: “That is a nice Bible you have.” After three hours, during which the girl had repeated this statement about the Bible three times, the young sister, quite surprised at the remarks, offered her a Bible study. At this the girl exclaimed: “Finally you mention what I have been waiting to hear all evening. I just did not want to come right out and ask you about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Appreciating that Jesus Christ has entrusted you with the responsibility to preach and make disciples, you will certainly want to share in that work to the greatest extent possible. Allow your love for fellow humans to impel you to do so. Prayerfully look to Jehovah for his direction and trust in his ability to aid you by means of his holy spirit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How Is It</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Society has received many letters asking how to handle matters if an elder or a ministerial servant moves, or if an elder is not able to serve in his appointed capacity for some reason, and how adjustments should be made in the five principal service positions in the congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In answer to the first point—if an elder or ministerial servant moves from the congregation or, because of wrong conduct, is no longer qualified to serve, the governing body should be notified of this in all cases. As to the five principal positions of oversight, the governing body made appointments during August and September of those assigned to serve in these positions during this service year. If one of these brothers moves or is not able to serve further in his assigned capacity, then it is up to the local body of elders to determine who should serve in his place. The governing body will not make new appointments to these positions. They will be handled by the body of older men locally, (or, p. 69)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> To fill a vacancy in a position of oversight It is not necessary that all those presently serving rotate up to a new position. Any of the elders can be selected by the body of elders to fill out the expiring term of the overseer. Or, a ministerial servant may be used on a substitute basis if there are not enough elders. Again, it is the responsibility of the local body of older men to decide how the vacancy will be filled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If</span><span class="font12"> there is any change as to who is serving as presiding overseer, field overseer or Bible study overseer, please keep the Society advised of the complete mailing addresses of these brothers and their telephone numbers, if they have such.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Normally the governing body will make appointments of additional elders and ministerial servants annually when the body of elders sends In these recommendations early In September each year. If brothers in the congregation become qualified during the year, the local body of elders can determine how they can be used to assist with the affairs of the congregation. But, the body of elders should wait until September to send such new recommendations to the governing body, (or, pp. 61, 67-69)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> If, however, an appointed elder or ministerial servant </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">moves into the congregation</span><span class="font12"> during the year and there is need in the congregation and the body of older men wishes to use his services, they can check with the body of elders in the congregation where he formerly served.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Handled?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">If they find that he meets all the Scriptural qualifications, they may recommend him for appointment, as stated In the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> book on page 66. (Please advise what congregation he previously served with.) The governing body will consider such recommendations at any time during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was not possible to tabulate the September field service report because many congregations sent in the old Congregation Report card which only shows the total activity for congregation publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ONLY the new Congregation Report cards are to be used in the future. This shows the total activity for congregation publishers, temporary pioneers and regular pioneers. Please discard all old Congregation Report cards. The new report card should be used as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CONGREGATION PUBLISHERS : Show total number of different congregation publishers reporting along with their total field service activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TEMPORARY PIONEERS : Show the total number of temporary pioneers reporting AND their total field service activity for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">REGULAR PIONEERS: In addition to showing the total regular pioneers reporting and their total activity, their individual pink report cards should be sent to the Society along with the Congregation Report card. In this way the pioneer’s individual activity can be posted on our records here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(Please see </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font12"> pp. 75, 138, 141.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In All of Your Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> it Is our desire to contact all persons in the territory assigned to our congregation, Isn't it? Why? Because we realize that this generation is faced with, the impending destruction of &quot;Babylon the Great, as well as the Armageddon destruction of all who have not taken their stand on Jehovah’s side. (Rev. 38:1-3, 8; 19:11-21) The Bible makes plain that it is only those calling on /‘the name of Jehovah&quot; who will be saved) But, &quot;how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?&quot;—Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What is involved is the saving of lives, others' and our own. (1 Tim. 4:16; Ezek. 3:17-21) So that no one is overlooked in this lifesaving work, the Society assigns a certain section of territory to each congregation and this, in turn, is divided up locally into smaller sections for assignment to devoted servants of Jehovah who willingly share in preaching the “good news.&quot; (1 Thess. 2:4) They keenly feel the responsibility to see that the congregation's entire assignment of territory is worked thoroughly as often as possible. When was all of your congregation’s territory last worked ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In a recent survey of some congregations in the United States reporting an “average” territory coverage of about once iu six mouths, it was found that, while some individual territories had been worked more than one time in six months, other territories assigned to the congregation had not been worked for a year or longer. It is suggested that a list be made up of all territories that have remained unworked for the longest period of time. The date last worked can be noted on the list, and, on a service meeting, special mention can be made of these territories and their locations. It would be well to arrange to have these territories worked as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If you would like to work one of these territories, it may be that it can be assigned to you upon request. Perhaps you can encourage other publishers to work with you in covering the territory. We suggest that the field overseer consider making arrangements for group witnessing on weekends, during worldly holiday periods, such as “Thanksgiving” and “Christmas,’' etc., for the coverage of such territories. Endeavor to reach the occupants of every home with the good news. If no one is at home and it is unlikely you will be able to return for some time, perhaps you would like to leave a Bible study folder and an older magazine or a tract under the door, keeping in mind that the message we bear means life to those who embrace it. (Be sure that such literature is left out of sight, so that it does not serve as an invitation for burglars.) What joy there is in diligently endeavoring to give everyone in each territory an opportunity to hear, study and respond I—Jolin 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Some congregations cover their assigned territory more frequently than others. The service committee of a congregation that frequently covers its territory may check with nearby congregations to see if another congregation would like temporary help in territory coverage. If so, the arrangements can be worked out between the service committees of the congregations. If two congregations wish territory to be reassigned, that is, from one congregation to another, then please follow through on the instructions provided in the letter, “How to Request a Territory Adjustment,” that was sent to all congregations in the United States along with their supplies for the 1973 service year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>0</sup> Appreciating the urgency of our work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making, it brings us much joy when we know that the people in all of our territory have a regular and frequent opportunity to hear the good news.—Rom. 10: 13, 14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• When student talks are based on material from the ’‘Guidebook,” how are these to be handled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Students covering material from the ‘‘Guidebook” can use individual initiative to develop these talks In a variety of interesting' ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At times a sister might discuss the information with her daughter or a new publisher. In that case the assistant could play the role of a student who is working on a particular aspect of progressive speech training. Or the discussion might be slanted to show how the material can be applied in the field ministry, daily conversation or in commenting at meetings. Both the sister giving the talk and her assistant (s) may wish to have the “Guidebook” open during the course of the presentation. Appropriate excerpts might be read directly frbm the publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There being more material than can be covered in six minutes, the sister handling the talk may choose to give brief coverage to all or several points designated by bold-faced headings. Or she may select material from only one section identified by a bold-faced heading, discussing and illustrating this point at greater length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brothers assigned student talk No. ■ 5 based on the “Guidebook” will, of course, speak to the entire audience. They, too, are at liberty to use whatever part of the material that they feel can reasonably be covered in the allotted time. When developing material from several bold-faced headings, they may wish to list the key points on a blackboard and thereby gain experience in using visual aids in teaching. The talks may show how the information will benefit the audience in the field ministry, in making comments at meetings, in giving talks or in other aspects of life.</span></p>

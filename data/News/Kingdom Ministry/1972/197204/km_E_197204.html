<p><span class="font8">Returning from their trip around the world, Brothers Knorr and Larson gave the Bethel Family very interesting reports. In our last letter we shared with you some of their experiences on the first half of the trip—as far as Kenya in East Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From Kenya they went to Rhodesia, then on to South Africa, where they joined in the dedication of a new addition to the Branch. They then flew to Australia. There they learned how the Strathfield town council at first denied us a building permit, but when all the neighbors signed a petition of approval the council reconsidered and granted the permit. This addition to the Branch will house their first rotary magazine press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a short stop in Papua, it as on to the Philippines. An addi-■ on to the home, also to the factory to accommodate a rotary press, is being built there, mostly by the labor of our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When our travelers reached Japan they found the building of a new branch home and factory well under way. It is located at Numazu, some distance outside Tokyo. The trip to Japan was most timely, for while visiting the concern manufacturing three rotary presses for us, certain improvements in design were recommended in time for them to be included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the way home our two brothers stopped in Hawaii and spoke to a gathering of more than 4,800 in the famous Waikiki Shell. Finally, after traveling some 38,000 miles, touching down in 21 countries, visiting 10 Branches (12 of which were engaged in building new facilities), Brothers Knorr and Larson were back in Brooklyn Bethel, February 20—in time to participate in the graduation exorcises of the fifty-second class of Gilead, March 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brothers and fellow servants, </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">. Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Act On the Call for Kingdom Proclaimers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’ ” This call, found at Psalm 90:10, Is a call to action. It reminds us that there is a work to be done. Personal and family study, also meeting attendance, are vital in our lives. They have various purposes, and one is to make us better preachers and teachers of the good news. Yes, Jehovah’s people are evangelizers and that requires that we </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">act. </span><span class="font8">Studying and meeting together take place primarily at home and at the Kingdom Hall. Heeding the call issued at Psalm 96:10 means moving out into the territory and becoming a proclaimer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> And what joy is to be found in that activity! You represent “Jehovah himself,” the Creator and universal Sovereign, by His invitation. The work Is under angelic direction. (Rev. 11:6) The truths preached are of the utmost importance, involving the lives of those with whom we speak. We please the One we serve. (Prov. 27:11) We ourselves are rewarded with eternal life. (Rom. 10: 10) So there are many reasons for being joyful in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> While we do not exert any pressure on our brothers to engage in the field ministry, it is entirely appropriate for us to set a good example of zeal in the field ministry and then lovingly invite or even exhort them to share our happiness in speaking the truth to others. Is it possible that every publisher in the congregation could be helped to sharq in April? Surely the spirit of the entire congregation would be strengthened if this took place, and what a mighty shout of praise to Jehovah that would be I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> To whom is this call addressed? Not alone to the experienced publishers in the congregation. Is this not a good 'time to direct some attention to those with whom we have been studying for a while? If they have come to an accurate knowledge of the truth, if their hearts have been appreciatively touched by what they have learned and if they are ordering their lives so as to conform to Christian principles, then should we hold back from inviting them to accompany us in the field ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> This month will provide many occasions for upbuilding association and activity. Having been stirred to increased appreciation by the theocratic events of March, fellow workers with God eagerly look forward to the service in which he now allows us to share. April with its five weekends should prove to be an outstanding magazine month. The April 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> will contain the special talk “Mankind’s Deliverance into God’s New Order,” and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> of April 22 will have revealing information on the theme “Where Is Religion Leading Mankind?” What a fine thing it would lie if all in our territories could be given the opportunity to read these two timely issues 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> This is also the final month for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> campaign and there will be many promises to follow through on and other prospects on which to make back-calls. Then there is the special talk to be given on Sunday, April 23. entitled &quot;Jehovah Has Become King—How We Know It.” Here is “food” we will thank Jehovah for as we listen attentively along with interested ones we have Invited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> How many will act on the call for Kingdom proclaimers? The command to make disciples, as found at Matthew 28:18, 19, does not say. Neither does the command to preach the good news to all nations, as given at Matthew 24:14, mention</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">Theme: Serve Jehovah the King Whole-souled. (Ps. 96:10; Col. 3:23, 24) Song 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">7 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include some Theocratic News items along with congregation report for March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: &quot;Act On the Call for Kingdom Proclaimers.&quot; Questions and answers. Might demonstrate points in paragraph 6 regarding following through on all back-calls and promises for subscriptions. Emphasize the im-Sortance or this. Can show two pub-shers discussing what they are determined to do. One tells of how she has gone through her witnessing case and searched out all house-to-house records, notes, expired-subscription slips and is in the process of arranging all of these calls in an orderly fashion and will schedule her affairs so as to contact each one of these persons so that they can have the subscriptions if there is interest. If people are not home, she will phone or make calls on different days and .at different times of the day. She may even write some letters. The other publisher is impressed by the plan and is determined to do the same thing. They arrange to check with one another during the month and also make some arrangements to work together. 27 min: The Benefits of Being Long-suffering. (&quot;Aid,&quot; pp. 1073, 1074) In introducing this part, stress the need for us to imitate Jehovah in his expression of long-suffering, a fruitage of his spirit. While it will not be necessary to read all the scriptures, be sure that the ones used are explained and applied in such a way as to make the main points stand out. The main goal is, not rapid coverage, but imparting understanding. (a) What is long-suffering? (&quot;Aid,&quot; p. 1073) (b) How have we personally benefited from Jehovah’s long-suffering, and how should this affect our attitude toward those who transgress against us? (Rom. 9:22-24: 1 Thess. 5:14, 15) (c) Why should Jehovah’s exercise of long-suffering deter us from violating his laws? (2 Cor. 6:1) (d) When we are undergoing ridicule at work or at school, why can we, as Colossians 1:11 says, &quot;be long-suffering with joy&quot;? (Prov. 27:11; 1 Tim. 4:16; Heb. 6:10-12) (e) What does Jesus’ example of long-suffering teach us about our responsibilities toward brothers who are very sensitive about such matters as food or drink? (Rom. 14:1-3; 15:1-3; &quot;Aid,” p. 1392, par. 2) (f) Why would our failure to manifest long-suffering toward those who are spiritually weak be injurious to them as well as to ourselves? (Mark 9:42; 1 Cor. 10:30-33) (g) From what will long-suffering protect us when one of our brothers or sisters speaks somewhat harshly to us? (Prov. 25:28; Eccl. 7:9) (h) What will enable a sister to be long-suffering with an unbelieving husband? (1 Pet. 3:1-6; &quot;Aid,” p. 1073, par. 6) (i) How can Jesus’ example help a husband to be long-suffering toward his wife? (Eph. 5:25-29) (j) When children do not respond to the truth, what hope can assist parents to be long-suffering? (Luke 15:20-24)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">(2 min.) Chairman: Offer for May will be the &quot;Know Jehovah&quot; book. Publishers enjoyed presenting this book in November and placed many of them. We want to be prepared to present it effectively this month. We are better acquainted with it now, having been studying it at our book studies and having heard the eight public talks on it. Good to review some points from book now that can be used in field to demonstrate purpose and value of it. What did publishers find successful in creating interest in November? Can also select points from insert in &quot;Kingdom Ministry&quot; of October 1971 and mention some of these.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Act On the Call . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(ConVd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">any number. But Revelation 7:9, 15 very encouragingly foretells that “a great crowd” would respond and enthusiastically serve Jehovah In his temple day and night. Why not be certain that we personally are responding to the call to act, and then patiently take note of Jehovah’s maneuvering of matters to His praise? There is much with which to be occupied during April, and God’s promise is that there will be rich fruitage.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Strength for All Things</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> There is much to do, isn't there? Study, attending meetings, field service, visiting and encouraging others, to say nothing of the unexpected ‘tilings that come up. No matter who we are or what position we hold In the congregation, there are times when it seems there is more to do than time permits. When those times come, do not forget Paul’s words at Philippians 4:13^ “For all things 1 have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” 3</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Yes, Paul was referring to God, who has unlimited power and who backs up his servants as they have need. That does not mean that he will perform a miracle on our behalf just because we have an unusual amount of work to do. We_ must </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">put</span><span class="font8"> forth a real effort, using otir various capabilities, but God will help us, strengthening us to accomplish any divinely assigned task. Note what Paul further says at. 2 Corinthians 4:7: “However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that of ourselves.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> So, it is obvious that there is no reason to be discouraged when there is much to do. In fact, it is t good to have much to do in Jehovah’s service. First Corinthians <sup>1</sup> 15; 58 says: &quot;Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor Is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” Rather than our experiencing discouragement when there is much to do, God provides for us to be happy as we keep caring for his interests. If we are unhappy in our abundance of work, could it be because we do not have quite the right Scriptural view?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Do you sometimes struggle with a student talk for the ministry school, spending quite a bit of time on it to the exclusion of other things? Well, it does take time to prepare a good talk and fix the thoughts in mind. Find joy in the fact that here is a subject that you will learn thoroughly and remember for a long time, maybe forever. Be happy In knowing that in delivering a good talk you will contribute a great deal to the spirituality of the congregation. Find satisfaction in completing an assignment and doing it well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Do others seem to find more time to engage in the field ministry than you do? Well, maybe they have more</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">experience in being good organizers and will be willing to help you with some practical suggestions. Possibly they have eliminated some worldly distracting activity in order to bring about more favorable circumstances for themselves, and from this you can learn. (Eph. 5:15, 16) But, it might also be true that you have family or other responsibilities that they do not have and thus they actually have more time available to devote to the field ministry. So after considering your own circumstances and making any advantageous adjustments possible, rest assured that Jehovah knows your circumstances. He does not withhold his approval because someone else, in different circumstances, is able to do more than you can do. (Luke 21:1-4) Rejoice in what you are able to do. Remember, though, that field service schedules can often be improved, and thus continue seeking ways to make such improvements, looking to Jehovah to bless your efforts. Proverbs</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">16:3 says: “Roll your works upon Jehovah himself and your plans will be firmly established.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Are you a servant who lias much responsibility? When you have put forth your best efforts, there Is no need to be depressed about the things you cannot get done. It is good to be sure, however, that you are well organized so as to get the most important things done. Keeping a daily reminder will help you so that nothing is forgotten. Maybe someone can he assigned to assist yon in some appropriate matters. Shouldering responsibility takes time and effort, but what a joy to realize that Jehovah counted you worthy of that position and that you have the confidence and respect of your brothers. Conform fully to what Jehovah in his Word has said concerning serving your brothers, appreciating that success comes only in this way. Proverbs 3:5, 6 says: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.” Jehovah’s active force, along with your sincere efforts, will accomplish the desired results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Yes. there is much to do in Jehovah's service in these “last days.” But to what other work would we rather devote our time? There is nothing that is more joyful and satisfying than having a part in the Christian ministry. And as we keep applying ourselves, always seeking to do Jehovah’s will, finding happiness in his work, it will be true of us as was true of the apostle Paul: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With Special Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Recently you contacted many of the public officials concerned with law enforcement to make available to them the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine discussing the question “Are Prisons the Answer?’’ The response was excellent. Both prison officials and police officers wrote letters of appreciation. In one locality, it was reported, that issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> was even made required reading for rookie policemen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> This kind of response is not new. People representing various professions have, in the past, expressed similar appreciation for special articles in magazines that you have distributed. This, of course, is in addition to the regular distribution of the magazines to people of all kinds from week to week.'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> You might wonder just what is accomplished by such special magazines and the unusual efforts to distribute them to those persons who are particularly concerned with that problem or subject. One of the good things that results Is the building of respect for Jehovah’s people, the Bible principles they live by and the work they do. Additionally, they learn that there is a group of people practicing these righteous principles and who, as a result, do not cause or add to the problems of the community but, rather, are an influence for good. Thus prejudice is broken down and the way opened for an additional witness at some future time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> We believe that many of those same men, mentioned above, who read the articles on prisons would appreciate the excellent articles in the May 1 issue Of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font8">Because of what they have already read, they should Ite quite receptive. As a result, some of them may be aided to appreciate the truth. And as Paul wrote to Timothy, it is God’s will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.’t—1 Tim. 2:1-1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>0</sup> The May 1 issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> is particularly appropriate for distribution to judges, the police and prison officials because it discusses matters that are of special concern to them. One of the main subjects is “How Do You View Authority?&quot; This is a serious problem to these men, and many of them will no doubt appreciate the viewpoint that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font8">takes on this matter. Also, there is one of the articles dealing with the problems of young folks, which is another matter with which officials constantly struggle. The same magazine contains a fine discussion of the subject “Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Call on You Repeatedly?” This should help in giving a tine witness. We suggest that you put forth the same effort to reach officials with this magazine as you did with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> There are other people who might also be appreciative of the information in this issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font8"> We have in mind those who are employers. Also, school teachers, counselors and school administrators. Disrespect for authority Is a common concern of all these people, and their problems are given attention in this magazine. What can you do as an individual —and perhaps working together with others in the congregation— to get this issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font8">into the hands of the people who may be benefited from it most in seeing that God’s Word has the solution to the problems with which they are faced?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> There are sincere persons in the world today who want to accomplish good on behalf of their fellowman. But they are often frustrated in their experimenting with various man-made remedies that really never work. They find that things just get worse. Then if they read what God lias to say, they may realize that this is what they have been looking for all the time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah is accomplishing a marvelous work in these “last days.” Not only are people hearing the good news preached orally as we speak the truth on every appropriate occasion but many are reading the publications that we distribute.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Are we making the best use of the magazines in presenting the good news? Appreciating the good that can be accomplished, are we presenting them with confidence? Why not use them fully both in our regular witnessing and for special groups that might be interested?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Korea's mild winter aided brothers in reaching new peak of 1,357 vacation pioneers for January. Bible studies increased 2,203 over previous peak to 19,059, with 14,606 publishers reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Philippines comes word that their 12 district assemblies were attended by 67,256, with 1,318 baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Is it appropriate for the audience to applaud each part of the ministry ' school or service meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Audiences composed of Jehovah's i people are truly appreciative. It ls.»i fine thing that they want to shosv that appreciation for the efforts of their brothers and the material they present from the platform. In some parts of the world in our day such appreciation may be indicated by applause. But applause should be spontaneous, from the heart. Also, it is usually an expression of appreciation for something out of the ordinary. And so, at large assemblies, including circuit assemblies, when special programs are arranged for and our brothers devote additional time and effort to their assignments, we find the audience applauding not only at the end of the talk but sometimes during it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But should this be true in our Kingdom Halls? Surely there can be no rule against it If it is done spontaneously and out of heartfelt appreciation. But normally we do not applaud these assignments because, for one thing, it can readily become perfunctory and so lose real meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is something all of us in our Kingdom Halls can do, however, to show genuine appreciation for the efforts of the one speaking and that is to stay alert during the talk, keeping our eyes on him and showing by the receptive expression on our faces that we are following liis thoughts and are benefiting. Also, we often find it possible to talk to the speaker personally after the meeting, letting him know that we enjoyed his presentation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">During the recent New York dock strike more than a million pounds of our literature piled up here, waiting to be shipped. But in the first two weeks after a temporary halt in that strike things moved fast. We shipped 834,300 pounds of that backlog. Besides, over 4,000,000 magazines finally got on their way overseas. Fortunately, this letup came just in time to ship out the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have you been reading this new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbookf</span><span class="font12"> The Bethel family reads a few pages each day at the breakfast table, and we hear that many of you do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have you read the exciting report about how the preaching work got started in Argentina? From one zealous publisher back in 1924 the work spread out along the railroad Unes, by bicycle and on foot to encompass he more than one million square ’’ miles making up that country. The report from Czechoslovakia is also amazing. Even before the second world war the influence of the Witnesses there in some places was so strong that the local clergyman simply moved out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You will also learn how the Supreme Court of Nicaragua thwarted efforts of the Catholic Church to stop the Witnesses. And, instead of sad war news from Pakistan, you will thrill to hear how the “good news” has spread there in the past forty-five years. Learn, too, how Jehovah has richly blessed your brothers in Zambia, even though house-to-house work has been prohibited and thousands of their children have been expelled from the public schools. The history of the work in Afghanistan, Dominican Republic and Taiwan is also included in thia report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Did you obtain extra copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> for those with whom you are conducting studies? You can still get more if you order them soon. Reading these reports could well be the thing that will move these persons to share the good news with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font12"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lour brothers,</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Wholehearted giving brings happiness to the giver. It was such giving that caused rejoicing as preparations were made for the temple in David’s day. “The people gave way to rejoicing . . . for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah.” (1 Chron. 29:9) We get the same feeling, do we not, when we give of ourselves with a complete heart in the Christian ministry today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Take for example the effort we expend in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign starting this month. We know what the information in the magazines has done for us and so we can, with a complete heart, recommend that others subscribe. We rejoice when someone says “Yes” to the subscription offer, for we know what benefits can be theirs by having the magazines come to their home for a year. So we have good reason to involve ourselves enthusiastically in offering to others the opportunity to subscribe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> How are you going to approach people at their homes during the subscription campaign? What are you going to talk about? The December </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> suggested that we might talk to them along the lines of “Benefits of Living by Bible Teachings.” It suggested a few introductory sentences that could be used to get a conversation going. But then what? Well, before you go out in the field service, we suggest that you open your current issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to the first article. Read the opening paragraph or two and get the main ideas in mind. If you work this into your conversation, it will be easy to open the magazine and tie in your discussion with what you are offering. (You may even read these paragraphs to the householder, if you prefer.) The January 1 issue features the subject “A Great Change Near—What Is It?” The January 15 issue includes the article</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Complete Heart</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">“How Can We Make Right Decisions?” Both subjects are practical, and timely, and they highlight that basic idea, “Benefits of Living by Bible Teachings.” In each of these' opening articles you will find that the introductory comments lead up to a scripture that is cited but not quoted. This affords you the opportunity to show the householder how to use the Bible along with the magazine. It will impress the fact that this magazine can truly help one to understand and apply the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It may be that you have developed some other method of approach that works well for you. Do not hesitate to use it. The important thing is to try to reach the hearts of the people to whom we talk. They need to recognize the seriousness of the times in which we are living. Their lives are at stake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Even though the first article in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> may be used as an opener to the conversation, you may observe that the material in one of the study articles is what the householder more urgently needs. If so, shift to that article. Or, if you are acquainted with the thinking of the householder, start the conversation with any appropriate subject that you believe will interest him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> This alertness to what the householder is concerned about will also be of aid when we make a return visit. By jotting down on our house-to-house record the subject that caught his attention, we will have a starter for our conversation on the next call. It might also be well to mention at this point the value of making a definite appointment to return, where interest warrants it. By this he will know you are interested in him and want to be of further help. Also, he can arrange his affairs, as can you, to be available at that time. It may be that a study can be started, and this would</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the outset of the month all of us were determined to be certain that the people in the territory we cover would “know Jehovah” or at least hear hie name during November. After spending 5,928.295 hours in talking to others about Jehovah, it appears that a big stride was taken toward accomplishing that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to our talking and stirring up interest in Jehovah, a total of 713,595 books were placed. These are now in the homes of the people. Every time they glance In the book or even read the title, they will be thinking about Jehovah. At least they will be reminded of his Holy Name. We hope they will read and study God's Word so as to know and appreciate Jehovah more fully, and we can take pleasure in our part in causing them to become acquainted with the Divine Nam6. called on to be long-suffering towat. ' worldly people and even our own brothers? (Matt. 5:44, 45; Jas. 5:9, 10) (b) What opportunities are there in our own homes to show love by being kind? (Eph. 4:32: Prov. 31:10, 26) (c) How will love aid us to act properly when others acquire possessions or privileges that we do not have? (Phil. 2:2-4; 1 Tim. 6:6-8) (d) Why does one who displays godlike love not brag or become puffed up about himself and his accomplishments? (Ps. 75:5-7; Jas. 4:13-16) (e) In what ways are loose conduct and fornication evidence of lack of agape love on the part of those who Indulge In such things? (Rom. 13:8-10, 13) (f) If others wrong us, against what will love protect us? (1 Pet. 3:8, 9; 4:8) (g) To have true love, what must we hate or speak out against and why? (Ps. 97:10; Rom. 12:9; Gal. 2:11-14) (h) What Is included in the &quot;all things” that love believes and for which it hopes? (John 6:60-68: 1 John 4:1; Rom. 5:5) (i) What benefits come to us when love moves us to 'endure all things’? (Prov. 3:11, 12; Heb. 10:36) (j) Why does love never fail? (’’Aid,” p. 1083, par. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Handle the &quot;Question Box&quot; in conclusion, emphasizing the importance of prayer in the lives of each one of us. Song 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You may plan your own service meeting for this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving with o Complete Heort </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">provide an even greater opportv , ty to give spiritually so the receiver may learn how to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> While January is a subscription month, some persons we meet may prefer something else. Why not carry in your briefcase a book to offer to those who do not accept the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font12"> subscription? You could place the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font12"> book and two magazJnes for (SO cents. Or you may want to offer one of the pocketsized books, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth, Evolution, Word of God</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher,</span><span class="font12"> along with two magazines, for 35 cents. Whether it is a subscription, a book or simply two magazines for ten cents that we leave with the people, the message in the literature can reach their hearts and start them toward a right relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>R</sup> King David admonished his beloved son and successor Solomon to serve Jehovah “with a complete heart.” (1 Chron. 28:9) When he did, Jehovah blessed him. You, too, like Solomon, want Jehovah’s blessing, and it comes as you continue to make the Christian ministry a wholehearted way of life. While the field ministry, using the subscription offer, is only one part of the Christian ministry. It surely provides us a wonderful way to express our appreciation to Jehovah.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Using Subscriptions to Announce that &quot;Jehovah Himself Has Become King&quot;</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">660 </span><span class="font13">AY among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’” (Ps. 96:10) That is our yeartext for 1972, and how appropriate it is! People everywhere need to know that Jehovah has become king. There is urgent need for them to identify themselves with his kingship. Why? Not only because God’s kingdom has the solution to all the problems that distress mankind but also because their very lives are at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How appropriate, then, that we will be starting off the calendar year by offering subscriptions for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> which clearly says right on its front cover that it is “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” It is by reading this magazine along with the Bible that many thousands of persons in all parts of the earth have come to know and love Jehovah and have become loyal proclaimers of his kingship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Persons who only a few years ago turned us away are now willing, yes, anxious to read </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and its companion, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">They are perplexed by world conditions, but they observe that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses are optimistic about the future and they want to know why. As a result, this past year thousands of subscriptions were sent in by interested persons on their own. And the total number of all new subscriptions obtained world wide came to 2,702,000, which is 240,000 more than for the preceding year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">What These Interested Ones Write</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Here are excerpts from some typical letters sent in by those who subscribed on their own. A man in Indiana writes: “Sirs: Find enclosed money order for $1.50 for another year’s subscription. I enjoy reading the magazine and most generally read it through the first evening I receive it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A woman in Virginia writes in part: “Dear Sirs: Enclosed is my check for $8.00 for the yearly subscription to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> After reading through one </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">completely and part of the August 1st </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> which was left by one of the local Witnesses, I’m totally convinced that there is only one true religion. . . . I’ll be looking forward to receiving my monthly issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> Please keep the remainder of the check for this wonderful society. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Another writes: “Dear Publishers and Friends: Please renew my </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> You needn’t take time to thank me for the few dollars extra. No literature is as valuable as that which the Watchtower Society prints.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From California a subscriber writes: “Dear Sirs: I appreciate getting your magazine with all the fine articles you write. I save mine and read them over and over and loan them to others to read too.” Another says: “Dear Sir: I am sending you $4.50 for a three years’ subscription to your magazine. . . . This is an excellent magazine, and I have just finished reading some of your books. They too are very good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So, as conditions in the world continue to go from bad to worse, more people are anxious to read these authoritative magazines. And the more they read the more they are convinced that they themselves should subscribe in order not to miss an issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Incidentally, did you notice that these interested persons did not complain about the yearly subscription cost of $1.50? A man in Chicago says: “I am over ninety and I enjoy reading the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> even though I have vision in only one eye. I only wish I had subscribed for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> sooner than I did. It gives you more for the money than anything you can think of,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Certainly the value of these magazines cannot be measured in dollars and cents. Why, they are as valuable as a person’s life! In fact, one man writes: “I’m alive today on account of the message in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">magazine. For one day I was at home getting ready to commit suicide when one of Jehovah’s witnesses knocked at my door with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! I</span><span class="font13"> read them and that’s why I’m alive today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Own Attitude Most Important</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Another and perhaps a stronger reason why we can expect good results during this campaign is our own attitude as publishers. When we appreciate something we are anxious to share that something with others, is it not so? In this case that “something” is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazines. So we enthusiastically urge others to subscribe for them, and regularly read them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One brother in New York expressed his feelings this way: “Dear Brothers: I felt I just had to write a few lines expressing my deep heartfelt appreciation for the recent </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> articles. Truly Jehovah is really pouring out his Holy Spirit on his organization. I don’t want to cite any particular article because they all have been simply wonderful. I am looking forward with eager expectation to future issues.” Another in Alaska writes: “Dear Brothers: I just received my October 1 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> in the mail, and I’m so happy for the information that it contains. It reminds us to ask ourselves questions on the condition in our home. Although we know the principles outlined, we need to be reminded so very often. I can’t quite find the words to express how I feel, so I will just say ‘Thank you for working so hard for us.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Does not each issue of the magazines contain material that is truly beneficial for people of all kinds? How fine it would be for as many persons as possible to receive the magazines regularly! Just consider the good effect that they can have on honest-hearted persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Both </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> help people to understand that God’s kingdom is the only real remedy for the woes of mankind. They show why we can have strong conviction that the incoming of God’s new order is very near at hand. This certainly can give right-hearted persons a solid anchor of hope in this benighted age of distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Think, too, of the help that these magazines offer in finding solutions to one’s daily problems. They have helped you, have they not? They can help other people too. There are many articles in the magazines dealing with various family problems—from those facing the parents to those confronting small children and teen-agers. Unmarried men and women are also wisely counseled on how to handle their special problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The practical appeal of many of the articles in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> has done much to stimulate interest in the Bible. The magazines discuss in depth the social ills that plague mankind, and they offer very practical and helpful suggestions for avoiding the same. Not only are alcoholism, drug abuse, immorality and other things in this world warned against, but effective defense measures are recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even the articles that we may think are more appropriate for us personally can do much in aiding those who are showing some desire to grow spiritually. This includes discussions of such vital matters as personal study, regular association with the congregation and active participation in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Interesting, too, are the reports of large assemblies of God’s people, the life stories of faithful witnesses of Jehovah and reports of how our brothers are maintaining integrity under difficulty. Articles of this nati” , can do much to impress others with the conviction that Jehovah’s witnesses have. They show that Christianity is a way of life and forcefully illustrate the difference between true religion and the false. You might be amazed at how many persons who are not Jehovah’s witnesses read these articles, and with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> can do much to aid persons to mold their thinking so that they can have the mind of Christ and the mind of God. They contain the solid truth of God’s Word presented in a most satisfying manner, food for the mind provided through the “faithful and discreet slave” and served “at the proper time.” —Matt. 24:45, 46; 1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasons for Urging Others to Subscribe</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When suggesting that others subscribe for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> what do we generally say? Do we emphasize the convenient size of the magazines, the large print, the fact that they carry no commercial ad-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">vertising and the very nominal cost of a few cents per issue? Are these the principal reasons why we personally read them? No. For while these are nice features, the real treason we have such a high appreciation of the magazines is because of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">material</span><span class="font13"> they contain—it is truthful, dependable, practical, timely and most beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So our greatest stress when presenting the subscription offer to others should be on the contents—what these magazines say that no other magazines say. And when we personally appreciate the magazines we can speak with conviction when we emphasize their importance to others. As a brother in Mexico expressed it: “When the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazines arrive, my heart leaps for joy, and on reading the articles I say within myself, ‘may Jehovah bless those who prepared them.’ It is not emotion, it is gratitude for what you do. I am a special pioneer and you cannot know the joy I feel in distributing the magazines and helping others to come to appreciate them as I appreciate them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But why two magazines? Simple economy in cost and efficiency might dictate publishing j&gt;nly one magazine. But there are other im* portant factors to be considered. For instance, not all persons have the same likes and dislikes when it comes to reading material. We offer </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> to persons who love righteousness and have faith in the Bible and who may be disgusted with the churches. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> on the other hand is more likely to be read by nonreligious persons, and in this way they are introduced indirectly to the precious treasures of the Bible and its promises for a better system of things by means of God’s kingdom. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> also reaches out to cover a broader field of education, and for this reason it is important to the Lord’s people as supplement material to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> So there is a definite need for both magazines. Each in its role serves a specific purpose. This is why during this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">campaign we can urge people, when appropriate, to subscribe for both magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In urging others to subscribe you may want to point out the large circulation that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> enjoy in so many languages. They have the largest of any religious magazines in the world, a combined circulation of about 15,000,000 copies each issue, which is many times more than the two leading Protestant and Catholic magazines </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">combined.</span><span class="font13"> And there are very few magazines even in the secular field that rival the circulation of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> Mentioning such facts should make people realize that millions of persons not Jehovah’s witnesses find the material in our magazines far more beneficial than that in any other magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Where to Get Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It would seem that the greatest number of subscriptions should be obtained in the house-to-house activity, since most of the people in the territory do not yet subscribe. So in the door-to-door work during this campaign we will want to offer every householder this opportunity. Explain to them why they need these magazines and the benefits of receiving them regularly in the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To do this you need first to read and analyze the current issues so you can intelligently talk about points the householder may be interested in. Remember, the content of the magazines is the important thing to talk about. Be like the pioneer in Mexico—help others to appreciate the magazines as you appreciate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not many persons you meet will subscribe at the initial call, but many times you can leave the current issues, asking them to read a particular article. Make a note of the placement and within a few days call back and get their 'response, again inviting them to subscribe. More people are willing to subscribe on the return call. Of course, some persons will not. But this does not necessarily mean that they are not interested. It may be because they are concerned about the shaky condition of the economy and do not fully appreciate the value of receiving the magazines regularly. Yet, they may gladly take individual copies. And, if we focus principal attention on the message itself, they may welcome us into their home for a regular Bible study. In this way we would certainly have fine opportunities to accomplish our objective, namely, to help them to appreciate that “Jehovah himself has become king.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At times we may get the impression that the person to whom we are speaking would read very little, if anything, in the magazines. Should this dissuade us from enthusiastically presenting the subscription offer? Not at all. But why not? Well, by having the magazines enter the home twenty-four times a year (forty-eight times if two subscriptions are obtained), it is much like having you the publisher making frequent return visits to this household. And, who knows, perhaps a marriage mate, children, relatives or visitors will read them. So never hesitate to offer a subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides the door-to-door activity, there are many other excellent opportunities to obtain subscriptions. At your place of employment have you approached your fellow workers or the management about the matter on your lunch hour? A brother in Michigan usually gave his magazine to a fellow worker, who in time noticed that another worker always had the same issue first. So the man said to the brother: “This other fellow gets his </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> about a week ahead of me. Why do I have to wait so long?” The brother explained that the other man subscribed and got it directly through the mail. To that the man exclaimed, “Now, look, Bob, why can’t I subscribe too?” Promptly he was offered a subscription for both magazines, which he quickly accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you go to school, approach your teachers with the same enthusiastic subscription offer you present at the doors in the territory. They too need to realize that Jehovah has become king. One brother in South Carolina says: “I have found another avenue for subscriptions—high schools and colleges where foreign languages are taught. During the last two weeks I have placed six </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> foreign-language subscriptions and two in English at such schools. Even having an array of foreign magazines when going from house to house lends itself to getting more subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What about names you may have on old back-call lists? Perhaps you can revive the interest of some who may have cooled off, and at the same time help them to resubscribe. However, if some with whom we are studying the Bible attend meetings </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regularly, </span><span class="font13">we suggest that you encourage them to get their magazines at the Kingdom Hall. We can obtain our magazines in the same way. This will save the individual the mailing cost and it will save work for the Society. Of course, if anyone who attends meetings wants to subscribe, there is certainly no objection to this. However, many, especially family groups, will appreciate being able to get the magazines at the Kingdom Hall for less than the subscription rate. Nevertheless, if some of our Bible students would miss out on certain issues because of their irregular meeting attendance, it would be wise to encourage them to subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And do not overlook the fine opportunity to send gift subscriptions. These may be sent to business associates, friends and relatives that you would especially like to favor. Writes such a receiver living in Florida, “The magazines were gifts from a devoted Jehovah witness and have been a blessing in my life.” Don’t overlook those that are confined or isolated and out of reach of the Witnesses. A soldier in Vietnam wrote: “I am writing to thank you and my mother for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> The reality has come to me that no peace will be brought to earth by mr’’ &lt;&nbsp;hands.” In the state of Washington the owner of a gas station, after reading a few copies of the magazines, sent in thirty-five gift subscriptions so that all his friends and relatives could enjoy them too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is another point too that we do not want to overlook in this campaign. We are all anxious to get a few subscriptions on our own. Let us be just as anxious to see that the magazines are delivered. They will be ONLY if the name and address, including the ZIP CODE, are </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">correct</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">complete.</span><span class="font13"> It costs the Society tens of thousands of dollars a year in return postage for magazines that are never delivered, simply because the address or zip code is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With these suggestions in mind, may we, by offering subscriptions, continue to work hard in keeping Jehovah’s kingship before the people in our territory. And may it be our united prayer that Jehovah will bless ou. efforts to aid many more persons to submit themselves to the Kingdom, to their lasting joy and eternal welfare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Challenge of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Teaching Children</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Teaching children is a challenge. You Christian parents can surely agree with this. It is a vital part fccf your ministry. The lives of your v-hll&lt;iren depend on it. And, when they “set their confidence in God” because of what they have been taught, it is evident that all the time and effort put into it are worth while.—Ps. 78: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What factors are involved in the challenge? Many! Finding time for family study is one. It means setting aside an evening or an afternoon and using other opportune times as necessary. Regularity is essential. There are time wasters such as TV and other interests that would make claims on your precious time. One family whose children are all serving Jehovah faithfully was determined to let nothing interfere with their study program. If friends came to the home they were Invited to join in or asked to wait until the family was finished if they preferred. Is your family study that important to you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The study time should be enjoyable to all. Not just a rigid, formal study, but, rather, a relaxed time for learning. There is nothing wrong either with making this the same evening the family has its favorite meal, or including also some time _ for family fun. Perhaps this could be as simple as singing songs together or playing a game that all enjoy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What program of study should be followed? This Is best determined by you parents yourselves. Many families work together in preparing for congregation meetings. This is excellent! When helping children to prepare for these meetings, part of the challenge is to teach them so they are able to give comments, putting these in their own words rather than reading them. Coming right from the heart, such answers show that the children have benefited from the study, making the truth their own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In regard to your family study, have you considered their special needs and interests, both in the time spent and the material covered? If you have teen-agers you may find that a family discussion of certain appropriate articles from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will be strengthening. In their case the challenge comes in embedding principles in their minds deeply enough to combat the temptations of immorality, drugs k and worldly associations, which </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font12"> they face in school. If your teen-age youngsters can talk to you frankly about the problems they face, knowing you are interested in them and their problems, it will make your teaching efforts much easier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Another factor to be considered in teaching is how to hold the interest </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font12"> children of different ages and with varying abilities to take in knowledge. It is good to have a family study in which all can participate, though some may need to have additional help. When children are very young and are at home with their mother during the day, she can help them to get a good start in serving Jehovah by regularly studying with them the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher, </span><span class="font12">possibly covering some material each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> If your children sometimes lose interest, ask yourself, Why? Would it be helpful to you to consider again some of the suggestions in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</span><span class="font12"> such as those found in Study 10? If more variety in material is needed, or you need to get the children more involved, then you might give them a little assignment to work up during the week. One might be asked to consider some subject in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding,</span><span class="font12"> or to consider </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure&quot;</span><span class="font12"> topics such as “Celebrations,” “Conduct of Christians,” “Evolution,” “Neutrality” or others, and then to discuss how the material applies in his life and can guide him in regard to school activities and teachings. Other children might be asked to relate what experiences</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A Witness to Officials</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">The January 8, 1972, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is one that can beneficially be used to give a fine witness to government officials. It features a series of articles on the prominent current question “Are Prisons the Answer?” We encourage you to make good use of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations could beneficially make up a list of all federal, state and local judges, policemen and other government officials who actually live in their territory. Then send to each one of them this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> with a brief covering letter and a copy of the new folder &quot;What Do You Really Know About God?&quot; Or, If you prefer, visit them and offer them the magazine in the regular manner. These men, too, need to lie given the opportunity to learn the superiority of Jehovah's ways, and this magazine provides a good subject with which to reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do you need more copies of the magazine in order to care for this distribution? If so, please order them right away. they have had in relation to the subject. You could as parents try assigning a question of interest for research during the week, to be discussed at the weekly study. Or, let one of the children prepare a subject from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font12"> for presentation to the family with a view to answering questions on the subject by others in the family. This would make for even more thought on the subject and help the younger ones to find the answers to their Bible questions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Caring for the Sheeplike Ones</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When a shepherd locates a lost sheep hurt and hungry, he does not leave it unattended, content simply that he knows where it is. He gives it tender personal care, providing it with food and water just as soon as possible. Our loving concern for those we meet in the house-to-house work and who have shown interest will move us to care for them just as diligently.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We have invested much time and effort in patiently calling at each home to present the good news, tactfully overcoming the objections of some, enduring abuse from others, and then happily finding some interest, perhaps placing some literature. Now what should be done about it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> It is proper to view things as' Jehovah does. “He does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Thus when somebody shows any interest at all in the truth, our concern for him ought to be immediately stimulated and our minds ought to begin to formulate plans for developing that interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When we look at matters in this way we begin to appreciate just how many opportunities for caring for sheeplike ones are open to us because of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign. When someone subscribes we arrange to deliver the current issues until the magazines begin to arrive through the mail. Delivering these single issues should never be looked upon as unimportant, routine work, but, rather, as an outstanding opportunity to build on the interest found and to care for potential praisers of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> On the initial call you may find it well to make use of one of the booklets that you placed with the householder. For example, if the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Good Netos”</span><span class="font12"> booklet was placed, you can show the householder that it has been designed so that one may use it to study the Bible. You could select a topic such as “The True -God” (page 5) and refer to the question on paragraph six to help the householder to see that to know the true God we must recognize his name. We can then encourage the householder to look up the scripture at Psalm 83:18 in his own Bible.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font12">If sufficient interest is generated, you can go ahead and demonstrate the study arrangement After this, another feeding program can be arranged for at a definite time convenient to you both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>0</sup> If a study is not started on the initial call, we still should bear in mind calling back to develop the interest. It is true that we do not always do what we know to be in the best interests of the sheeplike ones. Time slips by and we may overlook calling back. Perhaps we overlook the opportunity to deliver the single issues until the mailman makes the delivery. Finally you receive an expiration notice from the Society and realize that you should have called back on that subscriber long ago. It makes one’ think, doesn’t it? This would be a good time to make a self-appraisal and then to be certain that we are not letting some sheeplike one wander about in this system of things uncared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">' What a privilege Jehovah extends to us! Right-hearted ones will show that spark of interest that our training has helped us to recognize. Would fellow workers with God willingly abandon such a one? No. Rather, doing things in Jehovah’s way, we will begin thinking immediately in terms of caring for those of the right heart condition just as a shepherd cares for a lost sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Chalhng* of Teaching Children </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> If you are a family head, will you accept seriously your responsibility, meeting the challenge of teaching your children? If you are a youth, will you accept the responsibility to prepare well and to participate fully, thus contributing your share to the family study? All of us owe our existence to our heavenly Father and we want to show him our appreciation for the spiritual provisions he makes for us, ‘that we may be rooted and established on the foundation’ he provides and ‘in order that we may be thoroughly able to grasp mentally’ the tremendous scope of his Word and its application in our lives. Will you parents help your children to do this? They will thank you for it, if | you do.—Eph. 3:14-19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Question fflox</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Why is it important for one who is called upon to offer prayer in behalf' „ of the congregation to use sufficient * volume to be heard by all present?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Representing others before Jehovah’s throne of undeserved kindness is a great privilege. Of course, God can hear us even when we pray silently to him. But when wc represent others in prayer, it is only proper for all present to be able to hear clearly what is said. If they cannot hear, how can they say “Amen&quot; to the prayer?—1 Cor. 14:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Usually a brother offering prayer can be understood if he stands up, expresses himself with sufficient volume and speaks distinctly. Upon standing for the prayer he may find it advantageous to face the main body of the audience and not lower his head extremely, thus his voice will carry toward them.—Compare Matthew 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If conditions in the hall, such as the size of the crowd or noises coming from outside, cause such an interference that the brother praying cannot easily be heard without amplification of his voice, then, if there is sound equipment in the hall, those praying may use a microphone so that all may hear and express agreement. Situations vary in each congregation, so whether to use a microphone or not should be decided locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the brother is informed beforehand that he will be called upon to pray, it will aid in making his prayer fluent, coherent, earnest, rich in thought content and apropos to the particular meeting.</span></p>

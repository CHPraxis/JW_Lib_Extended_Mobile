<p><span class="font10">We had a very happy evening </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">March 29.</span><span class="font10"> here In New York city. At </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">u: 30</span><span class="font10">you could see a full moon corning up over the horizon, and many thousands of people had one thing in mind. That was attending the Lord’s Evening Meal at one of the Kingdom Halls. Two hundred and fourteen congregations (English, Spanish and French) are now established In New York city; that is five more than a year ago. And we had a remarkable attendance -U22SU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">mA</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only 235 partook of the emblems this year; that is 23 fewer than last year. But we had 2,266 more in attendance than a year ago. This was very fine and shows that many of the people with whom we are having Bible studies were there to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal <sub>w</sub> id to express again their firm belief in Jesus Christ. Many of these are going to be helped to come to a fuller appreciation of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ along with hundreds of thousands of others throughout the world within the next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bethel Family was very happy with its March production too because we made </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">2,135,730</span><span class="font10">. bound books In March. The demand for printed literature is still very-great world wide. So far this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">seven months, it lias been necessary to make 16,850,708. bound books at the Brooklyn' factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Interestingly we had to make seven reprints of the 1072 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font10"> bringing the grand total printed to .959.820. Many have written appreciative letters expressing their determination to continue on faithfully in God’s service just like those workers spoken of in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> who were faithful under trial. Jehovah's witnesses certainly are a living spectacle before men and angels of integrity and devotion to Jehovah God, and this all of us want to continue to be, and we - ant to help everyone else who has love of life to come to know</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">Make Known the Name of Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has given us, as his witnesses, the responsibility to preach the good news of the Kingdom and to make his name known among the people. It is very clear that he wants this done because sixty-two times he tells us In the book of Ezekiel alone that they ■‘will have to know that I arii Jehovah.” (Ezek. 6:7) We will have a fine opportunity to do just this in the month of May by placing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book, along with a booklet, for 50 cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is beneficial to call back wherever a book is placed and to encourage people to read it by telling them some outstanding points in a chapter or two that will stimulate their interest. Or, we can even demonstrate how to study this book and thus help the people who obtain it to know Jehovah! Effectively using it may require a different approach, but preparation on our part and having the right outlook on our purpose in using it will make us successful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Teaching people to know Jehovah by studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’ </span><span class="font10">book may take more effort on our part than with other publications such as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book. Our goal in studying with newly interested ones in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book is not necessarily to start at the be-Jehovah God and his Son so that they too may gain everlasting life. We are living in momentous times! What a joy it is to have a share in this grand work, to have a keen appreciation of what Jesus Christ did in laying down his life on our behalf that we too may share In making known the name and Word of the Sovereign Kuler, Jehovah God! Happy indeed is our lot, letting people know the prophetic truths!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">ginning of the book and study it in its entirety. However, we may want to use a chapter or possibly two to make the point that they must know Jehovah as the Creator and so they ought to read the entire book. But what then? You may decide to study more of the book or you may feel that the reasonable thing to do would be to refer them to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font10"> book for the six-month program of home Bible study iu which we teach them the basic truths from the Scriptures and help them to reach a decision as to what is the right religion and the right course to follow. We should recommend that they continue in their personal reading of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book and invite them to go with us to the congregation book study that is near their home. This is very good to do right away, for if they go they will quickly benefit from associating with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> But how do we go about demonstrating how they can study the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book? What are the best chapters to use? And how many chapters should be studied before we refer them to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font10">book? This will vary with different individuals. Consider the chapters that appealed to you the most. Why. not use one of these in studying with the newly interested person? It would be good to use a chapter that we know well. When we speak about such a serious matter as knowing Jehovah and do so with personal conviction, this In itself is going to add to the impact of the content of the chapter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> By our using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font10"> book In May, the name of Jehovah will become more widely known among the people. As long as there is time to do it, we should continue to have a part In letting the nations know that God’s name Is Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING MAY 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Declaring Jehovah’s Name in All the Earth.—Isa. 43:10. Song 105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 mln: Introduction, text, comments, Question Box (by school servant).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Make Known the Name of Jehovah.’’ Question-and-answer discussion. Explain how publishers can interest people in reading the “Know Jehovah’’ book by highlighting points from a chapter such as 1, 2, 9, 19 or 21 on a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demonstrate how «a presentation such as the following may be used to show others how to study the book: “I appreciated our conversation last week because it revealed some of the changes that the Creator, Jehovah God, will bring to pass for the good of mankind in the near future. What is unusual is that most people do not even know the name of the one who will make these beneficial changes. Yet his name is the original and greatest name in the universe. The ‘Know Jehovah’ book you received last week comments on the seriousness of knowing Jehovah. Let’s read the first paragraph of chapter one to see how we can benefit from the actions of nations in Bible times. [Read paragraph one.] What has been the attitude of nations and peoples toward that name? Do you think it would benefit us to know more about that name?” Allow householder time to answer. Continue the discussion and explain how the questions at the bottom of the page are used to isolate the main points in the paragraph. Proceed on to the next paragraph as time and circumstances permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman then explains that after consideration of one or possibly two chapters, publisher will point out that the remainder of the “Know Jehovah” book presents a much more detailed discussion that the person will enjoy reading. At this point, invite him to attend the congregation book study with you. Then explain that knowing Jehovah is more than an acknowledgment of what he is going to do. It is a matter of knowing all the aspects of true worship and conforming to these. To make sure he believes as the Bible teaches, invite him to have a six-month course of Bible study in the “Truth” book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “A Review of the Book or of the Bible?” A talk. Also have a book study servant demonstrate this suggested style of review, using the material considered in his last book study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding remarks; include April field service report. Song 48.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING MAY 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Jehovah's Service Produces Joy and Satisfaction.—Acts 20:35. Song 55.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Introduction, text, comments, points in Branch Letter and Theocratic News.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Presenting the Good News.” A talk. If possible, arrange ahead of time so that one or two local experiences of witnessing to relatives may be related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">17 min: “ ’Divine Rulership’ District Assemblies.” Question-and-answer discussion. Highlight assembly date that applies to the congregation if your circuit is listed. Discuss filling out volunteer service forms and rooming request forms with clarity and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding remarks. May refer to meeting theme, asking for comments from audience on how field service brings joy and satisfaction. Appropriate announcements: encourage summer vacation pioneer plans. Song 49/</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING MAY 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Vindicate God by Integrity to Him. (Ps. 26:1) Song 109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">30 min: Why Goodness Is Important. (“Aid,” pp. 676, 677; w67, pp. 273-284) Ask everyone to use Bible and participate. In introduction, point out how vital it is that we ‘abhor what is wicked and cling to what is good.’ (Rom. 12:9) Hatred of bad protects us from acting out of harmony with God’s will, and loving what is good reflects Itself in positive action toward others. Then aid audience to get key points from scriptures and other references cited in answer to as many of the following questions as time permits: (a) What is goodness? (“Aid,” p. 676, par. 9) (b) Why should we be concerned about having the quality of goodness? (Ps. 119:66, 68; 145:9; Gal. 5:22; Eph. 5:1) (c) What is needed to determine whether something is truly good, and so what should we be doing? (Rom. 15:14; Col. 1:9-11) (d) What should others be able to see in individuals who manifest goodness? (Rom. 12:2; Phil. 4:9) (e) Who should be included in our expressions of goodness, and how will this help us to get along well with others? (Rom. 12:17-21; Gal. 6:10) (f) What effect does goodness have on our eating and drinking habits? (Prov. 23:20, 21; 1 Tim. 3:2, 3, 8, 11) (g) How can goodness be reflected in the way we care for our clothing and home? (Isa. 52:11; w67, pp. 281, 282) (h) How might goodness be manifested in our choice of grooming or attire? (1 Tim. 2:9, 10; “Aid,” p. 1172, par. 7; w67, pp. 283, 284) (i) What attitude toward work would show that we are displaying goodness? (Eccl. 3:13, 22; 1 Thess. 4:11, 12; Titus 2:9, 10) (j) Why would individuals be more willing to expend themselves in behalf of a good man than one who is merely righteous? (Rom. 5:7; “Aid,” p. 1411, pars. 2, 3) Give brief r£sum&amp; snowing why goodness is important in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Presenting the “New World Translation” and “Great Teacher” book. (See Nov. 1971 “Kingdom Ministry” for suggestions on offering Bible.) First time offering “Great Teacher” book; people have not seen it in door-to-door work. Most householders have young children or grandchildren, interested in their needs. Presentation may be based on points found on page 5 of book; it can help to prevent 'generation gap’ so common now, can aid to keep communication open. Publishers can be alert to note local news on juvenile questions; try to select chapter that fits situation and speak about subject. Could use Chapter 17 or 23. Show how &quot;Great Teacher” book and Bible go together. Can point out that parents have given a Bible and book to child as reward for having done something well; added incentive to continue to do right. Could use as reward for having done well at school. Some have Bible now. “Great Teacher” book itself makes wonderful gift for children; can offer four for a dollar so each child in home can have own copy. (Demonstrate a presentation of offer featuring points from “Great Teacher” book.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Get expressions from congregation on actual experiences in placing Bible or “Great Teacher” book, what appeals to local people. May wish to try offering “Great Teacher” book in street work; many family people live in hotels or buildings we cannot enter. Best way is to approach them with book in hand. “Great Teacher” book also excellent for people of limited education. Urge all to get good supply of “Great Teacher” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments; refer to month’s theme. Song 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING JUNE 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Recommending Ourselves as God’s Ministers. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4) Song 116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6 min: Introduction, text, comments and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">30 min: Congregation servant covers “Questions from Readers” in April 1, 1972 “Watchtower,” by questions, answers and discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">14 min: Qualified to Be Ministers. Enthusiastic talk based on “Aid” book, page 1162, subheading “Christian Ministers.” Help congregation appreciate tfyat our ministry stems from work of Jesus Christ. He trained his followers to preach. It was their primary activity. Have someone read Luke 22:25-27 and discuss with congregation the importance of humility as God’s ministers. This also shown by our not having titles as do Christen-dom's clergy. (Matt. 23:8-12) Emphasize that God’s ministers are qualified by Jehovah. Explain who are their letters of recommendation. (2 Cor. 3:1-6) Help congregation appreciate who are Jesus’ “gifts in men” after his ascension and today. Stress the importance of other sheep being ministers of God even though not of anointed class. (Rev. 7:9-15) Are you personally sharing in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding remarks. Encourage making back-calls on all interested persons with June offer. Song 112.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That Jehovah is gathering ones of honest heart and they are being motivated to join in offering the fruit of their lips to His praise is nicely reflected in our report for March. (Heb. 13:15) There was a total of 424,311 publishers and pioneers in the field preaching the good news of the Kingdom, a fine new peak in proclaimers! Yes, there were 5,909 more of us in field service during March than any other month to date, and 14,898 more than for March 1971. Excellent! What will be the results for April? All of us will be anxious to know on receiving next month’s &quot;Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Review off the Book or off the Bible?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The principal book studied by Jehovah’s witnesses is the Bible. It contains the words of God, and it instructs us on how to serve Jehovah. It teaches us how to live peacefully with our fellowman now and it prepares us for life in the future. Because of its importance, during our study periods we should make full use of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The publications we are studying help us to understand what the Bible says and why. But after about an hour’s consideration of a subject, do we know where the principal scriptures involved are found in the Bible, and can we give an explanation as to what they mean? A fine way to find out is by a review of the lesson. At the conclusion of the study, rather than reviewing the publication being studied, would it not often be advantageous to review the Bible</span></p></li></ul>

If only a few verses were covered, these can be read. If many were covered, it would be good to read key texts that highlight the theme of the study. The book study servant can present a review to the group on the information as they follow along in their Bibles. Different ones could possibly participate in reading the verses and the book study servant might ask questions on principal points as they proceed. This will make the brief review of the subject material one that is directly from the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">In our study of other publications, the verses may be in different parts of the Bible but the same style of Scriptural review can be used. Such reviews may also be used effectively on home Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The results for tjiose using this style of review have l&gt;een very gratifying and enlightening. It gives the book study conductor an opportunity to see how much the group is learning and remembering. Some brothers have found it practical to make a few notes in the margin of their Bibles during the course of the study or the review, and these are very helpful in the field service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In the future as we open our Bibles to that particular section, we will find that our comprehension will be much better because we looked up the scriptures and reviewed the Bible and not just the book.</span></p></li></ul>

As an example, the facilities in Toledo, Ohio, are not as large as those in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and although the Cleveland circuits are slightly closer to Toledo, it would l&gt;e best for them to attend Pittsburgh, where there will be plenty of room.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Is it possible that we can get so busy taking care of certain theocratic activities that we keep overlooking or neglecting to witness to our unbelieving parents or other relatives? Paul, in quoting from the Law, said: “ ‘Honor your father and your mother’; which is the first command with a promise.” (Eph. 6:2) The best thing we can do for our parents if they are yet unbelieving is to show them the truth. In doing so, of course, it is good to be tactful. You might ask yourself : ‘‘What am I doing to encourage those in my family who have not yet accepted the truth?” If away from home, we might aid them by writing letters regularly and including comments on the blessings that we have had from Jehovah and those that we still anticipate. In doing this we might write out a scripture or relate an experience we had. We might send a gift subscription or we can mall a copy of an appropriate issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> that we feel may be of particular interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If one is living at home with his parents, what a fine opportunity he would have to give a witness by letting the family observe how his study of the Bible has taught him Christian conduct. He should be anxious and willing to do things around the home without being asked. Close ties can be made with our parents by taking more</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Are there persons who are newly associated with your congregation who would like to have their own bound volumes?

We will be glad to supply them at the reduced price of $1.50 per volume until all of them are gone. of an interest in what they are doing. Your being kind, polite, appreciative and respectful are bound to win the silent praise of unbelieving parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> One young Witness who learned the truth while going to school gave his unbelieving parents a Bible as a gift and wrote this note on the flyleaf of the Bible: “Dear Mom and Dad, For all the years you both worked to bring me up as you did, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. You raised me with the responsibilities of great parents. Whether you know it or not, you have both used Bible principles to do the job. I w’ould like to repay you both by studying this true book with you that will definitely lead us all to an eternal life here on earth. Without a knowledge of the Bible, this is Impossible. (John 17:3) I would like nothing better than to have both of you living together with your family forever. Love.....” As a result of this gift</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Question ($ox</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">• What kind of publications should be found in the Kingdom Hall library?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Kingdom Hall library is a Bible study library. Bibles, current publications of the Society (including &quot;Indexes&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Ministry&quot;) and a good dictionary are essential. If you have them, &quot;Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Awake!&quot; bound volumes from past years and older publications of the Society will be helpful. When available, encyclopediaSj atlases, or books on grammar and history may be useful, but we do not recommend purchasing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not necessary to include books on health, genetics, politics, science, mathematics, etc., which one might have in a personal library. It is inadvisable to have books on spiritism, mysticism, higher criticism, evolution or fiction in the library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The school servant is responsible for the library and for putting in new publications and bound volumes of the Society as soon as they are available. He would do well to mark on the inside cover of each book that it is the property of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everyone should cooperate in keeping the books clean and in good condition. Small children should not be allowed to play with library books, for they may damage them. At least once a year the school servant should have someone check over the books to see if any need repair or replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">bly. Treat it like cash. Replacements will not be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Be sure to attend all four days of the “Divine Rulership’’ District Assembly.</span></p>

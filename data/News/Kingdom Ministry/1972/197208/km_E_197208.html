<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’”—Ps. 96:10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QW ^Kingdom ^PuWisfe/tS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">The other day we heard some older brothers talking about the use that is being made of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font11"> in the field service. Wonderful work is being done with those magazines. During June 6,969,779 copies were placed in the United States and 2,855,377 more were sent out to subscribers. But the brothers wondered whether the arrangement for publishers to obtain their personal copies at the Kingdom Hall had affected the total number actually being distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Could it? Yes. When our personal subscriptions expired, if we simply took our study copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> from our distributors’ supply, without increasing our order, that would mean that about 850,000 magazines a month—over 10,000,000 a year—would be withdrawn from use in the field service; and then, of course, that does not include the number of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> copies that we may take for our own use. For each publisher, it is just one magazine at a time, but they add up quickly when many publishers are considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Has this really happened? Well, from the factory we learned that during May the drop in subscription copies mailed was 285,000 more than the increase in distributors’ copies sent out. And in June the difference was 620,000 copies. So, perhaps to some extent that is what has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Could we get more of the magazines out into the field again? It would be a fine thing to do. Soon we will be having in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> some of the excellent talks that we hoard at the recent district assemblies; these put squarely before each person the issue concerning divine rulership. We encourage you to make full use of them. When you put in your order for extra copies of the special issues for October, why not also consider whether you could beneficially increase your regular order for magazines. In the months ahead</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilling Our Responsibility to Preach</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “This good news of the kingdom will be preached.” (Matt. 24:14) There was no doubt in Jesus’ mind about this being done and that it would be accomplished in all the inhabited earth before the end came. Jesus had confidence, knowing that there would be many willing ones of his disciples who would respond to the leadings of Jehovah’s spirit. (Ps. 110:3) Thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, the end, while near, has not yet come. How will we use the remaining time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The closer we get to the “great tribulation,” the less time we have to help sincere ones to flee from the doomed old system of things. We are offering to men of all nations their only hope for salvation. Wisely, then, in the little time that remains, we will be on guard so that we do not lose the sense of urgency that is associated with our work of helping to mark honest-hearted ones before it is too late.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> While we have a fuller understanding of the “variety of ministries,” it does not mean that the need to preach has diminished. A balanced view of the activities that make up the Christian ministry includes appreciation of our part in fulfilling Matthew 24:14 and 28:19, 20. Hence, in view of the great urgency to preach and to make disciples, let us continue to widen out our opportunities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Looking at the work done by all of you in declaring the good news and in feeding Jehovah’s “sheep” in the United States, it is evident that much good work is let’s demonstrate our faith by putting forth every effort to keep this matter of divine rulership before the people everywhere.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">being done. Each month, on the average, about six million hours are spent in the preaching and teaching activity. Every year more are sharing in the marking work too, for which thanks and praise go to Jehovah, who brings the increase. In looking over the reports you have submitted, however, we do observe a trend that bears mentioning, as far as each one of us individually is concerned. We note that while there has been a steady fine increase in the number of new praisers of Jehovah for much of this year, the total hours, placements, return visits and studies have shown general decreases in comparison with the same months last year. For example, the total hours in April 1971 amounted to 8,197,565 in contrast to 7,157,116 in April of 1972, or over one million fewer hours spent in the field service during April this year than last year, and yet there were 14,390 more publishers this year. We call this to your attention with confidence that, if you can arrange to spend more time in the preaching work, you will do so. We want to take good care of all of our various ministries, including our preaching privileges.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> During August most congregations will be advised of the appointment of elders and ministerial servants. These brothers are very much concerned with the fulfillment of oui' responsibility to preach, in addition to their other important duties in looking after the flock. They recognize the need personally to take the lead in the field ministry. These mature brothers and other experienced publishers, both brothers and sisters, will be happy to render assistance to any needing a helping hand in the field ministry.

<p><span class="font10">30 min: Mildness Accomplishes Much Good. (“Aid,” pp. 1156, 1157) Audience discussion, using questions here. Primary goal of Jehovah’s servants is to bring praise and honor to His name. This is possible only if we reflect Jehovah’s fine qualities, including mildness or graciousness, in our dealings with fellow humans. (Ex. 34:6) (a) What is mildness? (“Aid,” p. 1156) (b) How can we acquire mildness? (Gal. 5:22, 23; “Aid,” p. 1156, par. 8) (c) How does the case of Jesus show that mildness is a quality of strength? (Matt. 11:29; 23:13-39) (d) What should give us strong motivation to manifest mildness? (Titus 3:1-7) (e) What can our displaying mildness accomplish when we have to deal with opposers? (Prov. 15:1; 25:15) (f) While the Bible speaks of clothing oneself with mildness, why can it not be said that mildness is a veneer? (Col. 3:10, 12; Eph. 4:22-24) (g) Should we be questioned by officials or teachers in a harsh manner, is mildness on our part out of pla’ce? (1 Pet. 3:15) (h) What good effect can a wife’s displaying mildness have on an unbelieving husband? (1 Pet. 3:1-5) (i) Why is mildness appropriate on the part of elders in the congregation when correction is administered? (Gal. 6:1; 2 Tim. 2:24, 25) (j) Why do we need mildness when we are corrected? (Eccl. 10:4; “Aid,” p. 1157, par. 1) 10 min: Concluding comments. Cover points in article on “Pittsburgh, Annual Meeting.” Song 119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Song 44. Introduction, text and comments. School about to begin. Encourage school-age publishers to offer “Evolution” book to teachers and classmates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilling Our Responsibility (COH#’(Z) </span><span class="font11">getting started or in preparing something effective to say when going to the doors is often very much appreciated. Reviewing the field service arrangements in effect in the congregation, the elders may find ways to make these more practical and convenient or to stimulate participation. Wherever possible, a capable brother should be on hand to take the lead. It is important to have the best arrangements possible on weekends and throughout each week for group witnessing, so that, regardless of each one’s individual circumstances, he will be able to share regularly in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> After completing the marking of those to be spared, the “man clothed with the linen” returned and reported to Jehovah with the words: “I have done just as you have commanded me.” (Ezek. 9:11) The faithful remnant of the Lord’s anointed, pictured by the ‘man in linen,’ will also be able to say this by the time the “great tribulation” is to begin. Individually, how will we be able to answer? This will depend upon how well we fulfill our responsibility to preach the good news of the Kingdom NOW!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">824,065! That was the number of Bibles and books that we placed during the month of June. And how many did we place last June? 738,974. So we enjoyed placing some 85,000 more this year. As we all appreciate, such a report results from the combined efforts of all of us. Individually we may place only one or two books, and it may not seem like much. But what a tremendous amount is accomplished when we all share! And who knows how those books may affect the ones who obtained them? Some of those persons may become our brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Teacher</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus is the Great Teacher. Not only did he have accurate knowledge, but he also knew how to instruct in a way that really benefited his listeners. As disciples or “learners” of Jesus, we -want to copy him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus loved people. He took his listeners into consideration when he taught, and he spoke in a way that reached their hearts. By the skillful use of illustrations, as well as questions, he made his presentations effective and interesting to both young and old.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During August we will be showing a love like that of Jesus as we acquaint others with the Great Teacher and his heavenly Father. One way we will do this is by featuring the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book in our field ministry. This publication contains many of the very illustrations that Jesus so skillfully used to instruct his listeners in righteous principles, and is it not true that such instruction is needed more today than ever before? Many parents now see the need to teach their children about God to counteract the godlessness that surrounds their little loved ones. They will readily welcome the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher </span><span class="font11">book, as did a mother who, after reading the invitation on the back of the June 15, 1972, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> wrote: “Gentlemen, would you please send me a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher.</span><span class="font11"> I have a five-year-old son, and as yet I have not taken him to church. I hope this book will help me explain about God and help me give him the right kind of guidance.”</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Has the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book really proved effective among young ones? Yes! A letter at hand reads: “Thank you for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher </span><span class="font11">book. My eight-year-old and five-year-old are able to understand the more important things. My eightyear-old son Bussell is conducting a Bible study with a schoolmate in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book, and the five-year-old amazes us with her good thoughts and deeds.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> One young publisher, eight years of age, in a short time placed twenty-one copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book with schoolmates. One day ten children asked her for a copy. Perhaps the basis of that young sister’s success was her simplicity in demonstrating the book to her schoolmates. We can use that same simplicity in offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book. For example, we could draw attention to the illustration on page 16 and say: “Have you ever noticed how young persons are fascinated by the natural creation? Have you thought of using this as an opportunity to instill in these little ones an appreciation for the One who made all things? No doubt this could be done by asking [read from book]: ‘So when we see beautiful flowers, whom are we going to thank for them? . . : ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> When speaking with parents, be sure to offer to demonstrate the ease with which the book can be used in teaching children. For example, many parents would like to know how they can teach their children to pray and learn the benefits of prayer. The illustration on page 49 can be used very effectively, as can the surrounding information, starting with the paragraph: “Jesus’ disciples once asked him to teach them how to pray. . . .” If time permits, as the paragraph is read, do as suggested, namely, invite the householder to get his Bible. If he is not familiar with the Bible, kindly show him how the listing of the Bible books in the front of his Bible can be used to look up Matthew chapter six and all other scriptures. Doing so will put the parent in position to do the</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Pittsburgh, Annual Meeting</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some individuals are encouraging everyone to go to Pittsburgh October 1, 1972. The Society hopes that the brothers throughout the United States and Canada will use the spirit of a sound mind and realize that an arena seating 14,000 people will not seat everyone from California to Maine. Here are a few facts that you should take into consideration:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Usually the brothers and sisters around Pittsburgh, to the number of SOO to 1,000, come to the annual meeting when it is on weekdays. When the annual meeting happens to fall on a Sunday many more than that attend. W<sup>T</sup>ithin a radius of 100 miles of Pittsburgh there are approximately 16,000 publishers. These alone could fill the arena. Within a radius of 150 miles there are 34,000 publishers. So even if these brothers and sisters would come to Pittsburgh on Sunday, October 1, half of them would not get into the arena.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> There will be no reserved seats for the annual meeting at Pittsburgh, except for members of the Pennsylvania corporation and the graduating class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The students are being taken to Pittsburgh this year for the first time, to attend the annual meeting and at the same time to have their graduation exercises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If people are going to come from faraway places they may be very disappointed in that they will not be able to get into the arena. Last time the annual meeting was held in the same place on a weekend there were 11,793 in attendance, and these were local people. We hope, therefore, that everyone will use the spirit of a sound mind. If any are promoting charter flights and special buses and other tours to Pittsburgh for the annual meeting they may want to think twice before deciding to come. The local brothers and sisters within the vicinity of Pittsburgh will very likely fill the auditorium.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Value of Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup>The Society annually sets aside the month of October for obtaining subscriptions. Why? Because of the abundance of spiritual food that can be dispensed to interested persons in this way. Subscriptions greatly aid us in our work of Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making. —Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine stirs up thinking on matters that directly concern people. Even persons who at first are not particularly interested in the Bible enjoy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> As they read </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> their attention is directed to what the Bible says, and gradually their spiritual appetite grows. How often this has happened 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> ‘But,’ you might say, ‘cannot the same thing be accomplished by the distribution of individual copies of the magazines?’ Not really. It is true that many people are willing to accept the individual copies, and they do give a fine witness. However, when a householder has a subscription, the magazines come into the home twenty-four times during the year, and each issue affords a fresh opportunity to get him started to think seriously about the truth. Of course, others in the home may pick up the magazines and read them too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> But, would not the same results be accomplished if we were personally to deliver the magazines to a householder? Truthfully, how many people are there to whom we actually do deliver </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font11"> issue? We may deliver them often; but sometimes they are not at home, or we may be the ones who are ill, or at an assembly, and so are not able to make the delivery. The issues that we may not get to them may have the very articles that they need, and to which they would respond. How much better to be certain that they get every issue by having them on the subscription list. We encourage you to urge all persons, including those you have on your magazine routes, to subscribe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Perhaps you are thinking: ‘Is it not more work for the Society when people subscribe?’ The brothers and sisters at Bethel are here to serve you and be of service to interested persons, and they are grateful when they have the opportunity to render such service. To them, handling subscriptions is not viewed as “extra work,” but as a privilege of service, and they rejoice when they see that there are many persons who can be helped in this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Those of us who regularly attend Kingdom Hall meetings and who will be sure that we obtain every issue can beneficially get our magazines there. But what about persons who are just beginning to attend the meetings, or who simply show a degree of interest when we call at their homes? It would be most beneficial for them to subscribe for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> So, let us ask ourselves right now: ‘Whom is there that I know who really would more fully benefit by being a subscriber?’ Then do not delay in extending a warm invitation to subscribe, now! And, during the October campaign, let’s really be wholehearted in offering subscriptions to everyone we meet in our field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

Too, we will want to make it available to our relatives and friends who have children. If you do not live near them, it may be you would like to mail a gift copy personally and separately send a letter encouraging them to read it. A copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book can be mailed anywhere in the United States for 14 cents, if marked “book” on the wrapper and no letter is enclosed.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">• Is it all right to call alone upon one of the opposite sex if interest is manifested in the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When we are doing house-to-house work, witnessing . on the street or elsewhere, we witness to all who will listen, whether male or female. If interest is found, it is our desire to make arrangements for a return call to establish a home Bible study. It can be readily appreciated that some interest could not be followed up and studies started if it were said that in no case may such a call be made alone on a member of the opposite sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whether one goes alone to make return visits on an interested person of the opposite sex or not is left up to each one’s discretion, depending upon various circumstances in each case. The matter of safety arid avoiding wrong appearances definitely should be given due consideration. We certainly do not want to stumble others in or outside Jehovah’s organization, or put ourselves in a position of danger.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If circumstances are such that one decides to go alone, it is usually best for the call to be made or study held when the husband, wife, or another member of the family is at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Often circumstances may well suggest that it would be wise to take along another publisher on the call. Remember how innocent Joseph w<sup>r</sup>as “framed&quot; by one of the opposite sex. (Gen. 39:7-20) If circumstances suggest that you do not go alone, and it is not possible to apply the above suggestions, you can give the call to a publisher or pioneer of the same sex to handle.</span></p>

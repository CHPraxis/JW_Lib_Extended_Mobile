<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 1972</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Say among the nations: 'Jehovah himself has become king,' ”—Ps. 96:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">You probably know that during the past several months there has been a readjustment In the size and boundaries of the circuits. And so, as of February 1 we have about ninety fewer circuits throughout the continental United States than before —a total now of 265, divided into 23 districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This change means that the circuit servant will not be visiting your congregation as often as before— only twice Instead of three times a year. You can understand the wisdom of this in the light of the reorganization of the congregations. With the local body of elders taking on and carrying a heavier load of responsibility in each congregation, it will not be necessary for circuit servants to come around so often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This makes it possible to transfer about ninety of the brothers from the circuit work to other nssign-- ments in the field. In the past these brothers have lieen a great help to the congregations, for not only has their counsel been very much appreciated, but also their example Of faith, zeal and devotion has been an encouragement to others. It Is good io know, then, that we are not losing the years of experience of these capable brothers, but instead the organization will be able to use their valuable services in other parts of the field. The organization certainly needs these &quot;gifts In men” in this critical time of the end.—Eph. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On January 5 Brothers Knorr and Larson left for a special round-the-world trip. Before they get back they will have visited countries in South America. Africa and the Far East. They should return about February 20. A number of these countries are in the course of building printing plants ami enlarging their Bethel homes. In connection with such a program many problems have to be worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This expansion is all due to the urgent need to inform people everywhere that “Jehovah himself has become king.&quot; As the world situation</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Wo have seen God’s organization grow in a marvelous way in recent years. Some of you are newly associated with Jehovah’s people, but many of you, too, have seen others begin to associate with the organization since you have. We are glad that as individuals we can now have a share in planting and watering the seeds of truth so others can learn of Jehovah’s way. But we all have observed and have come to appreciate that we need Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts and that it is “God who makes it grow.&quot;—1 Cor. 3:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There are many ways to spread the truth. The early Christians did this mainly by word of mouth and by reading to people from the scrolls. They did not have magazines and other publications to distribute as we do. We, of course, have found the printed publications very helpful in spreading the Word of life. But to a large extent our work is still most effectively accomplished by going to the people personally, discussing the .Scriptures with them, reading to them from the Bible and encouraging them to read from their own copies of the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">’During February we will have the additional pleasure of offering a subscription for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">for $1.50 or subscriptions for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> for $3.00, offering three booklets with each subscription as a premium. Will people take the subscriptions? Yes, of course they will. Many new ones are regularly subscribing. Many honest-hearted ones want the truth from the Scriptures and are learn-grows ever more desperate the need to let the people know the true solution becomes greater. Therefore, more theocratic printing facilities all around the world I</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">ing that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> can help them. How can you help them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> You know how valuable </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> is to you and how much you look forward to the Scriptural direction it brings in each issue. When you get the next issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> look through it and find an article of real value to you. It is likely that It will be very much appreciated by someone else too. And you will probably show the greatest conviction in talking about the article that meant the most to you. If you can help the other person to see the need for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> he may subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If people subscribe, they will have each issue coining into their home and they will have many opportunities to read something spiritually beneficial to them. Even it they are busy, when each issue arrives, they will be reminded again of their need to learn more from God’s Word. It may be also that a friend or relative visiting the home will be attracted by a particular article, read it and get the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> What if a person does not subscribe? By all means, offer him the two current issues. If he reads an article you feature, it may be that he will be helped spiritually, and that is what we want, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> When interest is observed, make a note of it and bring the new issues when they come out. It may be that he will be motivated to read something in each issue because of your personal call and because of your drawing attention to an interesting article each time you visit. Yes, your regular visits can accomplish much good too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> During February we will have many opportunities to offer subscriptions and single copies of the magazines, which can help others to get acquainted with the Kingdom message. There are many ways we can plant and water the seeds of truth. And, with you, we look to Jehovah to make it grow.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Theme: God Makes It Grow. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) Song 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “You Are Invited to Pioneer —Will You Accept?” down to the subheading “Do My Circumstances Allow Me to Pioneer?” Questions and answers. Encourage vacation pioneering during March and April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “God Makes It Grow.” Questions and answers. You may want to include two short presentations demonstrating just the offer of the literature: (1) After featuring one magazine primarily, offer a double subscription. It might be advisable to use a publisher who normally offers the double subscription. (2) Publisher offers book and two magazines when subscription is refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Demonstration: One of the brothers visits another brother in his home (1) to build him up and (2) share some good news. The visiting brother can consider some of the material from the Branch Letter and any appropriate news items. Something of local interest should also be included in the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Include items from February 1 “Watchtower” article “Courageous in the Face of Opposition.” Accounts report, if it has not been read. Song 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Serve with All Your Heart. Song 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Kingdom Ministry” insert from heading &quot;Do My Circumstances Allow Me to Pioneer?” to “Why Do Some Drop Out?” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17 min: “Can You Share?” Questions and answers. Read selected paragraphs; also Gal. 6:10 and 1 Tim. 4:12, cited in paragraphs 6 and 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 min: “The Offer.” Questions and answers. Spend most of the time entertaining upbuilding experiences the publishers have enjoyed in the field service or in other features of the Christian ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Encourage brothers to bring December 15, 1971, &quot;Watchtower” to next service meeting. Song 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Remember, Whether Young or Old, Your Creator. (Eccl. 12:1) Song 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Introduction, text, comments and talk on service theme for March, giving encouraging application locally. 20 min: “Kingdom Ministry” insert from heading &quot;Why Do Some Drop Out?” to the end. Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Get Acquainted with Prospective Subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman: We are always happy when in house-to-house work we find someone who will subscribe for “The Watchtower.” Often we find that these people know something about the work. They may have talked to the brothers before or had previous copies of the magazines. Most of us have observed, however, that there is a hesitancy on the part of many people to subscribe at the first contact. So it is suggested that we put forth an effort to get well acquainted with prospective subscribers during March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whenever Interest is noted or when a person takes the two magazines, make a record of it. Then when the new issues come out, take them back, drawing the attention of the householder to a subject you believe may interest him. It may be very effective to draw attention to an article that particularly appealed to you. Make your call friendly. Show interest in the other person. Endeavor to build confidence in God’s Word. Help the householder to see how he can be personally benefited by reading the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As you bring the new magazines and engage in friendly conversation during March and April, it may be that you can build a strong enough acquaintance with the person, and build a great enough interest in the Bible and the subjects discussed in “The Watchtower” so the person will see the value of subscribing. Make this one of your goals during March and April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Include two brief presentations: (1) The householder refuses the subscription but accepts the two current magazines, saying he would like to read them. (2) Publisher makes friendly call to stimulate interest and bring new magazines to person previously met in house-to-house work. 23 min: Be Free from the Love of Money. (Heb. 13:5) Audience discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman: Lead discussion with questions. Allow audience to comment freely; encourage them to do so and to use scriptures in their comments if they wish. (Based on “When a Christian Is in Business” in the December 15, 1971, “Watchtower,” pages 764-767. While this material was considered briefly in concluding comments on a previous occasion, this part of the program will provide opportunity for personal application of the material and for it to be Impressed on the minds of all.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From Jehovah’s standpoint, what is the main purpose of our being alive? (Isa. 43:10, 12; Phil. 2:15) In contrast with the viewpoint of people in the world, what is the purpose of a business as far as one of Jehovah’s servants is concerned? (2 Thess. 3:10; 1 Tim. 5:8; 2 Cor. 8:21) What danger is there- in becoming too Involved in business? (1 Tim. 6:9; 1 Pet. 5:8) (If desired, someone can read paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 of the article.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Why should borrowing be avoided? (Rom. 13:8; Prov. 22:7; Ps. 37:21) Why should written agreements be made? (Ps. 103:14; Jer. 32:10, 11) What should be taken into consideration by a person in a position to lend money? (Prov. 28:27; Jas. 2:14-16; Prov. 22:7, 26, 27) What can be said in favor of self-sufficiency?—! Tim. 6:6-8; Phi). 4:11-13; Matt. 6:33; Heb. 13:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Song 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Enjoy Happiness in Giving. (Acts 20:35) Song 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: “Presenting the Good News —By Happiness in Giving.” Questions and answers. If there are other local experiences, you may want to include some of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Are You Reading the New “Yearbook”? Invite congregation to look in as family read “Yearbook” together. Read four paragraphs from page 154, paragraph 3 to heading &quot;Operating Under Ban.” Use a good, expressive reader. After reading, family head asks: “How could we witness and have meetings if we were under ban?” (1 Cor. 10:13) Allow for comments from family members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman: Encourage reading of “Yearbook.” Do not miss out on encouraging reports from the seven countries reported on in the “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Joy from Jehovah. Audience discussion using questions below. It is not intended that all scriptures be read, but they will stimulate thought and give the brothers much to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is suggested that questions “a” to “e” be covered in the first eight minutes. This will allow for more answers to questions “f” to “j” and it will allow time for the brothers to read and comment on key texts you may select, (a) What is joy? (See “Aid” page 969.) (b)i What are some of the things that bring joy to Jehovah’s heart? (Ps. 104:31; Prov. 27:11) To Jesus and to the angels? (Luke 15:7, 10; 10:1, 17, 21) (c) What is the source of our joy? (Jas. 1:17; Gal. 5:22) (d) What primarily brings us joy? (Ps. 64:10; Jer. 9:24; Ps. 40:8) (e) What else has Jehovah provided for the joy and happiness of man? (Ps. 20:5; Phil. 4:1; Rom. 12:12. See also Prov. 5:18; 23:24, 25; Eccl. 10:19) (f) How is it possible that our field service to Jehovah Is with joy of heart and not burdensome? (Acts 20:35; Matt. 22:37. 39; Jer. 15:16; Luke 2:10) (g) How is it that attending ' meetings brings joy to Jehovah’s people? (Matt. 18:20; Ps. 19:8; Heb. 10:24, 25) (h) How is it possible to have joy when enduring persecution with integrity? (Jas. 1:2-4; Matt. 5:11, 12; Prov. 27:11; 1 Pet. 4:13, 14; Rom. 12:12) (p Of what physical benefit is it to Jehovah’s people to experience such heartfelt joy? (Prov. 15:13; 17:22) (j) What are some of the joys Jehovah has set ahead of us? (Ps. 145:1; Rev. 21:1-4; John 5:28, 29)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN DECEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We were offering the “New World Translation” along with the book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” And, before the month ended, we had placed 720,407 of them. What a fine effect these can have on God-fearing people! Of course, our Initial call was a witness to Jehovah’s name and purpose. Now, as we call back, we may be able to help some to become true supporters of Jehovah’s kingship.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>YOU ARE INVITED TO PIONEER</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>—Will You Accept?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">A</span><span class="font14">NY part we may have in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom is a source of joy. Regardless of the response of people in our territory, we have the joy of knowing that we are doing Jehovah’s will. And, if our expressions about God’s kingdom move the hearts of appreciative ones, we have the additional joy of seeing them make progress in the way of righteousness. Accordingly, the more time we devote to the field ministry the greater will be our joy. This is in harmony with the Bible principle: “He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” —2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Hence we are inviting as many as possibly can to take up the regular or vacation pioneer service. In doing so, we know that there are many who would very much like to pioneer but whose present circumstances and responsibilities prevent this. These faithful servants of Jehovah can draw encouragement from the fact that Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ are aware of their limitations. Remember that Jesus, in one of his illustrations' pointed out that the ‘soil of the heart’ may produce varying amounts of fruitage and yet in each case be fine soil. (Matt. 13:23) This is because the bearing of fruitage refers to making expressions about the Kingdom and is therefore directly related to the amount of time spent in talking to others about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So it is good for all of us to consider our circumstances and responsibilities. Could we bear more fruitage, that is, make more expressions about God’s kingdom to others, even to members of our own family? Are we in position to increase those expressions by becoming a pioneer? Yes, can you personally make adjustments in your present way of life to be a pioneer?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Necessary Qualifications</span><br><br><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>—Do You Have Them?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">It is good to remember that pioneers are appointed by the Watchtower Society, which is under the direction of the governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses. One’s ability to devote at least one hundred hours a month in the field ministry is important to the Society, but it is not the prime consideration. Pioneers should be persons whose example in Christian conduct is worthy of imitation. Others should be able to recognize them as persons who display the fruitage of God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Brothers responsible for recommending persons to be pioneers therefore must exercise due care in discharging their obligation. They know that a pioneer will represent their congregation as an appointed evangelizer. One who dresses immodestly and follows extreme fads in grooming could hardly represent the congregation in this capacity. And, of course, a person who is still enslaved to the unclean tobacco habit could not serve as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Other pre-enrollment requirements are set forth in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Lamp”</span><span class="font14"> book, pages 194-200. One must be baptized for at least six months and, after enrollment, one is expected to average a hundred hours a month in the field ministry—a total of 1,200 hours per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Vacation pioneering is an ideal arrangement for those who can pioneer on only a limited basis, say, for one, two or more months during the year. In fact, a person can vacation pioneer for as little as two weeks, devoting seventy-five hours to the field ministry during the month. A person desirous of being a vacation pioneer does not have to wait six months after being baptized but may apply immediately after baptism, provided he has been a regular publisher for the past six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If you are thinking of accepting the invitation to pioneer, first ask yourself a few probing questions: What does my heart really move me to do? Am I prompted to speak to others about the Kingdom because of love for Jehovah God? Do I feel pity and compassion for the people who find themselves in a spiritually wretched condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Does this love and compassion urge me to devote ten, twenty, a hundred or more hours in the field ministry each month? Or do I look at pioneering as some sort of status, something that will give me a certain degree of prestige and honor? Am I planning to enroll as a pioneer because my parents or marriage mate urged me to do so? Do I think of pioneering as a way to sidestep some compulsory, undesirable occupation? Do I view pioneering as an escape route, the lesser of two evils?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Right motives are vital. The right view of pioneering will enable one to continue finding real joy in this service. “What moved me to pioneer is that I wanted to please Jehovah,” writes one who has pioneered since 1956, “and I wanted others to know the truth the way I knew it. I felt I could do this better by pioneering.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Do My Circumstances Allow Me to Pioneer?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Having thought about your motives, consider your circumstances. What about your health, for instance? If you are not physically able to devote a hundred hours a month to the field ministry, you would, of course, not apply for regular pioneer service. As one publisher comments: “At present my health does not permit pioneering full time. However, I’m trying to be a good congregation publisher, and at times I vacation pioneer as I am able, always keeping pioneering in mind and before Jehovah in prayer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But maybe it is just a matter of not being sure of what you can do. If so, then you might try to spend a hundred hours in the field ministry during a month. You will then know better whether your health will permit you to vacation pioneer a month or two at a time. Why, you may even surprise yourself! Like others, you may find that spending more hours in the field actually improves your health. One sister, in spite of having a collapsed lung and a kidney ailment, decided to vacation pioneel' every other month. Results? Not only does she feel that her health has improved, but she also has had the joy of seeing one person with whom she studied get baptized and two more express their desire to become witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A sister crippled with arthritis was told by her doctor to walk a lot. So she started to pioneer. She still has arthritis but it does not pain her as much. This sister is also able to meet her goals. Even her attitude toward life changed, as she says, “When serving Jehovah you forget self and think of Him and the doing of his will.” Another writes: “Although I have been an active publisher for 26 years, I have been a regular pioneer for only one year. For many years I have been treated for pernicious anemia. Finally I decided to pioneer anyway. Then the seeming miracle happened—I really began to get well. My blood count began to go up and now I need very little medication. I also feel there has been a great spiritual improvement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What about your Scriptural obligations? Do youi’ circumstances in this regard allow you to pioneer? For instance, are you married and do you have children? One couple says: “We are pioneering with a little boy two years old. Our schedule is pretty tight, but not so tight as to take away the joy of pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Is your mate an unbeliever or opposed to the truth? “Many think it’s hard to pioneer with a husband that is not in the truth,” says one sister, “but it’s not so. I go in the field ministry when my husband is at work. One thing that is very necessary is a schedule. I have to have one in order to get all my housework, washing and ironing done. My husband gets up at 4 a.m., so that is when my day starts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Are you a mother with children? “In the fall of 1968,” writes such a mother, “I decided to pioneer, after I had counted the cost. I have three girls, ages 10, 9 and 7. I am a widow on social security and I have a car. First I vacation pioneered for three months, during which time I arranged a workable schedule. So with prayer, study and the aid of Jehovah’s spirit it has been possible.” Another: “I can say this has been the most joyous, upbuilding and happy time in my life. Anyone with children [she has four, ages 4 to 12] who can, should experience this grand blessing of pioneering. It has really been a blessing from Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What about business obligations, such as mortgages or indebtedness for which you are responsible? These circumstances may not permit you to pioneer. However, listen to how one solved this problem: “We sold our home, which would not have been paid for in this system, and we bought a very comfortable trailer which is suiting our needs perfectly. Years ago I never would have believed I would have felt this way. Now, it seems like the only way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These, of course, are only some of the personal experiences of many pioneers and how they solved their problems. But someone else’s answers may not fit your circumstances. You yourself must be realistic in evaluating your own situation. You have to face your own problems. If you already have certain Scriptural obligations, those that come with pioneering may overload your carrying capacity, making pioneering impractical and inadvisable. On the other hand, perhaps all that is needed to care for both responsibilities are some adjustments and changes in your way of life. Try organizing <sub>w</sub> your time and developing more efficient work habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Writes one sister: “I’ve learned to get my work done each day. We get up at six, and when the children leave for school and I for service, our home is clean. And what’s really surprising, it isn’t hard at all. We have more time for personal study. So even very disorganized people like me can become pioneers, and more organized and useful, if we want to serve Jehovah. My first year as a pioneer has taught me much, and I’m looking forward to learning more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another pioneer tells how she schedules her time: “When the children are in school I build up my hours so that during the two summer months I have more time to be with them. My one dedicated child has vacation pioneered with me for one month every summer too. I wish every mother could experience the joy of having her child follow her example as a pioneer.” The report on another says: “She has a limited income, has no husband, three children to care for, no personal transportation and lives some distance from the Kingdom Hall. However, she makes her hours almost every month. How? Her </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">schedule</span><span class="font14"> is the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">key</span><span class="font14"> to her staying in the pioneer work.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Why Do Some Drop Out?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">If you accept this invitation to pioneer, one of your more serious problems will probably be how to stay in this full-time work. True, some pioneers each year are lost due to old age and death—some after twenty, thirty or forty years on the list. Others are victims of “time and unforeseen occurrence”—sickness, accidents, failing health of dependent parents or children, financial difficulties, and so forth. (Eccl. 9:11) However, others (quite a few, in fact) seem to have only themselves to blame, since the difficulties that take them out often could be avoided. It is these avoidable pitfalls that prospective pioneers do well to consider beforehand; also those who have stopped pioneering should retrospectively consider the following points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Individuals who lack organization in their activity and who have little initiative or ability to handle problems may find it difficult to cope with the everyday routine of the pioneer life. If you are such a person by nature, you would do well to work for a while with some successful pioneer—a veteran in the service, so to speak. In such a case the proverb applies: “Two are better than one ... for if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up.”—Eccl. 4:9-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In this regard a person writes: “I have been a regular pioneer for three years and, as I look back, I know that it was working with other pioneel's that encouraged me. I vacation pioneered for three months before I was enrolled as a regular pioneer, and during those three months I worked closely with other pioneers and I was able to observe their regularity in service. Also the joy they manifested as they carried out their ministry really made an impression on me. They let me know that it was serving Jehovah full time that gave them this joy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In order to stick in the pioneer work one must have the right mental outlook on life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One cannot have an excessive craving for the dainty luxuries and trivial niceties of life and at the same time find contentment in the pioneer service. “From my experience I feel that one’s mental attitude has more to do with one’s remaining faithful in the pioneer service than all the words of encouragement spoken by others,” is the way one pioneer sister put it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pioneering is not for lackadaisical, selfsparing persons. Nor is it for persons who are easily discouraged and who quit when the seas of adversity get rough. One seasoned pioneer says: “Since I have made pioneering my career in life I have found that it is not for lazy persons. It is necessary to put forth a great effort and to work hard in the assignment. In twenty years of pioneering, circumstances have arisen that made it necessary to exert oneself in order to stay on the list. One year, because of a broken ankle, I really had to put forth a great effort to continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many who once pioneered, after reviewing why they stopped, may now want to accept this invitation to pioneer again. When one such person was encouraged to consider the possibility of reentering the pioneer work, his reply was: “I received your letter regarding my former pioneer service and how I should consider reentering. I can certainly agree with you that there is much joy in serving Jehovah as a pioneer and I would wholeheartedly recommend it for all of Jehovah’s people. Pioneering makes one appreciate more fully the organization. I only hope, as my wife does too, that we can once again pioneer, and soon. We are making the necessary adjustments so we can do this.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Counting the Cost</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Consider not only your heartfelt desires and motives but also your circumstances— health, economic situation, and Scriptural responsibilities. All these factors and others must be considered in what you will do personally about pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That is what one sister did. She said: “I decided to vacation pioneer month by month to make sure I could handle it and still take good care of my family. After several months I realized there was no reason to hold back from turning in my application for regular pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One must be willing to sacrifice, conserve and put up with inconveniences and shortages. Zeal, determination, stick-to-itiveness, faith, patience and a deep love for Jehovah and one’s fellowman are needed to be a successful pioneer. They are also qualities that enabled the apostle Paul to carry on in his special assignment.—2 Cor. 6:3-10; 11:23-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If you are a little short on some of these points, vacation pioneering may aid you to develop them. There is nothing better for making improvement than practice. Note what two pioneers say about this: “I really think pioneering has helped me in a great manner. It has enormously increased my desire to vindicate Jehovah’s name and help others in the way of salvation.” “Pioneering has helped me gain the stability needed to endure. It has made me appreciate that no matter what is lost or gained we have a share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After all things are considered, if you really are not able to pioneer, then continue to follow through on Jesus’ counsel to “exert youi’selves vigorously” in the service privileges that you now enjoy. (Luke 13:23, 24) But if you are able to care properly for your other Scriptural obligations while at the same time pioneering, either regularly or on a “vacation” basis, then by all means let your heart move you to do so! Accept this invitation, and you will be happy that you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The best recommendation and encouragement comes from the pioneers themselves, as this cross section shows: “I’ve been a regular pioneel’ for the past four months and I’m happier now than ever before.” “As I start my third year pioneering I shall be looking forward to many more rich blessings in Jehovah’s service.” “After five years in this full-time ministry, let me say that a young person is really missing the greatest opportunity if he does not pioneer.” “As I fast approach the age of 69, words fail to express how I value these 23 years of pioneer privileges.” “The deep-down happiness pioneering brings is something that has to be experienced to be appreciated.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Share?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Can young people associated witli Jehovah’s organization share in the Christian ministry? Yes, they can and they are invited to. How L can they? In many ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> All of us, young and old, can share the truth with others in the Held ministry and we should do so regularly. Do you? If you are in school, do you also talk about the truth on appropriate occasions to your classmates? Have you ever witnessed to your teacher? After school, when others are gone, may be a good time. Your teacher needs to hear the truth, too, and you may lie the only one of Jehovah's people with whom he or she has regular contact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The preaching and teaching of the good news of the Kingdom of God is the major work that Jesus gave his followers to do. It is es-I&gt;eclally important now just prior to the great tribulation. If people are going to survive the end of. tills system of tilings, they need to hear the Kingdom message and respond favorably to it. Can you have a fuller share in this part of the ministry?—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The Scriptures make particular mention of two young men, John Mark and Timothy, who did well in another feature of the Christian ministry. Of course, they preached tlie good news. But they were also attendants and ministers to the apostle Paul and others. Likely, they ran errands and delivered messages ; they may have obtained supplies and rendered other helpful services. They served faithfully, and later in their lives they enjoyed additional privileges of service.— Acts 13:5; 19:22; 2 Tim. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> There is much you can do to help the servants in the congregation too. Would you like to make yourself available to help with things needing attention at the Kingdom Hall? If so, mention your willingness to one of the servants. It may be that he will ask you to help look after the appearance of the Kingdom Hall—arrange the chairs, pick up tilings before meetings or keep the platform well arranged. Perhaps you can help to clean the Hall after the meetings. Maybe the lighting and ventilation need attention or you may be asked to see that the windows are closed after the meetings. There may be repair work or painting to do, grass to cut, etc. Your helping with such things would make you a very useful minister, and this is a part of tlie Christian ministry too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The Greek verb </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">di-a-kone'o, </span><span class="font13">translated “to minister,” literally tueans ‘to serve’ and it has to do with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font13"> service. Is there someone in your congregation who needs help personally to get to the Kingdom Hall? Could you help? Is there someone elderly or not well in your congregation who needs a visit? Have you ever visited someone like this? You might ask one of the servants if there is someone in your congregation who needs assistance in some way and whom he feels you can help. Some who are not well may appreciate your reading to them or telling them some of the things you heard at the last meeting at the Kingdom Hall. It may be that they will need you to run an errand for them, pick up something at the store, sweep the floor, shovel the snow or take out the garbage. Would you be willing to help with something like this? If you are, you will probably be encouraged to know that not only will your brothers appreciate your kindness In ministering to them in this way but also Jehovah observes when you show love for his name by aiding those whom he loves, and Jehovah will remember you with favor and pay you back. Hebrews 6:10 says: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.”—Ps. 11:4, 5, 7: Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Are there things like these that you can do at home? No doubt there are. Your serving well under the direction of your parents is also observed by Jehovah. Yes, Colos-sians 3:20 says: “You children, be obedient to your parents in everything. for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.” And verse 23 says: “Whatever you are doing, work at It whole-souled as to Jehovah.” You can be sure that your serving whole-souled in the Christian ministry like that will be looked on with favor by Jehovah.</span></p>

It may be that your suggestion that you and other young folks share in some congregation activity that has been planned, instead of doing something else, will have a very wholesome effect on others. Or in conversation, it would be a fine thing for you to bring up the spiritual view of things.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> During February, March and April the literature offer is, of course, primarily the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">subscription for one year, with three booklets as a premium, for $1.50. If, however, in your judgment it is just as easy to offer a subscription for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> with six booklets, for $3.00, do not hesitate to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> During the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign, it Is suggested that we carry one or two copies of the pocketsized publications, such as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth, Evolution, Word of God, Great Teacher,</span><span class="font13"> with us. Then, If people do not take the subscriptions, one of these books may be offered with two magazines on a contribution of $.35.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If you prefer, you may carry the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah’</span><span class="font13"> book or some other $.50 publication and offer it with two magazines for $.60. In fact, the congregation servant can see that announcement is made concerning what books are in stock,in the congregation. If they are older publications or newer ones, It makes no difference. We can carry these publications along with us in addition to the magazines, and we can offer them along with the magazines for $.60 if a person does not wish to subscribe. We want to help people to learn the truth and we have many publications to help them. We pray that Jehovah will bless you as you use them well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Happiness in Giving</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> You remember Jesus’ assurance that &quot;there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” don’t you? (Acts 20 : 35) It is for tliis reason that so many publishers find great joy in the back-call and Bible study work. It gives them such a tine opportunity to give spiritually to others—to people who have shown interest before and who may be willing to take a few moments to talk about spiritual things again. Are you sharing regularly in the back-call and Bible study work? Could you have a fuller share?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> many helpful suggestions have been given to aid us in making back-calls and trying to start studies. It may be that a review of some of these will be helpful to you. Observe the suggestions made on page eight in the January </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> and those appearing on page two, column one of the October issue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> But another suggestion: Who are the brothers and sisters in your congregation who do well in the back-call and Bible study work? You may find it helpful to talk to some of them. They may have good ideas to share. You may be able to go along with them in the field service and observe firsthand how they introduce themselves on the back-call, how they overcome objections, get the study started and conduct it in a most instructive way. With their aid, could you too begin to share increased joy through having a greater part in giving in the back-call and Bible study work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes discerning persistence is needed to get a study started. Many have found that when the weather is bad, it is a good time for back-calls because people are at home. A sister in Iowa called many times to talk to a woman who hail taken single issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> One cold, wintry day when the sister called, she was invited in because of the bad weather. In the course of the conversation. the woman asked why our sister kept calling. Answering the question led to a discussion of material in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Good News&quot;</span><span class="font13"> booklet, and a Bible study was started. In the course of time, friends and relatives sat in and enjoyed the study too. The result was that seven additional studies were started and this, of course, brought joy to our sister and to those who are now learning the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> One of our brothers in Virginia visited some of the unbelieving husbands of sisters in the congregation in an effort to get better acquainted. In one afternoon he started three studies in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font13">book with these men. Is there someone like this with whom you might study ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>e</sup> When you conduct a study, are you alert to invite ail members of the family to join you? By all means do. A woman in Ohio called our sister to cancel the study one day when her husband was home. Later the sister asked the woman if she had thought of inviting her husband to join the study. She replied: &quot;I sure wish I had.” During the week her husband told her: “I stayed home just to hear what this Bible study business is all about. I’ve always wanted to know something about the Bible. We’re just not getting anywhere in the church we attend.” Of course, the husband was invited to join the study. Within a month the whole family was attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. And now all in the family are Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">' The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1SG2 Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> shows that last year 310,449 home Bible studies were conducted each week in the homes of the people in the United States. This is almost 15,000 more studies being conducted each week than during the preceding year. Will you have an increased share in the back-call and Bible study work this year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Sharo? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">handling small assignments of service you receive at home and elsewhere. you can be sure that this will be observed and it will give evidence of your ability to handle larger assignments in the Christian ministry in time to come. So show industriousness in these matters. Remember that Jehovah will not forget your work and the love you show to him and his people, but he will bless you richly for your faithful share in the Christian ministry—Heh.

<p><span class="font11">• Is each publisher encouraged to have his own personal subscription for “The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Awake!”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many of our brothers are now getting their “Watchtower” and “Awake!” magazines at the Kingdom Hall. We encourage this arrangement. It saves the Society a tremendous amount of work and it saves you money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We will try to get new subscriptions from people who do not regularly attend meetings at the congregation —people with whom we conduct Bible studies or on whom we make back-calls, friends, relatives and people we meet in the house-to-house work. They should be encouraged to obtain subscriptions for the magazines. But after they are publishers and are attending meetings regularly, they might be encouraged to get their magazines from the magazine counter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For some this will mean quite an adjustment. And there will be a need for us to get into the good habit of going to the magazine counter each week to pick up the latest copies of “The Watchtower&quot; or “Awake!” for our personal use and for distribution in the field. Don’t neglect it and then find later that members of your family missed out on an issue and the supply at the Kingdom Hall is gone. Rather, begin now to make it a regular part of your activity at the Kingdom Hall to stop at the magazine counter each week for your latest copies of &quot;The Watchtower&quot; and “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Individuals wanting the magazines sent directly to their homes should not be discouraged from subscribing. People may have good reasons for wanting to have the magazines sent by mail to their homes. But, as mentioned above, it will mean less work for the Society and it will save you money if you obtain your individual copies of the magazines at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>

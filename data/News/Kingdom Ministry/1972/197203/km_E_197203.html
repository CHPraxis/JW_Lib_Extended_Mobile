<p><span class="font12">In our last letter we told you that Brothers Knorr and Larson were on a special trip around the world. The first half of their trip (from Brooklyn, New York, to Kenya, East Africa) might best be described as a whirlwind of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">They left here on January 5 and stopped briefly in Jamaica before flying to Peru. Staying there less than 24 hours, they flew on to Chile for a day. Then to Buenos Aires t Argentina) and SSo Paulo (Brazil) before leaving for Dakar in West Africa. Across Africa their pace was just as fast as across South America—only a few days at any one place. They left Dakar (Senegal) on January 16 and stopped at Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Accra (Ghana), Lagos (Nigeria) and finally arrived in Nairobi (Kenya) on January 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the daytime our traveling brothers worked in the branch offices, and at night, if not flying on to the next country, they spoke to local gatherings of brothers, dr they showed slides of the new developments in this country to the missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some of these branches have needed much attention due to the tremendous growth in the work. For example, in Brazil (where the present branch home is only five years old) it is necessary to build another with expanded printing facilities to care for the 72,000 publishers in that country. Just think of it, only five years ago they had but 41,548 publishers on the average! Similarly, in Ghana and Nigeria construction of printing facilities is under way because of growth in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the meantime the Brooklyn Bethel Family has been working hard getting out the annual bound volumes and the 7.972 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font12"> So far 0-14,000 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font12"> have been produced, up some 127,000 over last year. Approximately 2,700,000 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Know Jehovah'</span><span class="font12"> books have also gone through the bindery. We are glad that we can supply your needs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What the Ransom Provision Stirs Us to Do</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>The ransom provision has stirred us to do many things. On the basis of it, we have made a </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">dedication to serve Jehovah whole-heartecfly,</span><span class="font12"> and we regularly talk to other people about God’s loving provision for salvation. Because of appreciation for the ransom, we also attend the Memorial each year. We are </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">keenly interested In obeying </span><span class="font12">the command of </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">our 'k</span><span class="font12">ing Jesus Christ to cominbiirorate his death, and we are </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">grateful to have ou</span><span class="font12">r minds and hearts refreshed about the slgnifieuiieu uf wli’at he did&quot; in our .behalL=2<sup>_</sup>Cbr. 5:14, 15; Ileb. 9:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We are pleased when many assemble for the Memorial; but the big attendance is not our main concern, is it? Bather, we want interested persons to attend because the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">information presented about the </span><span class="font12">ra nsom </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">can reac</span><span class="font12">h </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">their hearts</span><span class="font12">. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Stiffing tneiff </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">to exercise faith and </span><span class="font12">to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">share </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">hi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;"> pure wor</span><span class="font12">ship. (Kev. 7( 14/15) Our own appreciation of the ransom provision is what motivates us to invite others to attend with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Often diligent efforts to Invite others bring unexpected blessings. Thus, one congregation in Ecuador had the joy of seeing the hall they bad rented filled to overflowing. (Eight hundred^persons attended! This had quite an impact on the congregation of 68 publishers. Within just five months thereafter, 17 persons manifested their appreciation for tile ransom provision by beginning to proclaim the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> A congregation of just 40 in the Zaire Republic (formerly the Democratic Republic of Congo) had the pleasure of welcoming </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">203</span><span class="font12"> Interested persons for the Memorial. That morning the congregation participated in distributing invitations. Then from 2:00 until 5:55 p.m., they played records of the Kingdom songs at the hall. This aroused J.he interest of those already invited as wen as of passersby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The good effect of the discourse was reflected in the comment made by one of the newly interested persons in attendance: </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Only today </span><span class="font12">have I really understood the jloc-trine concerfulig Ike ‘communion’ with Jesus, which we Protestants were obliged to celebrate without understanding. I have never heard such a simple explanation of this subject.” Might not many of those whom we invite to the Memorial be likewise benefited and eventually be moved to take the necessary steps to qualify to share in the field ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Another outstanding meeting that can aid interested ones is scheduled for March 26. How fine it will be for us to Jjear the special public talk, </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Mankind’s Delive</span><span class="font12">rance </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">info God’s New Order&quot;</span><span class="font12">! The nearness of that deliverance, made possible through Christ’s ransom, fills our hearts with gratitude for Jehovah's undeserved kindness. We want others to share that grand prospect too. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Surely, then, w</span><span class="font12">o will </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">put forth</span><span class="font12"> everyTnorr—to encoTiTTirre as </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ma</span><span class="font12">ny </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">as</span><span class="font12"> p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ossible to be pres</span><span class="font12">ent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> As our appreciation for the ransom provision has moved us to s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hare the good news wit</span><span class="font12">h .others^ niu’Tit not many’of those witli whom we are studying want to do the same?

<p><span class="font11">20 min: Training Younger Ones to Sit Quietly and Listen. The audience can be asked to comment on follow<sup>T</sup>-ing points: Why do we attend meetings? (Heb. 10:23-25) What do we learn from Deuteronomy 31:12? Parents are encouraged to bring children to meetings, even though they are very young. They need to be at the meetings with us. Who has the responsibility to train children to sit quietly and listen at meetings? (Eph. 6:4; Prov. 29:15) Is worldly viewpoint of permissiveness in dealing with children in harmony with what is stated at Proverbs 22:15 and 23:13, 14? (It is to be expected that there will be some disturbances until newer ones are helped to apply Bible principles in training and disciplining children. Also, young ones may be “teething” or not feeling well, etc.) Why is consistent home training needed? How could children become confused if required to sit quietly only when at meetings and then not be given any discipline at home? Ask xor suggestions as to how younger ones can be trained at home to sit quietly. (Perhaps mother can progressively train child to sit quietly while she does personal study, etc.) Consider principle at Matthew 5:37 and how it applies in home training, as well as at Kingdom Hall. Why would it be best not to provide children with noisy playthings to keep them occupied at the Kingdom Hall? Should library or some other place in Kingdom Hall be used as a playroom? Why would it be best to administer certain forms of discipline outside the main meeting area of the Kingdom Hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where necessary’ servants can talk to parents privately, giving warm encouragement and suggestions on training and discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Talk on material in “Question Box.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 mln: Some Ways that the Ransom Affects Us Personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) Chairman: Every year we celebrate the Memorial. It is a big event on our calendar. But how deeply does the death of Christ, which we commemorate, affect our lives as individuals? It has moved us to make changes. Bein$ imperfect, we need to continue making them. Appreciation for the ransom should deeply Influence everything we do. It should deter us from wrongdoing. It should be an incentive for us to cultivate greater love for our brothers. And, it should move us to put forth a real effort to help others to benefit from God’s provision for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In scenes that follow, we will see common situations. After each scene, the audience will be asked to comment on it, reading from the Bible and discussing how w’hat it says about the ransom can help us to do what is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(7 min.) One sister approaches another, in an offhand way apologizing for being late. Irritated, another sister replies: “Never do keep your word; last time I’ll w’ait for you.” Chairman asks: How could awareness of ransom have helped both of these sisters? Audience may base comments on the following points: Regarding undependable sister, show that, if we are imitating Christ, we put ourselves out for others, instead of expecting others to wait on us (Matt. 20:28); Christ appreciated the importance of doing things on time (John 7:8; Rom. 5:6); his followers must learn to be prompt and not expect everything to wait for them. (Nfatt. 25:10-12) For other sister, show forgiveness that ransom makes possible and how this should affect our attitude toward offenders.—1 John 1:7-9; 2:1; Matt. 18:33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) Employer approaches brother requesting that he not enter certain receipts in the books. Chairman asks: How will brother’s appreciation of ransom help him to resist temptation to please boss by agreeing to dishonesty? From audience draw out comments on value of ransom and danger of deliberately getting involved in sin.—1 Pet. 1:17-19; Heb. 10:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Brother relaxing, contemplating ways to share in the field activity because busy days ahead with special public talk and Memorial. Chairman asks: How does real appreciation for ransom help a person to reason in such an upbuilding way? Draw out from audience comments on extent of ransom provision and our obligation toward others.—1 Cor. 10: 33; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4; 1 John 2:2-4; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(4 min.) Chairman: Summation of points, stressing need to keep ransom provision before us to preserve right relationship with God. Give reminders on arrangements for the Memorial celebration. Encourage publishers to invite and bring others to special public talk and to Memorial. Make any other needed announcements.

<p><span class="font11">30 min: Peace Needed in Our Ministry. (&quot;Aid,” p. 1280; w59, pp. 741-755) Audience discussion, using the questions here. (To have God’s approval, to represent him properly to others, we need to manifest that fruit of God’s spirit—peace. As ministers we want to help others, both our families and others to whom we speak, to come into and maintain a peaceful relationship with Jehovah and fellowmen. So. we need to appreciate why peace with Jehovah is important, how we can continue pursuing peace and w’hat rewards it brings.) (a) Why is it vital for 41s to be at peace with Jehovah? (1 Yfet. 3:10-12; w59, p. 743, par. 9) (b) How can one come to be at peace w<sup>r</sup>ith God? (2 Pet. 1:2, 3; Col. 1:19-23) (c) How do some persons who were at peace with God get to be at enmity with him? (Rom. 8:6-8) (d) If we are to continue enjoying peace with Jehovah, what should be our attitude regarding his laws? (Ps. 119:165; Isa. 48:18) (e) Why is the oft-repeated Bible expression. ‘May you have peace,’ so appropriate? (1 Cor. 1:3; Gal. 6:16) (f) What wholesome effect does the “peace of God” have on us as individuals? (Phil. 4:6, 7; “Aid,” p. 1280. nar. 5) (g) What should we do personally to contribute to the peace of the congregation? (Eph. 4:1-3; Rom. 14:13-20) (h) When does the pursuit of peace require waging spiritual warfare inside the congregation? (2 Cor. 10:4-6) (i) In our contacts with persons outside the congregation, how can we promote peace? (Matt. 10:12, 13; Rom. 12:1719, 21; 2 Cor. 5:20) (j) How does our attitude toward governments of the wrorld reflect our viewpoint tow’ard peace?

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Gray-Headed Ones Are Appreciated</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Among God’s devoted servants, older persons have always been appreciated. Says Proverbs 16:31: “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when It Is found in the way of righteousness.” Today among these gray-headed ones are members of the governing body, traveling overseers and, in fact, a considerable number forming the backbone of congregation administration.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Frequently the other members of the congregation are simply amazed at how much older persons accomplish. Many have grown old in Jehovah’s service, not giving up even when things were difficult and response was slow. What a fine example older ones in the congregations have set in endurance! Many, even despite waning strength, continue earing for congregational responsibilities and having a full share in the field ministry. Their deep love and concern for others just seem to overflow and fill them with renewed vigor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The rest of the congregation is encouraged when infirm brothers and sisters express deep concern about declaring the good news. When others hear aged persons say that they wish they were younger and could do more, it causes some •ounger ones to feel a little embarrassed. This is because, though having youth, these recognize that they do not always make the best of their opportunities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At times certain older brothers and sisters may think that others can express themselves so much better at the meetings. But. the rest of the congregation want to hear their comments. They enjoy them. This is often because the example of an older person In serving Jehovah faithfully for many years gives real force to his words. Older ones who have begun serving Jehovah in more recent years know from past experiences that life without the truth is empty and meaningless. Thus, they can speak authoritatively and with conviction about such things as the vanity of gaining position in this world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Poor health at times limits some of our older brothers and sisters, and they feel discouraged. Perhaps they are able to call on just one or two homes at a time in the field ministry or must confine their activity to informal witnessing, speaking to visitors, writing letters, making phone calls and the like. The fact that their heart is moving them to speak about God’s kingdom proves that Jehovah's spirit is resting upon them. Is that not reason enough to rejoice? Then, too, it is good to remember that informal witnessing is often all that many strong, active brothers can do in lands where the witness work Is banned. Yet the good news still gets preached.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Even infirm older persons can have a marvelous share in the work of bearing witness to the truth. How so? Well, they can continue to pray for their brothers and sisters that their presentation of the truth might appeal to honest-hearted ones. The power of prayer should never be underestimated. “A righteous man’s supplication, when it is at work, has much force,” states James 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Some of the aged ones recognize that certain things tend to irritate them much more because of failing health. This is why their efforts to maintain self-control are an encouragement to others in cultivating this quality in fuller measure. At times younger ones are deeply impressed that so many infirm older persons maintain a predominantly cheerful disposition. This helps these younger ones to have a brighter outlook in connection with their own problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> There is good reason for the congregations of Jehovah’s people to appreciate the older brothers and sisters in their midst. Many, indeed, have reason to thank those who</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">that they understand what Jehovah requires o</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">f those whom</span><span class="font12"> He favors with bearing His name.

These older ones have used their strength and resources to proclaim the good news, contribute toward the upkeep of Kingdom Halls, assist others with their problems and incite them to love and fine works. It is because they have remained faithful that so many younger ones have been able to come Into a precious relationship with Jehovah God. And, all of us are especially grateful to Jehovah, for, by His undeserved kindness, both young and old have been enabled to remain loyal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Reasonableness</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> At Titus 3: 2 we are encouraged to “be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men.” This is true whether we are dealing with government oflicials, as referred to in Paul’s letter to Titus, or with •householders to whom we preach. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation</span><span class="font12"> helps us to appreciate that to be reasonable means to be “yielding.” To be yielding means “lacking rigidity or stiffness . . . flexible.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Being reasonable or “yielding” does not mean that we compromise as to what is the truth or that we put forth no effort at all to cope with objections. No, we endeavor to handle objections skillfully to the extent we can, at the same time not insisting that the householder listen if he tells us he is acquainted with our work and does not want to hear what we have to say.—Josh. 24:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When a person says lie is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">busy, </span><span class="font12">we could say : &quot;I wanted to discuss briefly a free Bible study arrangement you may be interested in. I would like to leave this folder and you can read it over when you have more time.” If the folder is accepted, you could inquire, “When would it be convenient for me to call again to discuss matters briefly with yon ?” By doing things in this way, what have you accomplished? First of all, you have briefly stated the purpose of your visit, as well as shown the householder that you have taken into consideration what he has said. If nothing else, your considerateness should leave a good impression. lie may agree to a return visit, or possibly be more inclined to take time to listen the next time someone calls. Your “yielding” at the present is with a view to greater accomplishment in the long run.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Suppose a person really is busy. We could suggest in a kindly way that he take some time to listen. But would it be reasonable to ignore his circumstances when he asks to be excused on that occasion? We know we would not appreciate it if someone came to our door when we were busy preparing to go to our meetings and insisted on talking about his religion. Would you feel kindly toward him if he failed to take into consideration your circumstances? And, what if you did agree to a brief discussion and he overstayed his visit?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Many times we call on persons who are well acquainted with our work and they just simply do not want to talk to us. In such a case we do well to remember what is stated at Matthew 10:13. And, if we are kind and considerate, even though a person is abrupt, possibly we can leave him in a better frame of mind toward the work of Jehovah's witnesses than he was in before. That would be a fine accomplishment, and it may pave the way for a witness to be given at some future time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We do not appreciate it when someone “pushes” us or fails to consider our feelings, do we? So, it is good for us to be reasonable, not rigid, insisting that a person immediately accept our viewpoint. By our explaining things clearly and simply, to the extent possible, and by employing teaching methods, along with a reasonable approach, we know it will be easier for right-hearted persons to understand and act on the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Will You Have Enough?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> At least two subjects are of the keenest interest to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. One is the impending destruction of “Babylon the Great.” Another is the prospect of deliverance in the very near future into God’s new order. Not only are we interested in these matters, others urgently need to learn about them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It is these subjects that provide the basis for the special issues of the magazines that' we will be giving wide distribution during the month of April. The April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">features the thrilling subject, “Mankind’s Deliverance into God’s New Order.” And the April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is on the theme, “Where Is Religion Leading Mankind?” Don’t you agree that this is information that people everywhere urgently need? Will you have enough copies for distribution?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Why not set a personal goal as to the number of these special issues you want to distribute. Be sure that you have ordered an ample supply. If you have not yet done so, may we suggest that you do it now. Then look to Jehovah to bless your efforts to make full use of these instruments to make known Uis will.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font11">• What are some of the things that the attendant at Kingdom Hall meetings can do to be of service to the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Generally, attendants are alert to aid latecomers to find seats, and they may make note of the attendance. It is a fine thing when they also make it a point to get acquainted with newcomers and then introduce them to some of the servants, as well as to other publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The ventilation of the Kingdom^. Hall is essential if all are to be comfortable. It is appreciated when the attendant is alert to see that it is not too hot or too cold in the hall and that the air is not stuffy. This may require some attention well before the meeting begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Maintaining order during the meetings is essential, and the attendant can do much to help with this. Where children become unruly, the attendant ought to ask the parent in a kindly way to take the child out so the audience will not be unduly distracted. Even before the meeting, parents with young children can be encouraged to sit where they will cause the least distraction if it is necessary to take the children out to discipline them or to care for other needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since the conduct of children inside, as well as outside, the Kingdom Hall can reflect favorably or unfavorably on the congregation, the attendant can, where necessary, remind parents to give proper supervision, not letting the children run there. This often needs to be done during the period when those in attendance are visiting with one another after the meeting is dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The services performed by the attendant obviously can contribute much to everyone’s enjoyment of the meetings. Where possible, it is desirable to use as attendants those who are fine representatives of the congregation and who themselves have had experience in handling situations that arise in family life.—1 Tim. 3:8-10, 12, 13.</span></p>

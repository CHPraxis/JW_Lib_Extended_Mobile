<p><span class="font10">It has been a real joy for us here at the Brooklyn printing plant to work on the 7973 Yearbook. It brings us special pleasure because we know that you will greatly enjoy reading it and that it will do much good in helping persons with whom you are studying the Bible. Here in Brooklyn we are printing 952,500 copies of the English edition, and should you need more copies we will be glad to print an additional supply. We are also printing the Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French editions, totaling 442,600. Germany is printing 152,000 Yearbooks in German and 35,000 in Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first part of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbookgives</span><span class="font10"> you an armchair tour of the progress of the Kingdom work in many parts of the world. Also delightful are the extended reports on five different countries. For example, the report from the British Isles will give you a real eye-opener as to the tremendous amount of work done in preaching the good news even in the early days of the Kingdom work there. And when you read about Ghana, you will be encouraged by the fearlessness on the part of our brothers in standing up for the truth in the face of opposition. The report from Japan will give you a picture of the careful organizing that has been involved in getting the good news of the Kingdom to every part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brother Knorr, recently returned from a visit to Guatemala and Mexico, where he helped on arrangements for next year’s international assemblies there. You will be happy to know that work will soon begin on the building of a new branch building in Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We are on the move forward I Jesus foretold that “this good news of the kingdom” would be preached In all the inhabited earth for a witness, and that is what is now l&gt;eing accomplished. In over 200 lands Jehovah has his Christian witnesses. It is true that the Devil has instigated vicious persecution against them. Scores of nations have tried to stop the preaching work. But this only accomplishes God’s will, the separating of people of all nations. Nothing In heaven or on earth can thwart the purpose of God. And, just thiuk, we are privileged to have a share in it by serving with His organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How do we know what God’s will is? By studying the Bible with the help of God’s spirit and His theocratic organization. Yet most persons have never read much of the Bible, and the majority who have a Bible do not read it with understanding. One reason is the seventeenth-century language of some older translations. Appropriately, then, during December in the field service we will offer the easy-to-read, modern-language </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> Reading this Bible has helped literally hundreds of thousands of persons to take in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">practical to have the relief work cared for right there in Africa, as It would take a long time to ship clothing and other things from here to that part of the world. A report from the brothers in Zambia early in November tells that they have been able to ship in to the brothers from Malawi who are now at the Simla Misale camp over forty tons of supplies, including tarpaulins, blankets, clothing, food and other things that were supplied by the brothers in Zambia and South Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

Fifty students reported on November 5, and accurate knowledge of Jehovah and Christ Jesus and to move forward in God’s service, with eternal life in view. Remember, for those who desire it, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font10">is also available in large print for $5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Of course, many persons today do not believe that the Bible really is God’s Word. In fact, it is commonly believed that such accounts in the Bible as Adam's sin and the Noachian flood are myths. But we know better. Why, the very reason for Jesus’ giving his life Is because Adam </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font10"> sin. (Matt. 20:28) And, as for the Flood, Jesus and his apostle Peter referred to it as being just as real as the end of this present system of things. (Matt. 24: 37-39; 2 Pet. 3:5-7) People need to know that. So, along with the Bible, it is appropriate that we offer the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God?</span><span class="font10"> And if the householder does not take the Bible, we can offer just the 25-cent book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* At times we find people who say they accept the Bible but are not interested in studying the Bible with the aid of some other book. In such a case, why not endeavor </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font10">a total of about seventy-five were scheduled to begin school at the other three school locations in this country. The course is a new one, completely revised to bring it into line with the organizational changes that have taken place and with the needs of the congregations and the field. The new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry School Course</span><span class="font10"> is written In outline style with large print. The students here are enthusiastic about the new course and appreciate the pleasant pace at which it proceeds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">is a variety of abilities that persons in each congregation have, so no one should feel that what he does is not needed or is not worth while. The Bible appropriately likens the congregation to a human body, all the members of which are vital. (1 Cor. 12:19-26) So, the important thing is not that we be able to do what others do, but rather that we use whatever capabilities we do have in Jehovah’s service. At the same time, take note of the fine qualities your fellow workers have. Let them know that you appreciate their love, their willingness, their endurance. Thank Jehovah, too, for the privilege of serving alongside these who are precious in His eyes. Thus, we will be drawn ever closer together, and we will continue to move forward unitedly toward God’s new order, which is now O so very near!</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Can You Share More Fully in Kingdom-preaching?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font11">S DEVOTED servants of Jehovah God we should view people of the world with pity and compassion. That is what our Exemplar Jesus Christ did. When observing crowds of Israelites who were “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd,” “he felt pity for them.”—Matt. 9:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Similarly, the inner feelings of the apostle Paul were stirred toward fellow Israelites who persisted in unbelief. “I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart,” wrote Paul to the Romans. “For I could wish that I myself were separated as the cursed one from the Christ in behalf of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh.&quot; —Rom. 9:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are you, like Paul, deeply concerned about the people in your territory? Does it pain you to see that most of them, by disregarding God’s Word, are endangering their future life prospects and even now harming themselves physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually? Are you moved to do everything you possibly can to aid them to gain an accurate knowledge of the truth? Does the needy spiritual condition of fellow humans prompt you to seek ways to share more fully in Kingdom-preaching?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Consider Your Circumstances</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Because of their deep love for Jehovah and for their fellowmen, many have expanded their participation in Kingdom-preaching by taking up the regular or temporary pioneer service. Have you thought about the possibility of doing so yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many dedicated servants of Jehovah God would very much like to pioneer. But their circumstances simply do not permit them to do so. And, of course, Jehovah God does not require that his people spend all their waking hours in work. Rest and refreshment are definitely needed. That is why Jesus Christ on one occasion said to his disciples: “Come, you yourselves, privately into a lonely place and rest up a bit.”—Mark 6:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nevertheless, we do well to consider how we are spending our time and the possibility of enlarging our share in Kingdom-preaching. Our prayer, like that of Moses, should be: “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.” (Ps. 90:12) Yes, we should want Jehovah God to help us to value, estimate and appraise our days so as to use them in the best way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All of us should ask ourselves: Does the way I use my time show that I firmly believe that we are living in the “final part” of the “last days” and that every reasonable effort should be made to reach honest-hearted ones before it is too late? (Mic. 4:1) Should I adjust my view of material things so that I can be content with less? Could I reduce the number of hours I spend in secular work so as to share more fully in preaching the good news, possibly as a pioneer? Am I using up more time in entertainment and relaxation than I should? How much of this time could I spend more beneficially in the vital work of Kingdom-preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After prayerfully considering your circumstances, you may find that, with some adjustments, you could enroll as a regular or, at least, a temporary pioneer. Should that be the case, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">set a date for yourself </span><span class="font11">as to when you might start, and work toward that goal, looking to Jehovah to bless your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother in Hawaii who was encouraged to do this by a traveling overseer writes: “My question was, When should I start pioneering and resign from my civil service job? One thing I knew—the longer I stayed with my secular job, the harder it would be for me to quit due to increased benefits and pay. I set a goal in my mind to resign from my job and enter the pioneer work on October 1,1966. How quickly that date rolled around and before I knew it I was in the pioneer work.” Today this brother is serving as a special pioneer.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Drain Encouragement from the</span><br><br><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Example of Others</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">After considering the possibility of your becoming a pioneer, you may wonder whether you would be able to continue as such. The example of others can in that case prove to be both helpful and encouraging to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Think about pioneers who have served faithfully for many years. As you hear or read their experiences in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> reflect on the joys they have had and continue to have. Consider their circumstances and why they have been able to make the best of them. If you know pioneers whose circumstances are not too different from your own, talk to them about how they got started and what has enabled them to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The circuit overseer will also be happy to answer your questions about pioneering. And he is certainly in a fine position to do so. From experience he knows what it means to pioneer. He has also worked with many pioneel's, likely including some who, before pioneering, had reservations very similar to yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The elders in your congregation, whether they are pioneers or not, can aid you. Usually being married men with children, they have had to balance family and congregational responsibilities in order to take a zealous lead in Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking. By talking to them, you may be able to see how some of the things they have done to care for their responsibilities could help you to arrange your affairs to pioneer. Moreover, elders are able to provide suggestions based on experience in working with pioneers or even their own experience as temporary pioneers. So do not hesitate to speak to them about any problems you feel could hinder you from doing well in the pioneer work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>When Elders and Ministerial Servants</span><br><br><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Choose Pioneering</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, not all elders and ministerial servants are able to pioneer. But when those who are able to pioneer do enter the regular or temporary pioneer work themselves, this serves as an added encouragement to all in the congregation to exert themselves vigorously in Kingdom-preaching. That is why elders and ministerial servants should be concerned that their words and actions in no way minimize the importance of exerting ourselves to get the witness work accomplished during the “final part” of the “last days.” Manifestly they would not be able to encourage others to have a fuller share in the Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking work if they were not making the best use of their own circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The effect of a good example set by elders and ministerial servants is well illustrated by what happened in recent years in one congregation in Portugal. The brothers serving on the committee were concerned that few took up the pioneer ministry. Even during months of special activity rarely did any brothers or sisters apply for temporary pioneer service. The committee talked the matter over and decided that the best results would probably be obtained by their setting an example as temporary pioneers themselves during the month of April. This they did, even though not one of them had a vacation period. They worked out a schedule for evenings and weekends that allowed them to meet the hour requirement, even though the ban on the work in Portugal makes this harder to achieve. Last year they were delighted when several publishers imitated their example and served as temporary pioneers. This year all those serving in the congregation in an appointed capacity took up temporary pioneer service during April. This really stirred the congregation to activity. About one fourth of the publishers were moved to participate in the temporary pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Similarly, when all serving in appointed capacities in the Ikot Eyo Congregation of Nigeria, Africa, took the lead in the pioneer ministry, forty-one of the fifty-nine baptized publishers enrolled as temporary pioneers. As a result the congregation attained a new peak in publishers. Also the Bible study work showed marked improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the reasons for the large number of pioneers in Japan—one out of every four publishers—is the outstanding example set by elders, many of whom are pioneers. A number of these elders, being in position to do so, have relinquished good jobs to pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One gave up a high position at the Hitachi Electrical Works in order to make time to pioneer. The supervisor of a section of a car manufacturing plant gave up his remunerative job in order to serve as a pioneer. An elder in the Kyoto Ukyo Congregation had been trained in the United States for a high position in the architectural department of his firm. But he gave up this opportunity in order to serve as a pioneer with part-time secular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An elder who entered the regular pioneer work in Hawaii relates the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Being a presiding overseer and trying to help others to become pioneers, I often thought about the importance of taking the lead myself in the pioneer work. Careful planning of my finances indicated that it was possible. My decision was further prompted by a desire to help more to pioneer and aid the people in the community to learn the truth. Having four children who were growing up, I was deeply concerned with their future. I had a good paying job as a crane operator. In June of 1967 I made the decision to give up this job and join my wife in the pioneer work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Has Jehovah blessed this father and his family since his entering the pioneer work? The results speak for themselves. In the congregation where they are serving, about one out of every seven associated is a regular or a special pioneer. Meeting attendance stands at about 150 percent of the number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Regarding his own family blessings, this brother remarks: “My youngest child will be a senior in September and will become a regular pioneer when school begins. This will make six pioneers in our family, including our oldest daughter, who pioneers with her husband in another congregation. With the whole family putting Kingdom interests first in our lives, it serves as a protection and brings great joy to us.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Parents Can Provide Fine Encouragement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">As the example of elders and ministerial servants has a real impact on the congregation, so the example of parents in making good use of their opportunities to declare the “good news” has a wholesome effect on their children. When the emphasis in the home is, not on material things, but on spiritual matters, this does much to build up a burning desire in children to advance Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Commenting on the effect of the good attitude manifested by parents toward pioneering, an elder in Nigeria says: “Parents have deep respect for pioneers, particularly special pioneers and circuit overseers. This has resulted in many young ones developing a similar respect for the pioneer service, which they have come to view as a most desirable work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit overseer in the same country reports a typical example of a family effort to promote pioneering within the family: “A fifteen-year-old sister said at the Itire circuit assembly that her parents consider her pioneering as part of the family’s responsibilities. In drawing up the family’s schedule of activities, they include her activity.” Were she to fail to meet the pioneer requirements, this young sister would view that as failing the family. “Hence,” she says, “there is every encouragement for me to measure up to the pioneer requirements.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Philippines similar family efforts have been put forth. Though having little themselves, and often with large families, many parents there are willing to have their children assist at home and pioneer rather than have them get a full-time job to help carry the financial burden of the family. One young pioneer sister from Quezon City writes: “I come from a large family of nine children but my parents prefer to have me be a pioneer. In order to help them I work in the home—washing and ironing clothes, cooking meals and sewing dresses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the same country a husband and wife have been serving as special pioneers for more than fifteen years while raising a family of nine children. Not all families could do that, but this household found that family cooperation made it possible for them. The father remarks: “We taught our children how to work while they were still young. My oldest son was able to care for our farmland with the help of his sisters. Our daughters learned how to support themselves as market vendors. We also helped them to appreciate the pioneer work so' that today five of my daughters are working as regular pioneers and my youngest son has served as a temporary pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This brother and sister saw good results not only in their family but also in their preaching and disciple-making activities. They have been instrumental in the formation of one new congregation and in helping six other congregations to make progress. They have been able to aid thirty-five sheeplike persons to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are a parent, are you, by word and example, encouraging your children to pioneer? If you are a youth, are you responding appreciatively to the encouragement being given you? Is it your desire to add to the joy of your parents by exerting yourself in the pioneer ministry? Has your love for Jehovah and for fellow humans grown to the point where you want to spend as much time as possible in Kingdompreaching?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Seize the Opportunities Open to You</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">Regardless of your present circumstances, always consider how you might be able to expand your future share in Kingdompreaching. As long as your circumstances can change on this side of the “great tribulation,” look at pioneering as a possible goal. Then, if circumstances do change, freeing you to be a regular or a temporary pioneer, you will be prepared in mind and heart to make the best use of the opportunities before you. Many brothers and sisters have done just that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One brother in Portugal had the opportunity to sell his share in a business partnership and become a pioneer. He seized the opportunity and invested his money in ways that guaranteed a regular income sufficient to care for his family of two children as well as his mother and thus entered pioneer service. He has not regretted that decision. He writes: “I always had much to do as a businessman. But as a pioneer I am even busier. In contrast, though, I am unquestionably much happier and healthier. When working as a businessman, I came home many times completely exhausted mentally, worn out and irritable. My nerves were bad and I took tranquilizers. Now that I am a pioneer, I come home very tired physically some days, but truly happy and content mentally. Why, since becoming a pioneer, I have never taken another tranquilizer! It is true that we now live a more modest life, but the life we live is so much richer. And spiritually speaking, well, there is just no comparison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even this brother’s twelve-year-old daughter has noticed the difference. She says: “Before when Daddy would come home from work late and tired, we hardly saw him. He would just eat and go to bed without speaking hardly a word to us. Now, Daddy spends more time with us and we really like that. Most of all, we enjoy the family Bible study Daddy regularly has with us now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As in many other parts of the world, brothers and sisters in Korea have also done well in taking advantage of opportunities to be regular or temporary pioneers. In that land 1,810 of the 14,754 proclaimers of the “good news” are pioneers; that is one out of every eight. They do not allow themselves to be discouraged by the bitterly cold winters. Instead, the cold month of January usually sees a peak in the number of temporary pioneers. Why? Because most of the classrooms are unheated and so schools are closed due to the severe cold weather, freeing schoolchildren and teachers for the temporary pioneer work. Having the help of older children at home, housewives are also given opportunity to increase their preaching activity as temporary pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you make similar use of your opportunities? If you have a vacation in December or January, could you make plans to pioneer then? If on school vacation, could you assist your mother with some of the work at home and thus possibly open the way for her to share with you in the temporary pioneer work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Certainly as all of us keep mindful of increasing our share in Kingdom-preaching because of our love for Jehovah and fellowmen, much will yet be accomplished in aiding honest-hearted ones to take their stand for true worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Did you notice that the Theocratic Ministry School program for 1973 features something new? With i the exception of times when written reviews are scheduled, each week there will be a talk based on Biblical or modern-day </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">life experiences. </span><span class="font10">Will it not be encouraging to hear how others overcame problems similar to ours and continued to find delight in Jehovah’s service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If you are scheduled to give one of these new talks, try to capture the spirit of the experience, make it live and show how we personally can benefit from it. You do not have to use every detail of the experience, but focus attention primarily on points that develop the assigned theme. While it is not required in each case, you may wish to build the presentation involving a modern-day experience around an appropriate scripture. In relating such experiences be alert and watch for opportunities to involve your assistant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As you recall from the schedule for 1972, tlie Bible reading assignments were shorter than previously. Many brothers took advantage of this to develop meaningful introductions and conclusions that really highlighted the value of the material. And opportunities were utilized to make explanatory comments during the course of their reading. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> This coming year the reading</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">assignments will again be comparatively short. So, we encourage you to make good use of the available time to present helpful clarifying information or to show how the scriptures being &nbsp;read personally</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Continued fine efforts were put forth in the field ministry during September to search out interested ones by the house-to-house ministry and to help sheeplike ones to learn the truth by means of regular Bible studies. Isn’t it encouraging to know that 5,770,237 hours were spent In various features of the field ministry and that well over 8 million Bibles, books, booklets and magazines were placed with the public!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The total of 421,149 proclalmers of the good news is an increase of 12,804 over last September, when 408,345 reported field service activity.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Those of you who are younger in years can also make your assignments more meaningful by doing research. Talk to your parents or the school overseer to get suggestions on how scriptures can be explained briefly. Then when giving your talks, make practical application of scriptures used, doing so in your own words. But, of course, be careful not to make it appear that you are counseling older, experienced ones in the audience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The school overseer and other elders who may give counsel can also contribute much in helping us to get the most benefit from the School. Counsel on speech qualities can be beneficial, but it does not always have to be extensive. A few well-chosen remarks on the application of suggestions on speech counsel in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font10">may suffice. Of course, where necessary, private counsel can always be given on points the student may</span></p></li></ul>

Subscriptions for both </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> may be offered, with two of the older bound books, for $3.00. Reimbursement of indiviaual publishers and of congregations for such books given free with new subscriptions will be handled in the same manner as during October. The Society still has on hand a sizable stock of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth.”</span><span class="font9"> There is a more limited supply of You </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</span><span class="font9"> and “Your Will </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Be Done on Earth.”</span><span class="font9"> Congregations may order these. We encourage you to use such books as premiums witn new subscriptions until all of them are in the hands of the public. Then we will again give a premium of three booklets. ♦ The January 1 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> with which we will begin our 1973 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription campaign, contains especially fine material on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ and how it should affect us today.

Now is the time to place your order for extra copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ In correspondence to the Society regarding congregation matters, please be certain that the name of the city and the congregation name are shown. In this regard, please see page 86 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font9"> and page 147 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It is requested that, during December, the elders review the situation of any pioneers in the congregation and send reports to the Society in those cases specified on the Personal Qualifications Report (Form S-326). Order number needed. See what is stated on </span><span class="font10">beneficially work on for improvement. It is not necessary in each case to announce whether a certain point is being marked “G,” “I” or “\V.” The school overseer may frequently find it more beneficial to use most of the two minutes allotted to him after each student talk to direct attention to some outstanding point from the material assigned for use in the talk itself. By drawing attention to its practical value, it will be more deeply impressed on the audience. So, when preparing for the School, he may find it helpful to pick out from each assignment one point that will be particularly beneficial to the audience</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Opportunities</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many congregations in the United States have territory that does not get worked at least once each year. Generally such territory is rural and requires considerable travel to work. This past summer a number of pioneers and publishers assisted In covering such unworked congregation territory during their vacation, or on the way to or returning from an'assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> While you may not be able to spend two or three months working in nnassigned territory, as some do, you may be able to spend a few days or possibly a week or more of your vacation next summer helping a congregation to cover some of its unworked territories.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If you want to assist in covering unworked congregation territory next summer, why not begin making plans now?

The things that Jesus taught originated with his Father. [Read John 8:28, 29.] So, Jesus himself is not God, is he? But Jesus helps us to know God and His purpose for us. Jesus shows how God makes it possible for us to find satisfaction in living now. He also shows that, very soon, God is going to clean wickedness out of this earth and make it a wonderful place in which to live.

But note what the Bible says here at 2 Peter 3:9. [Read.] So, what does this tell us about God? [Walt for comment.] If we appreciate the reason for his patience, we won’t miss its purpose.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A family of six in Youngstown, Ohio, was able to put a total of almost 700 hours in the field ministry during July. Two daughters served in • Illinois as temporary special pioneers. The father' and mother, regular pioneers, and their other two daughters worked in Kentucky. ♦ Two of five circuit assemblies scheduled for Solomon Islands were attended by a total of 1,471.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Finland branch reports the pouring of concrete for their new extension to the branch building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ In October, brothers in Japan were able to begin printing magazines on their own presses at the new factory in Numazu. The office reported new peaks of 14,525 publishers and 1,987 regular pioneers in September. This is their 62nd successive publisher peak. The increase was 334 publishers over August, one of the biggest in a single month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">▼ Two district assemblies were held in Kenya branch territory. One at Mombasa was attended by 2,161, with 134 baptized. The other assembly, at Kampala, Uganda, was attended by 728, with 34 baptized from Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Tanzania.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Question</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">• Should the presiding overseer serve as a book study conductor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is something to be worked out by the local body of elders, with consideration for the individual involved. Where possible, book study conductors should be elders, as pointed out on page 81 of the ••Organization” book. Ministerial servants may be used on a substitute basis if there are not enough elders to care for all the book study groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a large congregation where there are more than enough elders to care for all the book study groups, it may not be necessary for the presiding overseer to serve as a book study conductor. However, if there are not enough elders to care for all the groups, it would be beneficial for the presiding overseer to serve as a book study conductor. If he is the only elder regularly attending a certain book study, then, of course, it is to be expected that he will be the study conductor. When he visits the other book study groups once or twice a year, depending on the needs of the individual groups, the one serving as his assistant can take care of the book study in his absence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It should not be necessary for the presiding overseer to spend extended periods of time visiting groups that nave elders as conductors, since the elders should be well qualified as teachers and otherwise be able to care properly for the needs of the group. However, in certain cases it may be advisable to spend several weeks visiting groups where ministerial servants are conducting the study on a substitute basis, in harmony with what Is stated on page 71, paragraph 2, of the &quot;Organization” book.</span></p>

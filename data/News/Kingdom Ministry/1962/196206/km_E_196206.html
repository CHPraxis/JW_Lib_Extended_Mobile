<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Joy in New World Associations</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a happy time it will be when this old world is gone and we can forever enjoy New World associations! But why wait? Now is the time to start enjoying the fellowship of those who are living by New World standards. Now is the time for us to meet together, study together and work together to bring praise to Jehovah and to aid others to find joy in New’ World associations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During June we have a particularly joyful work to do, one that we are going to enjoy doing together. In nearly all the Englishspeaking world we will be offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font10"> along with a booklet, for only $1. There are so many opportunities to place it. Principally, of course, we will be offering it from door to door. In addition, there are those with -whom we conduct studies and the persons who have obtained </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscriptions and copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font10">book, many of whom, being acquainted with the new Bible through the publications they already have, will be anxious to get a copy. Then, too, last December some publishers were averaging more than one Bible every day of the month by offering it to neighbors, relatives, workmates, salesmen—yes, everyone they met. The possibilities are almost unlimited; make use of them all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The new sermon will help us to impress people with the importance of reading the Bible and the advantage of reading it in modern-day English. You will find the sermon simple, appealing and to the point. In addition to studying it together at the service meeting and reviewing it at your service center the following Sunday morning, rehearse it at home—if possible, with other members of the family or with your service companion. Preparation will make your delivery effective right from the start. For those who need a briefer presentation there are suggestions under “Presenting the Good News,” and, of course, all of us should be ready to use such a brief presentation -when the householder is too busy to listen to the full sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> You will find placing the Bible easy if you have specific texts ready to show the householder to demonstrate its clarity of rendering. With this in mind, you may want to carry with you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">of October 15, 1961, with its chart of comparative renderings. It will also be helpful to review these at the service center on a Sunday morning early in the month. We have a priceless treasure in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New Wo, Id Trati slation</span><span class="font10"> and we are going to enjoy sharing it, with others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Excellent</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Yes, the report for April was excellent. You will be as pleased as we were, brothers, to see how Jehovah has blessed our efforts with an all-time peak of 286,908 publishers. This is 13,777 more publishers than any other month to date. It is encouraging to see we achieved a 15.4-porcent increase, and equally as gratifying is to see that publishers averaged 10.2 hours!</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR JUNE</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“New World Translation of the Holy ’ Scriptures,” and a booklet, for $1. z</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark3"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR JUNE</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4 The Joy Found in New World (</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark4"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associations.—Ps. 122:1.</span></a></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Our use of the special magazines and fine efforts also had blessed results. There were 5,002,888 magazines placed during the month of April. And from January through April 475,016 subscriptions for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> were obtained, the greatest number yet during any campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Of course, our goal is to do more than place Bibles; it is to help persons of goodwill to understand them. So we need to be alert to start studies wherever possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> As we know, to get the best results in the service and so enjoy it to the full we must spend time in it regularly. And what is our goal? Ten hours for each congregation publisher. Are you personally reaching that quota each and every month? Have you actually sat down and worked out a practical schedule that will enable you to do so? If not, do it now. By keeping our work well organized we are able to accomplish the most in aiding others to find joy in New World associations now, and that to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">April Report</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Another excellent feature of the report is the Memorial attendance. There were 474,196 who attended this year, whereas last year we had 451,356, an increase of 22,840. This is thrilling because it demonstrates the potential for growth before us. What a blessed privilege and responsibility we have to help these many thousands to gain an accurate knowledge of the truth and to bring them on to Christian maturity! (Heb. 6:1) And one more happy thought: we had 10,821 ministers in the pioneer field—the highest number' to date, surpassing the previous high of August, 1959. See April Service Report, page 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> As we pause to reflect on the blessings received during the special April campaign, what do we see? The pleasant prospects of a wonderful expansion work in the months to come. April saw many persons in the witness work for the first time. It is our responsibility to keep on helping these “to work at good, to be rich in fine works.”—1 Tim. 6 : IS.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: The Joy Found in New World Associations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Talk on “The Joy Found in New World Associations.’’ (See “Watchtower,” May 15, 1961, pp. 296307, and June 1, 1962, p. 349.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article, “Joy in New World Associations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font0"> min: Sermon: “God’s Word, an Inspired Guide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Each one of us will want to offer the Bible enthusiastically to all we meet in June. It is satisfying to place the “New World Translation” with people, because we know that it contains the w’ord of life and in language that everyone can understand. The sermon is simple and to the point; it. should be easy for everyone to use. (See “Sermon Outlines,” Section 3A, “Bible.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) With sermon prominently outlined for all to see, chairman conducts lively and informative discussion of introduction, scriptures, transitions and presentation of Bible. Emphasize key points and logical development of sermon. Capable publishers should be assigned in advance to prepare points to suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: God’s Word, an Inspired Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bible inspired, helps us to meet problems of life with success</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">—2 Tim, 3:16, 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gives us hope for the future (Paraphrase Rom. 15:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Shows that Kingdom will soon bring peace, security right here on earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">—Mic. 4:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Taking in of such knowledge means life &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 17:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suggested introduction and transitions: “In these days when there are delinquency and insecurity all around us, you have no doubt asked: What does the future hold for us? Where can we find a reliable guide to help us cope with the problems of life? The best place to go is the Bible, and this scripture shows why. [Read 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.3 So it is right in the Bible that we find guidance inspired by God, which is what we need to ‘set things straight’ in our own Jives. It also gives us hope for the future, as pointed out at Romans 15:4, where it shows that these things were written for our instruction, that we might have hope. And what is the hope that it gives us? See what it says at Micah 4:3, 4. [Read it.] Only God by means of his kingdom can do that, and the Bible shows us that he will and that these things will come to pass right here on earth. Knowledge of that sort is vital to each one of us, as John 17:3 shows. [Read it.] For that reason each one of us needs to read the Bible, but read it with understanding. No doubt, you have often said, ‘I wish the Bible were easier to understand.’ Well, it is easier to understand when you read it in the living language of our day. It is just such a modernlanguage Bible I have been using here, and it was not a bit difficult to understand, was it? [May want to use other examples of clear rendering. See ‘Sermon Outlines,’ 57B; also chart in October 15, 1961, ‘Watchtower.’] A copy of this Bible is yours, with this Bible-study aid, for just $1.” After placement is made, offer to demonstrate for householder how to use the booklet and Bible together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (8 min.) Well-rehearsed presentation of sermon to emphasize its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) For each publisher to share effectively in Bible distribution during June, review and rehearse sermon at home immediately. Parents should aid children to learn it (or one of the briefer presentations). Endeavor to start Bible studies on initial calls wherever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8 min: Concluding comments. Cover April report. (Include remarks on the slogan, based on 2 Peter 1:19, at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Talk on “District Assemblies in 1962.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Are You Conducting Productive Studies?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —demonstrate points and in a talk covei* experiences in placing the “New World Translation.” (See “Watchtower,” June 1, 1962, p. 350.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: Talk by assistant congregation servant encouraging all to make ten-hour quota a goal that they personally meet each month. Discuss local problems. Need personal schedule, but do not make it so tight it will not work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">20 min: Demonstration: Youthful Ministers Wisely Use Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2 min.) Chairman discusses the importance of using time wisely, theocratically. Real security is in remembering and serving Jehovah.—Ecel. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE I (3 min.) Two youths discuss plans for the summer. One, still of school age, tells that he is going to do just as little as possible on his vacation—just a little hiking, fishing, but mostly loafing. The other has just graduated and tells of his big plans for a lucrative job. Neither plans to pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) While some relaxation is good for one and a young person who has finished school usually must give some thought to secular work with which to support himself, there is other more important activity that should dominate one’s thinking. Parents can do much to inculcate spiritual aspirations for the pioneer ministry in youths and should do all they<sup>7</sup> possibly can to this end. How much better it would be to hear remarks such as these from youths . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE II (4 min.) Two different but theocratically-minded youths discuss plans for the summer. One, still of school age, has already scheduled vacation pioneering and awaits receipt of his appointment. He is elated over prospects of working with the other one, who has graduated and has just received his appointment for regular pioneer service. Both talk about the future and hope to increase their privileges of service as special pioneers, missionaries, in Bethel service, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Both are thankful for aid from parents and opportunities they have to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6 min.) Chairman commends such thinking and planning. Then calls back first two youths and encourages them to consider seriously the course being pursued by the two theocratically-minded youths who have arranged to pioneer. The youth still of school age expresses sorrow he did not plan to vacation pioneer and wishes it was not too late to apply. Chairman tells him it is not too late, hands him the vacation pioneer application blank and suggests he fill it out right away. The other is encouraged to view his future theocratically. Is he really storing up treasures in heaven? (Matt. 6:19-21) Why not get a part-time job and pioneer? Expresses appreciation for counsel, asks about requirements for enrollment. Is thankful for suggestions and will make plans to vacation pioneer until he carl qualify to be enrolled as a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2 min.) Chairman encourages youths to make wise use of summer months and to plan their future wisely. Parents arc encouraged to cultivate pioneer spirit in their children. Best way for parents to do this is to be an example by vacation pioneering with children. If they have graduated from school, youths should give serious consideration now to plans to pursue a career as a pioneer. Use time wisely as vacation or regular pioneers.—Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Concluding comments. Include local experiences in placing the Bible. Comment on the slogan at bottom of page 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Experiences related by local publishers on how they personally came to an appreciation of the importance of baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Congregation Organization” article on “Helping New Ones to Dedication and Baptism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">20 min: Talk and demonstration of points in article “Avoid Unprofitable Questions.” (See “Watchtower,” June 15, 1962.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Congregations having a fifth service meeting will arrange their own program, taking into consideration counsel offered by the circuit servant on his latest visit.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>JZP't&amp;g'wMiMa</span><span class="font8"> SPEECH TRAINING]</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">i This is the first of six installments of material especially designed to aid you to make the greatest possible progress in your training in the Theocratic Ministry School. It will enable you to know just how to acquire the characteristics that mark an effective speaker and teacher. It will also make it possible for those who offer counsel to be most helpful in contributing to that advancement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 Each one of the points listed on your Speech Counsel slip will be discussed separately in this series of articles. Rather than consider all the points under “Preparation” before handling any of the counsel on “Teaching” and “Speaking,” we will take up points of counsel under each of these headings early in the series. In that way you will have available as soon as possible the material you need for use in the school. (In these articles “P” is used to refer to the heading “Preparation,” “T” to “Teaching,” and “S” to “Speaking.” The number that follows the letter, as with Pl, corresponds with the numbering under that heading on your Speech Counsel slip.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 You will find that, to use this material to the best advantage, you will want to follow these steps in preparing your talks, doing so in this order: (1) Reread the articles in this series dealing with the speech qualities next in line for consideration on your Speech Counsel slip. (2) Read or gather the material to be presented. (3) Decide on the purpose of the talk and determine the type of person or audience to whom it will be presented. (4) Organize and outline the material, keeping in mind your audience and the purpose of your talk and considering how these govern the way in which you will apply the points on which you are to be counseled. If you follow these four steps in order, each talk you give, regardless of the experience you have had in the past, should reflect improvement in your speaking and teaching ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 To simplify the matter for you, the articles in this series will generally break down each of the points on the Speech Counsel slip into several aspects, designating them “a,” “b,” “c,” and so forth. These pinpoint the factors to consider in determining whether you have mastered that particular point on the counsel slip. With this help there should never be any doubt as to what is meant by any point on the Speech Counsel slip or how to carry it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 New speakers are not expected to ■work on every aspect discussed in these articles in connection with a point of counsel. Give attention to the first one (designated “a”), or possibly two (“a” and “b”), and reserve the others for the next coverage of the counsel slip. However, advanced students should endeavor to employ every applicable aspect of each quality in line for counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6 The school servant, for his part, will find this material invaluable in giving counsel. Reference to the list of factors involved in each point of counsel (found in the first paragraph of each article) will enable him to put his finger on the counsel that will do the most good. Not only will he be able to tell the speaker that he did well on a certain point on his counsel slip, but he will be able to tell him what made it good. And if he suggests that the student work on the point another time, he will be able to tell him just how to go about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 Of course, after counsel has been given, the student who has a keen desire to advance is going to apply</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PI. Informative Material</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">io a. Specific; b. to your audience; c. practical value; d. accuracy of statement; e. additional clarifying material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">n This quality of speech involves what you say; it also involves your choice of what you say. To be enlightening and upbuilding, the ideas conveyed through informative speech should make God’s Word understandable and help us conform to God’s requirements. Thus, many facts and details may and should be included in a talk, but they should magnify Jehovah’s purpose, not the knowledge or background of the speaker. Too, if questions remain in the minds of the audience, something has been omitted. A proper choice of material has not been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">12 New and very young students may be watched for this quality to be manifested in the introduction and conclusion of a reading assignment, not in order to mark their counsel slips, but as an indication that they are ready to prepare another type of talk and then receive counsel on this point.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. Specific</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">is A talk dealing in generalities lacks weight and authority. It is vague. It leaves the audience uncertain. If ideas are to be remembered they must be specific, exact. This gives evidence of research and knowledge of the subject. It gives the audience confidence in the accuracy of the material being presented. A precisej exact speaker does not beat the air. His words are packed with specific facts. This all tends to make the speaker a better teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">14 This quality can be acquired in preparation by asking, Why? When? Where? etc. It is usually not enough it in his everyday speech as well as in preparation of succeeding talks in the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8 While these articles are designed for the school, they should not be overlooked in preparing and delivering any talk, whether for a service meeting, a public meeting, a door-to-door sermon or any other. Thus a brother giving exhortation at a service meeting would do well to reread such articles as “Informative Material,” “Main Points Made to Stand Out,” “Scripture Application Made Clear” and “Warmth, Feeling.” A brother giving a public talk on Bible doctrine would consider articles such as “Convincing Argument,” “Logical, Coherent Development,” “Repetition for Emphasis” and “Audience Helped to Reason,” among others. (These articles will appear later in the series.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9 Both student and school servant should remember that training is progressive. If you pay attention to your teaching, each talk will give evidence of advancement, and that to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to say something happened. Give names of places, dates, perhaps reasons. It is not enough to state certain truths. Show </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font0"> they are true; show why they are of value to know. If giving instruction, explain </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font0"> a thing is to be done. How much development of this kind is essential will be determined by how much an audience already knows. So consider the audience to ascertain what details may be required.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. To “your” audience</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">is What might inform one audience might add nothing to the knowledge of another group, or it might even leave them completely in the dark. Obviously then, the material must suit a particular audience. For instance, in a talk on how our work is conducted, the material would be handled altogether differently at a service meeting than in talking to a person getting ready to dedicate himself, or to a local Chamber of Commerce group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">16 These factors must also be taken into account in the various assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School. The material presented in any assigned talk should be considered as to audience, setting and purpose of the talk. These factors will be determined by the type of talk and the setting the speaker has arranged. Of course, the instruction talk will be a talk to the congregation. The regular platform talks and readings assigned to brothers as students will also be delivered to the congregation, but with persons of goodwill in mind, as at a public talk. Other talks may vary, the audience and purpose being identified by the setting. In all cases, both student and counselor can ask themselves, Is the material adapted to the particular audience involved in the presentation? Will the audience be informed and instructed by it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">it In preparation ask yourself, What do I want to accomplish in this talk? How much of what I want to say does this person or group already know? What foundation must I lay before these points can be made clear? How would I say it differently to an altogether different group? Comparisons often clarify our viewpoints. Try different approaches to different groups in your preparation just to get the feel of the difference in considering the audience and making the material informative to the particular audience you are going to address.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">c. Practical value</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">is There is much to be learned, but not all of it is practical. To us, informative material concerns those things we need to know for Christian living, for our ministry. We want, to know how to use this information that we have acquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">19 The student in preparation and the school servant in counseling might consider this point by asking, What guiding principles are to be found in the talk? Could the material be used in making decisions? Can the information presented be adapted to the field ministry? Does it magnify God’s Word and point to his purpose? Few talks can contribute all this information, but to be practical, material presented should be usable in some way by the audience.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">d. Accuracy of statement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">20 Jehovah’s witnesses are an organization of truth. We should want to speak the truth and be absolutely accurate in every detail at all times. This should be so not only as regards doctrine but also in our quotations, what we say about others or how we represent them, also in matters involving scientific data or news events. Private interpretations of any such material should be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2i Wrong statements delivered to an audience may be repeated and the error magnified. Inaccuracies that are recognized by an audience raise questions as to the authority of the speaker on other points, perhaps even calling in question the truth of the message itself. A person of goodwill hearing such statements, and having heard a different view expressed on another occasion, might come to the conclusion there is disunity of thought among Jehovah’s witnesses and discontinue association without even revealing his reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">22 The counselor should not pick to pieces every statement made by the student, especially one new in the truth and therefore not fully established in the deeper things of God’s Word. Rather, he will tactfully help to mold the thinking of the student and show him how to improve his accuracy by careful advance preparation, making certain of his facts, consulting the Society’s publications, etc.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">e. Additional clarifying material</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">23 Thoughts presented as a result of meditation or that may be gleaned from further research on a subject can contribute much to a talk and can sometimes avoid an uninstructive repetition of material already familiar to the audience. It adds freshness to the presentation, enlivens the interest of the audience, and can make a very familiar subject truly delightful. Too, it gives confidence to the speaker. He approaches his talk with an enthusiasm born of the knowledge that he has something just a little different to present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">24 Generally, in the school, only if something is needed to clear away misunderstanding, to fill in gaps, should</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pl. Clear, Understandable</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">26 a. Simply stated; b. unfamiliar terms explained; c. not too much material.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">27 This quality of speech involves </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font0"> you say what you have to say, not just during the talk, but primarily as to how it has been considered in preparation of the material.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">28 Much thought may have gone into gathering and organizing the material for a talk, taking into account all the requirements necessary to make the talk informative. Yet, if no attention is given to how the material is to be presented to make it clear and understandable, it may well be of little benefit and not get through to the audience. Of course, many basic qualities of speech are involved in putting your points across, and these will be considered in detail in due time. But, for example, even though logic, coherence and enthusiasm might excel, a talk can still fail to accomplish its purpose if this one basic quality here under discussion is lacking. For best results in coordinating this quality with others to be considered later, both the student and the counselor should view it in this way.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. Simply stated</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">29 This does not mean that phrases need to be thought out in advance. But ideas to be presented must be analyzed and certain definite factors taken into account. This will generally result in a talk that is compact and in expression of thought that is simple, spoken in plain language. A subject that is involved in the mind of the speaker will be involved in presentation. Thoughts will not be clearly defined. Sentence structure will become complicated or the speaker will idly ramble on in pointless repetition until the audience loses the idea before it is fully presented. Advance thought will prevent this disastrous result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">30 Last-minute preparation must be avoided. Each point of the talk must be thought through all the way until it is simple and clear to the speaker. Review of these points in preparation for delivery will so sharpen them in his mind that they will come out readily when called for and will be as sparklingly clear to the audience as to the speaker.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. Unfamiliar terms explained</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">31 Our study of the Scriptures and of the Society’s publications has given additional material be introduced beyond what is assigned as source material. A lack of such additional material in a talk might seldom be considered a weakness, but material properly chosen on the right occasion and used to clarify some point to a particular audience might be a matter for commendation in counsel by the school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">23 A danger to be avoided is private speculation. The Society’s publications should be used and relied upon. Check the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index, </span><span class="font0">cross references and footnotes on the scriptures. Make sure that what you say is clarifying, not misrepresenting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">us a vocabulary of terms quite strange to those unacquainted with our work. If we were to explain the truths of the Bible to some audiences, using such terms as these, either much of what we say would be lost or our speech would be entirely unintelligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">32 Consider your audience. What is the level of their understanding? How much do they know of our work? How many of these expressions will be as readily understood by them as by the speaker? Terms like “theocracy,” “New World society,” “remnant,” even “Armageddon” and “Kingdom,” can convey either a different thought to the hearer’s mind or none at all. Even such terms as “soul,” “hell” and “immortality” need to be clarified if the hearer is unfamiliar with our work. But if the talk is being delivered to the congregation, terms such as these need not be explained. So the setting should be taken into account by the counselor and appropriate counsel given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">c. Not too much material</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">33 A talk may be highly informative, so much so in fact that the great quantity of material floods the audience and understanding is dulled or lost completely. To accomplish the purpose of a talk, no more material should be introduced than can be clearly developed in the allotted time. No more should be expressed than can be reasonably absorbed by the audience. Furthermore, material presented to a stranger or person of goodwill would have to be considerably simplified as compared with material from that same source when presented to the congregation. Here, too, the counselor must take into account the audience being addressed by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">34 How will the student know how much material to put into a talk? Comparison will be an advantage in preparation. Analyze what you have to present. How many of these points will already be known to the audience, at least in part? How many will be completely new? The broader the foundation of knowledge already had the more can be built upon it in a given time. But if practically nothing is known of the subject to be discussed, then great care must be exercised as to how much is going to be said and how long it will take to explain these points to the full comprehension of the audience.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">P3. Main Points Made to Stand Out</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">35 a. Not too many; b. ideas developed separately; c. subpoints focus on main ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">36 if the purpose of a talk is to be accomplished, not only must informative material be presented clearly and understandably, it must be presented in such a way that it will be remembered. This involves focusing the attention on just the essentials of the material. These essentials are the main points of the talk. If they are to be remembered, they must stand out in bold relief from the rest of the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">37 Main points are like shelf labels or signs in grocery stores that help one identify what a section of shelving contains. Under the label CEREALS, jams and jellies would be out of place and only confuse persons. Under the sign COFFEE AND TEA, rice would not belong. If the shelf labels are hidden because of overcrowding or overloading, then it is difficult to find anything. But if the signs remain clearly visible, one can quickly recognize what is before him. So it is with the main points of your talk. As long as they can be perceived and kept in mind, your audience will need very few notes to follow you to your conclusion and carry away the meat of your talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">38 Another factor. Just as the section signs in a grocery store will vary somewhat from country to country, so the selection and use of main points will vary according to the audience and purpose of the talk. For this reason, the school servant should evaluate the student’s choice of main points on the basis of the student’s use of them, not on some arbitrary selection of points the counselor may have made in advance. In other words, even in summarizing printed material, the main points cannot be determined until the purpose of the talk and the audience have been identified, and, ordinarily, this is not known to the counselor until the student delivers the talk. On the other hand, the student must identify in his own mind his purpose and his audience before he selects his main points and arranges his material to make them stand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">39 In making your selection you choose only the essentials. So, you ask, what makes a point essential? It is essential if you cannot accomplish the purpose of your talk without it. For example, in a discussion of the ransom with a person unacquainted with the doctrine, it is vital to establish Jesus’ humanity on earth, otherwise it would be impossible to demonstrate the corresponding quality of his sacrifice. Therefore you would consider this one of the main points of the discussion. But if you had already proved to this person that the trinity was a false conception, then your handling of this point might be only secondary because already accepted. And because of this it would then be comparatively simple to establish the corresponding value of Jesus’ ransom. In that case the consideration of Jesus’ humanity would not be an essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&lt;0 So ask yourself. What does my audience already know? What must I establish to accomplish my purpose? If you know the answer to the first question, you can answer the second by gathering your material, temporarily setting aside all matters that are known and sorting out all the remaining points into the fewest possible groups. These groups become your identifying signs as to what spiritual food you are presenting to the audience. These labels or main points must never become covered up or hidden. They are your main points, which must stand out.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. Not too many</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">41 There are only a few essentials on any subject. In the majority of cases they can be numbered on one hand. This is true regardless of the time you have in which to present them. Do not fall into the common snare of trying to make too many points stand out. When a grocery store gets too big and there are too many categories, one may have to ask for directions. Your audience can reasonably grasp only so many different ideas at one sitting. And the longer your talk, the simpler it must be made and the stronger and more sharply defined your key points must be. So do not try to make your audience remember many things. Select those points that you feel they absolutely must carry away and then spend all your time talking about these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">42 What determines whether there are too many points or not? Simply stated, if any idea could be left out and the purpose of the talk still be accomplished, that point is not a key point. To round out the talk you may decide to include the point as a connective or a reminder, but it should not stand out as prominently as those that could not possibly be omitted. If it does, you will soon have so many labels for your spiritual food that your audience will become confused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">43 Another thing, you must have sufficient time to develop each point successfully, conclusively. If much must be said in a short time, hold the matters known to the audience down to a minimum. Strip away all but the unfamiliar factors and make them so clear that it will be difficult for the audience to forget them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">44 Lastly, your talk must give an</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">M. Sabgect Theme Emfshasased</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">49 a. Appropriate theme; b. theme words or idea repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">so The theme of a talk is the particular aspect from which a given subject is viewed. It must permeate the entire talk. It must serve as the cohesive agent that unites all main points developed. It is the gist of your talk; it could be expressed perhaps in one sentence and yet it would include each phase of the material presented. The theme should be obvious to the audience when the talk is concluded. It will not be if the subject theme has not been emphasized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5i In some instances you may have to gather material before your theme is selected. But the theme must be clearly established before preparation is begun on the outline of the talk or before the main points are selected. For instance, following each home Bible study we discuss the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. That is a broad impression of simplicity. This does not always depend on the amount of material presented. (See P2c.) It may be just the way your points are grouped together. For example, if you were to walk into a store where everything was piled together in the middle of the floor it would look crowded and most confusing. You would have difficulty finding anything. But, when everything is properly arranged and all related items are grouped together and identified by a section sign, the effect is quite pleasing and any one item can be easily located. Make your talk simple by grouping your thoughts under just a few main ideas.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. Ideas developed separately</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">45 Each main thought must stand on its own. Each must be developed separately. This does not prevent a brief outline or summary of the main headings in the introduction or conclusion of your talk. But in the body of the talk you should talk about only one main idea at a time, allowing only such overlapping or regressions as may be needed for connections or emphasis. However, whether these main points are tied together is not the concern of this particular quality of speech. That is a matter of emphasizing the theme. (See P4.) Learning to make a topical outline will greatly aid in determining whether main points are developed separately</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">c. Subpoints focus on main ideas</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">46 Once established, main points should not be overshadowed by secondary thoughts. Points of proof, scriptures, or other material presented should focus attention on the main idea and amplify it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">47 In preparation, analyze all secondary points and keep only what directly contributes to that main point, either to clarify, prove or amplify the point. Anything irrelevant should be drastically cut. It will only confuse the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">48 Any point related to a main idea should be directly connected to that thought by what you say. Do not leave it to the audience to apply. Make the connection clear. Say what the connection is. What is not spoken will generally not be understood. This can be accomplished by repeating key words that express the main thought or by repeating the idea of the main point from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">subject. Almost anything could be said. To decide what you will say on this subject, you must consider your audience and the purpose of your talk. On this basis you will select a theme. If you were trying to start a new person in the service, you might decide to show that Jehovah’s witnesses imitate Jesus Christ by preaching from house to house. That would be your theme. Everything you say would be to develop and establish that phase of the broad subject, Jehovah’s witnesses. Main points would be developed separately and subpoints would focus on their respective key points, but the theme would unite all of them into a coherent whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">52 How can you emphasize a theme in your talk? First, you must select an appropriate theme, one suited to your purpose. This requires advance preparation. Once the theme has been selected and your talk developed around it, it will almost automatically be emphasized if you talk on the outline that you have prepared. However, in actual delivery, the repeating of key words or the central idea in the theme from time to time will more readily insure the theme’s being driven home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a, Appropriate theme</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">53 It will be almost impossible to accomplish your purpose in a talk if your theme is not properly chosen. For this reason, one of the first points that the school servant will consider in analyzing this quality in a student talk is, Was the theme that was selected an appropriate one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">54 This should not be an arbitrary decision on his part, based on his own advance selection. Nor will he base it altogether on the theme that you may have written out and handed to him in advance of the talk. Rather, he will base his counsel on the theme you do actually emphasize, if that be rhe case; and if it is not the same one that you handed him, then he will show you which one would best accomplish your purpose and why your prepared theme was not the one that you emphasized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">55 If no theme is emphasized, then the counselor will determine whether it was because your planned theme was not appropriate to the purpose you were demonstrating or whether it was because you did not employ the proper means to make your theme stand out. In this case he will take into account the subject assigned, chapter titles, subheadings, etc., and whether the material lends itself to the presentation you were making. If the theme is appropriate and the main points of the talk are in harmony with this theme, then it should draw them all together. The only thing left is to present the main points in such a way that they will not hide the theme, but, rather, focus attention on it just as subpoints focus on the main points. —■See P3c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">b. Theme words or idea repeated</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 6 One way that all parts of a talk can be made to highlight the theme is to repeat key words stated in the theme or to repeat the central idea of the theme. In music, a theme is a melody repeated often enough to characterize the entire composition. In fact, generally just </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font0"> measures are enough to make the number recognizable. The melody does not always reappear in the same form. Sometimes only a phrase or two of the melody occurs, occasionally a variation on the theme is used, but, in one way or another, the composer skillfully weaves his melody in and out of the composition until it permeates the whole and characterizes it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">37 So it should be with the theme of a talk. The key words or theme idea repeated are like the recurring melody of a composition. Synonyms of these words or the central theme idea rephrased serve as variations on the theme. Such means employed discreetly enough not to become monotonous will cause the subject theme to become the characteristic expression of the entire talk and it will be the main thought your audience will carry away. If your theme is appropriate, and if it has been emphasized to this extent, then you will have accomplished your purpose in the talk.—See also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">qm</span><span class="font0"> 163 fl4.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>SI. Volume</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">58 a. Comfortably heard; b. fit circumstances; c. fit material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">59 Volume is that quality of speaking that enables all to hear. Since many persons hear with difficulty, proper volume becomes an outstanding quality of speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">eo Our need to be concerned with it is evident in almost every Kingdom Hall where those commenting at meetings from the front of the hall cannot be heard by those in the rear. Furthermore, one speaking from the platform with insufficient volume will fail to inspire his audience. Most persons will not strain to hear; they will just stop listening. Too, in service there are many noises competing for the householder’s attention, whether inside the house or at the door. On the other hand, if volume is too loud, especially in discussing some subjects, those listening will withdraw from the speaker, at least mentally. So adjust your volume to fit the circumstances and the material.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">a. Comfortably heard</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">61 The first consideration in determining how much volume to use is best analyzed by the question, Was the necessary power of voice exercised? That is, were you heard in the back row without drowning those in the front? That might be a sufficient consideration for the beginning student, but those more advanced should endeavor to acquire the other two aspects of volume as well. The school servant should determine to what extent each student will be counseled on this quality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">b. Fit circumstances</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">62 A speaker must be aware of varying conditions under which he speaks. It broadens his powers of discernment, makes him more flexible and allows him to reach and hold his audience with greater ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">63 Conditions vary from hall to hall and with the size of the audience. To control the circumstances you must control your volume. Giving a talk in the Kingdom Hall requires more volume than in the living room of a person of goodwill. Furthermore, a small group near the front of the hall, as at an assembly for field service, will require less volume than when the hall is filled, as at a service meeting. Similarly in the home, if a study is conducted with one or two persons, less volume will be needed than if the speaker is talking or commenting at a congregation book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">64 But even these conditions are not constant. Sudden noises arise outside and inside the hall. The passing of a car, a nearby train, loud animal noises, the crying of children, a late arrival, all these require an adjustment in your power of voice. Failure to recognize them and compensate for them in volume will cause something, perhaps a vital point, to be missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">65 Many congregations have amplifying equipment for the voice. But if care is not exercised in its use, and the volume fluctuates extremely from loud to soft, then it might be necessary to counsel the student for lack of consideration of these circumstances. —See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">qm</span><span class="font0"> 66 J|6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">66 Occasionally a speaker will find this quality of volume difficult to master simply because of the quality of his voice. If this is your problem and your voice just does not carry, the school servant will consider it in giving counsel. He might suggest certain exercises or a program of training that will help to develop and strengthen your voice. However, voice quality itself is a separate point for counsel and will not be stressed in considering your volume. But if you cannot strengthen your voice sufficiently in one or two talks to be comfortably heard, the school servant will no doubt mark your counsel slip “SI” in the space ‘‘Main points on which to work” and allow you to continue with the next point for counsel. But you should continue to work to strengthen your voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">67 Not every existing circumstance can be judged in any one talk. Counsel should be given on the current talk, not on every possibility that might arise. However, if the need seems to exist, the school servant might warn a student of possible problems that he might meet under different circumstances, even though the student is commended for his current talk and his counsel slip marked “G.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">68 How can the student determine whether his volume is ample? Audience reaction is one of the best barometers. An experienced speaker will closely observe those at the rear of the hall during his introduction and will be able to determine from their expression arid general attitude whether they can bear comfortably, and he will vary his volume accordingly. Once he has acquired the “feel” of the hall, he will have no more difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">69 Another means is to observe other speakers on the same program. Are they easily heard? How much volume are they using? Adjust yours accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">c. Fit material</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">70 This aspect of volume should not be confused with modulation (S8). It is intended simply to fit the volume to the particular material being discussed. For example, if denunciations were being read from the Scriptures, obviously the volume would be regulated differently than if the student were reading counsel on love among the brother?. Compare also Isaiah 36: 11 with verses 12 and 13 and note the differences that must have existed in the way these statements were spoken. Volume must be adapted to the material but should never be overdone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">71 This aspect of volume can be accomplished by analyzing your material and your purpose carefully. If you want to change the thinking of your audience, do not drive them away by too much volume. However, if you want to stimulate them to spirited activity, perhaps the volume could be stronger. If the material calls for strength, do not weaken it by speaking too softly. But remember, increased volume is not the only way to strengthen your speech. Further ways will be considered under “S5. Sense Stress.”</span></p>

He must appreciate that his dedication is without reservations and that it lasts forever. This decisive step must be followed up with works of righteousness and regularly preaching the good news in company with other Christians. Just as we expect Jehovah to fulfill his promises to us, so we must give to him what we have promised him —our exclusive devotion, worship and service.—Eccl. 5 : 5, 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The help we give to new ones does not end with their immersion. If they have not yet completely studied </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life,”</span><span class="font10"> we should continue our studies with them until they have done so. One’s baptismal date should be recorded, as this serves as a date for one’s ordination. So the local congregation should be notified promptly upon return from the assembly where the baptism was performed. This date will then be recorded on the Publisher’s Record card, and a copy of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font10"> signed by the congregation servant, will be given to the newly baptized one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Baptism is a definite requirement for Christians. It is our joy and privilege to help persons of goodwill appreciate the importance of dedication and baptism and then further assist them to gain spiritual maturity and eventual salvation. &quot;Will you take .your part in helping these thousands to take the first step?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">♦ When a congregation contemplates building a Kingdom Hall it should, before taking any action before a zoning board, determine from the authorities the provisions of the local zoning.or-dinance. Also, it should ascertain if there are in the deed covering the proposed property any restrictive covenants forbidding churches or limiting building to private residences. Then the congregation should communicate with the Society’s legal office for advice on legal procedure to follow. There are available printed documents prepared by Society’s counsel for use by the brothers in handling Kingdom Hall matters before zoning boards and city or county officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Conducting Productive Studies?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you enjoyed the warmly satisfying experience of aiding one with whom you have studied to share in the service? How often each one of us has this experience depends to an extent upon our effectiveness as teachers. As we do our part to conduct home Bible studies in an effective manner, Jehovah gives the increase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Bible studies produce new publishers. The following chart shows how productive our studies are. By dividing each year’s increase in the average number of publishers into that year’s average number of Bible studies, we have determined the number of studies needed to produce one new publisher, and the result is shown on the chart.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font0">Year Worldwide United States 1957 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.7</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font0">1958 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.0</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font0">1959 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.0</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark23"><span class="font0">1960 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.5</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark25"><span class="font0">5-yr, Av. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.5</span></a></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In analyzing the five-year chart, observe that it has taken more home Bible studies to produce one new publisher-in the United States than the worldwide average. How productive were the studies in your congregation? If there were 110 studies reported, on an average, each month for the congregation last year, did 10 new publishers result? Or, did you do better, perhaps harvesting 10 new ones from only 95 studies, which is the worldwide average? Each congregation servant, working closely with the Bible study servant, will want to have these figures in mind and check to see how the congregation in which he serves is doing and how it may improve in conducting productive home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> To be productive, studies need to be conducted regularly each week and with a definite purpose. Remember, preparation for the study is so necessary. If the teacher is prepared, the student quickly develops confidence in the instruction received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Pointing the student to the organization and the service starts with the first study. Scriptural support for preaching with the organization should be expressed at succeeding studies in addition to using such aids as the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> convention reports, etc., to acquaint him with the organization. Talking to others who have been successful in starting new ones in the service may give you ideas to use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Have you conducted a study for years without the student’s sharing</span></p></li></ul>

Many new and young publishers will want to share along with the rest of us. Simplified sermons are made to order for these and also for mature publishers who find the householder busy.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup>-“Good morning. My name is ----. I’m stopping for just a moment in a community service. Many churches today have been encouraging their people to read the Bible. Some persons have wondered why they should make this effort or how a person would be benefited by reading the Bible. God’s own Word of truth gives the answer at John 17:3, where it says: . . . [Read John 17:3.] You see, it is everlasting life that is held out as a reward to those who study the Bible and get a knowledge of God and Christ Jesus. This study is made easier by means of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </span><span class="font10">This modern-language Bible is yours on a contribution of $1. With it</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">District Assemblies in 1962</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> If you are planning to attend one of the earlier assemblies, are your plans complete? Have you sent your room request to the convention city? Volunteer Service slips should also be filled out and turned in to your congregation. These are the preliminaries to the joyful time you will have gathering together with your brothers and persons of goodwill at the Courageous Ministers District Assemblies to take in accurate knowledge. Plan to be present during the entire three days. There will be field service Friday morning, with the assembly sessions beginning Friday afternoon at 1: 50. Stay till the conclusion Sunday afternoon at 5:45. To get the most out of the assembly, you will want a Bible and a songbook, and you may want to have a pad for taking notes. Notes will be helpful when talking to your brothers about the we are giving a copy of this printed sermon.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “Good morning. Ours is an educational work. Our calls are brief and are especially directed toward people who believe in God and who want to be instructed by him. Proverbs 3:5, 6 tells us that that is the best instruction we can get. It says: . . . [Read Proverbs 3:5, 6.] Getting such instruction from the Bible is much simpler with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font10"> It has been translated into the language that we speak today. We are leaving this complete Bible, along with this printed Bible sermon, on a contribution of just $1.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> These one-scripture sermons have proved to be extremely effective. Change the wording to suit your personality and use them in your house-to-house work whenever a brief presentation is needed. Thus equipped, all of us can approach the doors with confidence, knowing that our presentations will be both clear and powerful. Let that confidence be apparent as you present the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> appreciating that what you say can save the lives of those to whom you speak. It can also save yours.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">sessions and also as a review when you get home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> While at an assembly as well as at home we want to be generous with the good things Jehovah has given us and manifest this by sharing in the field service during the periods allotted for it. By obtaining territory in advance, say the evening before, it will not be necessary to go to the convention grounds in the morning but you can go directly to your territory. When staying in private homes remember the additional opportunities to witness. The ones with whom you stay should be invited to the convention and particularly to the public meeting. It is always a good idea to have literature with you en route to the assembly. Magazines especially are appropriate and convenient.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">^Brother Knorr served </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> two-day assembly in Caguas, Puerto Rico; 2,938 attended public meeting and 59 were baptized. He attended two assemblies in the Dominican Republic; 284 were present at Santiago, 863 in Santo Domingo. He saw some of the brothers in Haiti and spoke to 2,537 in Kingston, Jamaica. He reports that the work in all fifteen countries visited on this recent service tour is moving along very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Portugal has banned publications of Jehovah’s witnesses; thousands of magazines reported destroyed. Foreigners in Portugal known to be Jehovah's witnesses have been put out of the country. Brothers continue faithfully in pure worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">^Our missionaries, both Americans and Canadians, have been deported from Haiti, with no reason being given to them by the authorities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">in the service? If so, analyze the study and determine the reasons why. Is it only a social call without a purpose? Have you tried the suggestions above and those printed previously in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers?</span><span class="font10"> If not, then do so promptly. If so, and there is still no success, then perhaps the study could be turned over to someone else and you could use your time more profitably looking for new people who will make more rapid progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Conducting productive home Bible studies is an art. Your artistry in committing to others the good news will bring you much satisfaction and will produce others “adequately qualified to teach.” (2 Tim. 2:2) Such productiveness glorifies Jehovah and wins his favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tion. As far as we are concerned, it is the way we live every day. To the old world it is amazing. Worldly persons are particularly impressed by the good behavior of the children at Jehovah’s witnesses’ conventions. Our decorum can be an excellent silent witness, because we are always under scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> By attending the assemblies we will gain many spiritual blessings from Jehovah. We are thankful to him for the arrangements made. So let us exhibit it bj<sup>r</sup> attending. Be courageous in your plans and then see that they are consummated by being present at the district assemblies this summer.</span></p>

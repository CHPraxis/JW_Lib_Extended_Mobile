<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL, 1962 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.”—Ps. 27:14.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">BE ACTIVATED BY JEHOVAH'S SPIRIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What wonderful work can be accomplished when one is activated by Jehovah’s spirit! The same spirit that strengthened men such as Stimson, Jesus and the apostles backs us up today in doing a preaching work that is beyond our own capacity, filling us with courage to preach fearlessly. Paul therefore urges all of us: “Be aglow with the spirit.” All who are thus activated by Jehovah’s spirit will be having a zealous share in the ministry during April—Rom. 12 : 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Prominent in our program for the month is the April 8 public talk on the topic “Christendom Has Failed God ! After Her End, What?” and the Memorial, on April 17. We all plan to attend because we appreciate the importance of these meetings, but now it would be a good idea for each one of us to make a list of those we would like to invite. We want to be sure they know about the meetings, help them to get there, and make them feel welcome when they come.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark0"><span class="font11">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR APRIL</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20“Percent Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Another aspect of April’s activity that always is a matter of keen interest on our part is reaching out for the 20-percent increase. As a stimulus toward this goal, the congregation servant will meet with the book study conductors by April 1 to discuss ways to give loving aid. All of us should endeavor to be out the first week in April; then each week as the assistant congregation servant gives a list of names of those who need help to the study conductors, it will be our privilege to offer assistance to these publishers. By working together we can help all to avail themselves during April of the greatest privilege open to man—serving Jehovah God I</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What about helping new ones in the service? This is an especially happy service, but we must take the initiative in making arrangements. Do not hold back. If ever persons are going to get into the new world they must learn to be active praisers of Jehovah. So if those with whom you study love Jehovah God and believe his Word, point out to them</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do you want to share in a most pleasant, joyful and rewarding feature of Jehovah’s service? Then we encourage you to participate in the Bible study work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What does an analysis of our Bible study activity during the first five months of this service year show? That 40.1 percent of the publishers share in this rewarding work. This means that approximately 160,000 publishers in the United States do not conduct home Bible studies. Can you make room for this profitable and joyful activity? Where does your congregation stand in this regard?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The chart printed with this article provides us with an analysis of the Bible study work for all the congregations in the United States. Look at it carefully. With a quota of one Bible study per publisher, is your congregation among the 243 that commendably average between one and three Bible studies per publisher? Or, among the 2,185 congregations that average from .6 to .9 of a Bible study per publisher? Or is your congregation among the 1,905 congregations averaging from .1 to .5 of a study per publisher? On an individual basis, how does your personal Bible study activity compare with that of your congregation? What can you do to increase your share in this work? Whether that it is their privilege to share it with others, and then make definite arrangements for them to share with you in doing so. At the end of the month, if you find that the congregation has reached its 20-percent goal, be sure to mark the congregation report card “We made it!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazines</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Our Activation by Jehovah’s Spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min; Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on “Our Activation by Jehovah’s Spirit.” (See “Watchtower,” July 15, 1961, pp. 424-436, and April 1, 1962, p. 215.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Question-and-answer discussion of main article, “Be Activated by Jehovah’s Spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Inviting Goodwill Persons to Special Talk and Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Exhorts all publishers to attend special talk and Memorial and to put forth singular effort to invite all goodwill persons. Following scenes will take place throughout month. Note points made and follow suggested presentations for inviting persons to both occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (4 min.) Accounts servant and a study conductor discuss the work of inviting all magazine subscribers to Memorial, using names and addresses of those subscribing since January, 1961. Publisher who obtained subscription will be given name and address and asked to call. If original publisher is unable to call, study conductor will arrange for another publisher to make the call and invite the subscriber to Memorial. Study conductor will give out names and addresses at next meeting at service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) What could be said when calling on subscribers? Circumstances- will govern this to some extent but the following suggestions will help. Take careful note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (4 min.) Publisher calls at home of subscriber. After friendly greeting says, “I have stopped by today to invite you to two special events held by Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide. The first one is this talk on April 8, [Gives householder handbill] ‘Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?’ [Give local information on time and place.] On Tuesday, April 17, the most important event of the year for all Jehovah’s witnesses will be celebrated. It is the memorial of Christ’s death. Like the apostles and other early Christians, we yearly hold this as a means of remembrance. (1 Cor. 11:23-25) We want to extend a special invitation to you as a subscriber for [‘The Watchtower’ or ‘Awake!’]. [Gives householder Memorial handbill, explains time and place, and arranges to bring him to Memorial.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) We want to invite not only subscribers but all those who have shown interest and those with whom we conduct studies. Listen to this publisher as he invites his Bible student to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE III (4 min.) Publisher, at the conclusion of home Bible study, says to student, “We have learned much regarding the great sacrifice Jesus made for our benefit and for the vindication of his Father’s name. In view of this, I know you will want to attend the memorial of Christ’s last supper at our Kingdom Hall [Give local time and place]. The same observance is taking place in over 21,500 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide. We do this in obedience to the command Jesus gave his followers at Luke 22:19 [Have householder read]. This is your personal invitation to attend [Give Memorial handbill].” Continues with brief discussion of Memorial significance and makes definite arrangements to pick up Bible student so he may attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Do not forget to invite those who obtained Bibles in December as well as all subscribers. Record attendances will result as we invite and helpfully assist all persons of goodwill to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Concluding comments. Cover “What Happened Here in February?” and consider local report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Discussion by two or three study conductors, covering points and suggestions forthcoming from meeting with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —demonstrate, showing how a new one would be prepared for service and how parents will aid their children to prepare and share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Encourage congregation to use remaining time to invite persons to attend Memorial. (Comment on slogan, based on 1 Corinthians 11:24, at bottom of page 1.) Give appropriate counsel for all to take the initiative to make new persons attending feel welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Read pioneer letter and give talk based on points in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Increase Your Bible Study Activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 min: Use of Subscription Expiration Slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) When “Watchtower” and “Awake!” subscription expiration slips are received, congregation servant will see that they are immediately distributed through service centers and calls promptly made. If possible, publisher originally obtaining subscription should make return visit, and this is counted as a back-call. These are excellent source of new subscriptions. Effort should be made to start studies where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (5 min.) Study conductor approaches publisher after book study to give some expiration slips, suggests calls be made on back-call night or after Sunday morning service. Publisher asks how to make effective approach, as he has had poor results from calling with slip in hand asking if householder wanted to subscribe again. Conductor explains need to rekindle interest first. Suggests warm, friendly greeting, giving of current sermon, concluding with subscription offer. As with other interested persons, an effort should be made to start a Bible study. Publisher appreciates counsel, is invited by conductor to go with him as he makes some expired-subscription calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (8 min.) At call conductor uses householder’s name: “Good morning,---. We represent the pub</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">lishers of the ‘Watchtower’ magazine (or ‘Awake!’). We are interested in all persons who are concerned about conditions today and especially those who believe in God’s Word. In reading ‘The Watchtower’ no doubt you have increased your hope in the Kingdom we have all prayed for. As servants of Jehovah ...” Proceeds with sermon, makes offer, directing attention to interesting point in magazine, telling that similar information will come to householder by means of subscription. Now for first time conductor lets householder see expiration slip, saying he will be glad to renew subscription so householder will not miss any more issues containing interesting articles such as one just discussed. Householder subscribes. Publisher ascertains householder has few minutes, demonstrates use of “Good News” booklet as Bible-study aid. (Chairman adds: If householder busy, then use simplified sermon as outlined in March “Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Each month Society sends out thousands of expiration slips. Summarize need for (1) promptly making calls; (2) giving sermon first to rekindle interest before offering subscription; (3) arranging for Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk and a few questions and answers on attending the 1962 district assemblies. See article “Courageous Ministers Assemblies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization” article, “An Invitation to Work Unassigned Territory.” Also appropriate “Yearbook” experiences would work in well. (See “Index.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Two or three study conductors discuss and demonstrate what they are going to do along with their service groups, in the remaining days of the month (1) to aid any who have not yet reported, (2) assist any new ones who are ready to start service but have not yet done so, (3) follow up on subscription promises and expiration slips, (4) distribute any remaining copies of the special issues. 10 min: Concluding comments, with encouragement to use the remaining weekend to the fullest advantage. (Include remarks on the slogan, based on Acts 18:25, at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Another very fine report! We increased in publishers over January. In fact, only in December of this service year did we have more publishers than February. Continue lovingly assisting one another, brothers. Bible studies too commendably continue to increase. In September, 1961, 180,259 were reported; last month, 204,620. Keep up the splendid work to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As shown in the 1962 unassigned territory booklet, a copy of which is being sent to each congregation, there remain in the United States about 900 unassigned territories. Many of these, as shown below, have not been worked for many years:</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It is most gratifying to see that 548, over one-half of all unassigned territories, were worked last year. As a result of the fine effort put forth fewer counties remained unassigned than in any other year since 1952.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> This year the Society anticipates that virtually all unassigned territory will be worked. Why? First of all, with district assemblies conveniently located for all this summer, cutting down on travel and expense, the Society feels sure many more publishers and pioneers will be able to work unassigned territory during</span></p>

One tour will be from New York to the “Holy Land” and return, including stops at the conventions in Europe and a tour of the “Holy Land” along with those traveling around the world. The trip would take about three weeks and the air fare on jet is presently $876.60 per person (adult). The other tour being arranged by the Society is from New York or Chicago or the west coast to Honolulu and return. Those traveling could also attend the assembly in Los Angeles if desired. Time required would be one week for the Honolulu assembly or two weeks for both Honolulu and Los Angeles. Air fares are: New York to Honolulu and return, $575.88; Chicago to Honolulu and return, $481.06; west coast to Honolulu and return, $266.00. These are jet coach fares as of January 1, 1962, Any brothers planning to take any of these tours should write to the Society’s Travel Desk at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, for additional information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Plan now to vacation pioneer this summer or before. It is encouraging to see that from September, 1961, through February, 1962, 8,461 vacation pioneers enrolled; whereas the year before during the same period there were 5,739.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In addition to working unassigned territory during the summer months, as announced at the United Worshipers District Assemblies last summer, it is now possible for congregations to request additional territory that is available for working. If a congregation is frequently covering its territory and publishers and pioneers are in a position to travel to a nearby unassigned territory to work in it regularly, a request can be made to the Society for such territory to be added to the congregation’s permanent territory assignment. Territories requested should be conveniently located so that publishers can travel there on weekends or during the week, and possibly various ones when on vacation can stay in the territory and work for a week or more. Congregations that are interested should consult the unassigned territory booklet. Circuit servants will work closely with congregation servants in following through on this arrangement.</span></p>

If you have taken time to peruse their contents, we are sure you agree that these are issues that make unmistakably clear where pure worship is carried on today and where men can turn for wise guidance in this time and a sound hope for the future. Their distribution should do much in the dividing of the “sheep” from the “goats.” Let us use them well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup> If we are zealous in offering the magazines, it should not be at all difficult for publishers to place 30 during April, pioneers 120, and special pioneers 180. Be prepared with brief, to-the-point presentations when you go in service and have plenty of magazines with you to place. What happened in a congregation in Kentucky last April was not an isolated experience. The brothers wired to the Society to rush them more magazines, saying: “Today 19 of us out in magazine work, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font13"> 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In most cases it will be practical for the brothers to attend the nearest assembly. However, due to the large number of people in certain metropolitan areas, the size of the cities and the size of the assembly auditoriums or stadiums, certain recommendations are being made by the Society so attendance will be in keeping with the facilities in each city. The difference in distances is slight and should affect only a very few. Please check the following list carefully to see where your circuit is assigned to attend. Columbus, Ga.: Ga. #2 ; Circuit 23. Costa Mesa, Calif.: Calif. #1, 3, 16, 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Of course, our desire is not merely to leave two magazines with a householder and then forget him. We want, hint to continue to receive aid. One way this is possible is by arranging for him to subscribe. This is the last month of our </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">subscription campaign, and by the end of the month each one of us should have met his quota. Have you met yours? Following through on subscription promises, expiration slips and placements of the special issues will open the way for many to subscribe, and it shows our desire to see them receive continued aid. That aid also can and should be offered in another way: By means of home Bible studies. Personal instruction is needed if persons of goodwill are to get a real grasp of the truth and take their stand on Jehovah's side. Responding to the direction of Jehovah’s spirit, we have the opportunity to see that they receive that aid in many ways during April.</span></p>

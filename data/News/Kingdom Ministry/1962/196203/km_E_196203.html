<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH, 1962 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope tn Jehovah.”—Ps. 27:14. VOL. V NO. 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Prophesy with God's Loyal Organization</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It Is a grand privilege that we have in prophesying with God’s organization. Not that we of ourselves tell what the future holds, but, under the direction of Jehovah’s loyal organization, we do make known what God in his Word says about the future; we announce Jehovah’s kingdom. It is that message that was foretold to be preached in our day, and it is that message that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is dedicated to announcing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Already two months of our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription campaign have passed. Are we meeting our quotas? Well, during the month of January 109,173 new subscriptions were obtained by the publishers in the field, and that is fine! Have you as a congregation publisher obtained half of your quota, one subscription, yet? Pioneers, have you obtained ten? Special pioneers, fifteen? It takes consistent work, but how gratifying it is to know that the Kingdom message will be regu-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR MARCH &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">I</span></p></li></ul>

J </span><span class="font9">larly going into the homes of those who subscribe!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In addition to our regular house-to-house work with the offer, the expired subscription notices sent to congregations by the Society provide good possibilities for obtaining subscriptions ; be sure to care for them promptly. Then, too, when a householder says he will subscribe later, do you make out the subscription slip right then? It serves as a reminder to you, and it impresses the householder with the fact that he has said he does want to subscribe. There are also many who have obtained foreign-language subscriptions, so it is good for all of us to be ready to mention that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is available in many languages. Of course, where a subscription is not obtained, we always ought to be alert to offer the two current magazines for ten cents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> We have all had some very fine experiences in using the current sermon, “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” As one publisher wrote: It is “attracting a lot of attention and answering people’s questions about our work.” Use of the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> To return and cultivate the interest of persons of good will is a genuine display of love on our part for the “sheep.” Could our love abound yet more in this regard?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> As was pointed out in the February </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> article “Circuit Servants to Give More Personal Assistance to Publishers,” our back-call activity needs lo be built up considerably. In the last service year publishers averaged 3.2 back-calls, and so far this service year the average remains the same. As outlined in the February </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> our quota has been set at six back-calls per publisher. Is this reasonable? Indeed it is, for by conducting a weekly Bible study we will have four back-calls to report each month and sometimes five, which means making only one or two additional back-calls each month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Do we have the potential to make more back-calls? Yes, very much so! We are doing very well placing literature (3,287,481 placements last service year) and this we want to keep up. However, instead of being content with merely placing literature, we must be diligent to make a record of placements and within a few days or a week call back with the goal of starting studies and aiding persons who have manifested interest to benefit more fully from the literature they ob</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believef </span><span class="font9">with the sermon is also helping to answer questions that many ask. Have you been using them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Of course, the more who share in sermon work, offering the subscription, the better the results will be. So, for the benefit of younger publishers and new ones who need a simpler sermon, a one-scripture sermon is outlined in this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> While we want to use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font9"> 3) tained. Many a letter is received at the Society’s office saying literature was obtained, read and enjoyed— “Will you please send someone </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">call on us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The chart on this page gives </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">breakdown of the back-call work </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font9">all the congregations in the United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Get a Firm Hold on Everlasting Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This meeting is outlined in the February “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Prophesying with God’s Loyal Organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on “Prophesying with God’s Loyal Organization.” (See “Watchtower,” October 1, 1961, pp. 591-598, and March 1, 1962, p. 157.) 15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article “Prophesy with God’s Loyal Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">23 min: Help Each One Use Current Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Excellent work being done with 3- to 8-minute sermons. All who can give them should continue to do so. For the benefit of newer and less experienced publishers, and younger publishers who are not yet able to give entire sermon, Society is providing simplified sermon for current campaign. May it prove useful and open way for more to develop entire sermon in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (8 min.) After close of congregation book study, conductor asks if any have had interesting experiences in “Watchtower” campaign. Several good ones related. Brother Helpful notices Johnny Youthful, who seems dejected, has obtained no subs yet, wishes he could give sermon so he could share in subscription offer. Study conductor then suggests he give simplified sermon, just one scripture and the transition to offer. After introducing himself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses he could say: “Many have wondered why we call from house to house. Well, it is in response to this scripture at Matthew 24:14. [Read the scripture.] You see, we want to share the good news of God’s kingdom, and the best way we know how to do this is by introducing ‘The Watchtower,’ which announces God’s kingdom.” (Encouragement then given to use specific reference to appropriate article as transition and make subscription offer.) Young publisher agrees this would be easy. Asked to try it. Does well; is commended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) By using simplified sermon, many young publishers can share in regular offer. But what about preparing new ones for service? Would it be useful here, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (5 min.) Conclusion of home Bible study with Mr. Responsive. Teacher explains great pleasure and privilege of sharing good news. (1 Tim. 4:16) Mr. Responsive says he would be willing to share in work but could not give entire sermon like his teacher. Brother Helpful asks: “What if only one scripture were involved? Do you think you could handle a presentation like this?” He replies favorably. They discuss how to present Matthew 24:14, showing that good news is such a welcome change from the great amount of bad news today. Further discussion of an effective transition and talking points on value of “The Watchtower” follows, and new publisher is prepared for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Simplified sermon seems very versatile. How would it prove useful where the householder is very busy? Let’s watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (4 min.) Woman answers door, but obviously is quite busy. On encountering “I’m busy” objection, Brother Helpful says: “I can see you are very busy and I won’t take a great deal of your time, but if I might leave just one thought with you it would be this one from Matthew 24:14.” (Then he reads the scripture, explains the purpose of his call and makes offer.) Chairman explains that if regular offer is not made due to limited time or circumstances, we can offer two latest magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) New publishers, less experienced publishers, youthful publishers, yes, each one can use simplified sermon in connection with the “Watchtower” offer. May Jehovah’s blessing be fully upon this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan, based on 1 Corinthians 14:1, at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Report from school servant on visit with congregation servant. He will cover information in “Notice to School Servants,” also the benefits of the school, and point out why all should regularly attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Increase Your Back-Call Work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Publisher who is studying with person of good will who is ready for service inquires of Bible study servant what would be best way to approach and prepare new one for April service. Bible study servant reviews and demonstrates pertinent points from November, 1961, “Kingdom Ministry,” under “Your Service Meetings,” 2d, 3d and 4th meetings, on working for increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan, based on 1 Timothy 6:19, at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization” article “Starting New Ones to Report Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">23 min: Helping All Publishers to Report Time in the Field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Congregation overseer discusses need for all to share in service each month. Lovingly concerned that some have been irregular. Wanting to help them become regular publishers, he called on some, was able to help them work out their problem. Others may have similar problem and may profit from discussion he had. “First I called on Brother Forgetful.” (From here on demonstrate with publishers as outlined below.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (18 min.) Brother Forgetful means well but lets the month pass and forgets to turn in a report. Overseer counsels that it is a matter of training ourselves to report promptly; explains purpose of weekly report, suggests that it be turned in when attending Sunday meetings. “Forgetful” appreciative of counsel, will be happy to report weekly. Overseer briefly summarizes importance of all reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next he talks with Sister No Help, who explains she would like to get out more often but just does not feel qualified. He knows Sister Mature would be happy to assist her, suggests they work together Sundays. “No Help” hesitates; has difficult unbelieving husband; Sunday would be difficult. Saturday would be fine. He will arrange for Sister Mature to work with her; gives her sample magazine presentation to prepare. She is thankful, enthusiastic over prospect of receiving help. (Summarize, and invite publishers with this problem to talk to you after meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next talks with Sister Many Children. With five children she has difficulty finding time for service. He tells of another sister nearby who has four children and same problem. Suggests they cooperate in caring for each other’s children so they can get out in service. She feels this is excellent suggestion, will see other sister to make immediate plans. (Briefly summarize benefit.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next asks Brother Little Service why report not received from him last month. Replies he felt that one hour spent in service was just too insignificant to report. Using Jesus’ illustration of widow’s mite (Mark 12:41-44), overseer shows that Jehovah accepts our reasonable service. By having a personal schedule we can often do even more. (Eph. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">5:15, 16) </span><span class="font8">Explains how one half hour in service before weekly book study would add at least two hours to monthly report. Publisher agrees that he could do more, is happy for suggestion and now realizes importance of reporting. (Summarize need for reasonable schedule adjusted to individual circumstances.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Overseer asks Brother Confident why he missed sharing in service. “Confident,” surprised, says, “I was out and I reported service last month.” Overseer tactfully tells him no report was received. “Confident” repeats, “I’m sure, in fact, I’m confident I turned in a report.” He is shown several slips turned in with no name. “Confident” timidly admits one is his, will be more careful with future reports. (Summarize importance of reporting promptly and accurately.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Show how this loving assistance will be continued to aid all publishers to share in service each month. All sharing regularly will help us reach 20-percent goal, but, more importantly, results in salvation. —Rom. 10:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: “Are You Ready for April?” —lively discussion between two energetic publishers.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Each year thousands participate in the ministry for the first time. It is our privilege to help those with whom we study to see this privilege; it is also important to be sure that they properly understand what the Bible says about the personal lives of those who bear the name of God. So, while we do not tactlessly pry into their private lives, we do point out to them what the Scriptures say about honesty, relations between the sexes and drunkenness. Those whose lives harmonize with what the Bible says on such matters and who show a sincere desire to serve Jehovah should be encouraged to do so.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Persons who start in the service should really want to serve Jehovah and they should understand the purpose of the ministry. When such persons have an actual share in giv-</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Notice to School Servants</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">i The question has been raised as to the number of “G’s” that may be given on any one talk in the use of the new Speech Counsel form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Z</span><span class="font8"> In the October, 1961, “Kingdom Ministry,’’ the article “New Speech Counsel Slip,’’ paragraph three, suggests a total of two or three. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but the most good will be accomplished if no more points are considered than the school servant can properly discuss in his counsel and no more than the student can effectively give attention to in any one talk. Both the student and the school benefit most from counsel when the school servant gives clear and specific reasons for his counsel, with examples from the talk wherever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3 No one need feel that some weakness must be noted and corrected for the student to benefit from counsel. Commendation, properly given with reasons, is upbuilding because of the right examples demonstrated to all. Besides, even the most advanced students, who may receive only commendation, still have the next three points on the counsel slip to work on for the next talk and even if these are basic qualities already learned by the advanced student, his earnest attention to them in sequence will make for general improvement in all features of good speaking as well as his own particular weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">4 However, in order that no student be retarded in overcoming some “outstanding” weakness not next in order for counseling, the school servant should discuss it with the student privately so that he can begin to correct it. If advisable, this can be entered in the space “Main points on which to work” as a reminder. Private counsel is best in such instances so as not to interrupt the sequence outlined on the counsel form and so that the student will always know that the points on which he will receive counsel are the next ones in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 Both the school servant and the student have responsibilities. Meet them consistently and the entire school will benefit greatly.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">ing the witness, they should be invited to report their activity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Christian parents too train their children in the field service. But the question is often asked, “When should children start to report?” There is no age limit, but when they know what they are doing and share in giving the witness because they want to, then their reports are acceptable. Parents should aid their children to share in the service and to report each month once they start.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Will those with whom you are studying share in the service during April? Really, to a great extent, much depends on you. Ask yourself: Have I arranged to take them to the Kingdom Hall with me? Have I acquainted them with the organization and its activities? Have I awakened in them a desire to share with others the good things they have learned? Have I helped them prepare something to say, perhaps the simplified sermon outlined under “Your Service Meetings”? Have I invited them to go along with me in service, suggesting a definite time and feature of service? By doing these things, help them in the service in April, and assist them to continue regularly serving Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregation servants should check now to be sure they have submitted the congregation’s order for Memorial invitations, handbills for the special public talk, and a sufficient supply of the special magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregation servants will arrange for the accounts servant to list on sheets of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record sheets since January, 1961. Each sheet should show the name of the publisher obtaining the subscription, and these should be given to the publishers by the end of March so they can invite all subscribers to attend the April 8 public talk and the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregations that attend a circuit assembly on April 8 will hear the regular circuit assembly public talk. These congregations may schedule the special talk for April 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Memorial report card is being sent to each congregation with the March statement. The congregation servant will please see that it is filled out and put in the mail promptly after the Memorial celebration, April 17. Congregations served by the circuit servant will have the ministry school and service meeting Wednesday night that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Have you noticed that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font8"> for 1961 contains references to the experiences published in the current </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font8"> as well as the one for last year? Note, for example, the listings under “Back-Calls,” “Bible Studies,” “Field Ministry,” “House-to-House Record,” “Pioneers,” “Vacation Pioneer.” Also under “Jews,” “Marriage,” “Roman Catholic Church” and others are experiences</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">full sermon as much as possible, this will help more to share in the sermon work, and it can even be used to good advantage by mature publishers when they find householders who are too busy to listen to the entire sermon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> As we share in prophesying with God’s loyal organization, let us always keep in mind that our goal is more than the placing of literature; it is to turn sheeplike persons to the worship of Jehovah. So we must always be alert to start home Bible studies and to give the needed personal instruction to those who show a desire for the truth. What a privilege it is to serve with Jehovah’s organization in accomplishing this work!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Your Back-Call Work </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’A)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>G</sup> To help us share more fully and effectively in this loving service, consider the following points: Be sure to (1) keep a record of placements, (2) arrange to have some share in back-call work each week, if possible supporting back-call night from your service center and spending the third hour on Sunday making return visits, and (3) endeavor to start at least one home Bible study and conduct it each week. The Bible study servant and all study conductors will take a zealous lead in this feature of the ministry and work with ones who wish assistance ; so do not hesitate to ask for their help. When the circuit servant visits, he too will give personal attention to the back-call work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To Catholics Who Object to Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We often hear objections from Catholic householders who are prejudiced against Jehovah’s witnesses. Many of them have heard or read things written about us that caused them to form adverse opinions, but a kind and tactful approach may open the way to talk to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Often householders interrupt the presentation to object: “I’m a Catholic and I’m not interested.” We might tactfully reply, “I know that, as a Catholic, you respect the Bible very much and have been urged by the pope to read and study it constantly. Most likely you have read in your own Catholic Bible where the pope has said that, one will receive three hundred days’ indulgence for every fifteen minutes spent reading the Bible. Jehovah’s witnesses see and appreciate the need for more people to read their Bible; so much so that we call at their homes for this very purpose. We feel it is a responsibility given by Jehovah God to help others to come to know him and his Word.” (Then go into the sermon.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In Catholic communities it has been found helpful to state that the name Jehovah is described in the footnote of various editions of the Catholic Douay Bible at Exodus 6: 3 and is there acknowledged to be an anglicized form of God’s name. Then it is easy to go into Isaiah 43:10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> April is almost here. Are we all ready for it? There is always much special activity during April, and for that reason it is a month filled with special blessings, is it not? We all want to have a full share in the work that has been planned; so now is the time for us to get ready. But how?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> First, by scheduling our time so we can attend all the meetings and share as fully as possible in the special field-service activities. Many vacation pioneered last April to have a greater share. Are you planning to do that this April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> On April 8 we will all gather to hear the special public talk “Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?” And on April 17 we will assemble for the Memorial, the most Important meeting of the year. There is much to do by way of preparation, because we want to encourage all persons of good will to</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In predominantly Catholic territory, this introduction has been effectively used : “I am sharing in the Christian visitation work of Jehovah’s witnesses. No doubt you are acquainted with the suggestion made by a prominent Catholic official [John A. O’Brien, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Extension,</span><span class="font9"> January, 1959] that. Catholics would do well to go from door to door as Jehovah’s witnesses do. Perhaps some Catholics have done this, but it does raise the question, ‘Why do Jehovah’s witnesses go to the homes of the people, especially when they know that most people like yourself already have a religion?’” (Then go into the sermon.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Do not feel discouraged when the objection is raised. View their objection as an honest opinion that may be changed by your confident presentation of the truth. We know their life depends upon their acceptance of the message, so we should lovingly make every effort to let them hear it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">for Agpril?</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">_______</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">attend both of these important occasions. To assist us, the accounts servant will make a list of all subscribers in the territory and give the names and addresses to those who obtained the subscriptions. Then, starting April 1 we will all be calling on these persons, using the Memorial invitations and handbills to invite them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Right after the public talk on April 8 the special April 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will be released, and all of us, along with persons of good will, will be invited to obtain copies for distribution. The April 22 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> also a special issue, is on the theme “Early Christianity and ModernDay Religion.” They both contain information that should be given wide distribution, but that calls for preparation on the part of each one of us. Have you placed your order with the magazine-territory servant for extra copies of these two issues yet?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The. number of publishers sharing in service was excellent, and especially when considering: the adverse weather in most parts of the country. This January we had 20,086 more publishers than one year ago. Very fine, indeed. While hours and magazines dropped off, back-calls and Bible studies increased nicely. We increased from 191,893 Bible studies in December up to 199,549 in January. Excellent! May all continue taking advantage of each opportunity to start and then regularly conduct Bible studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Also, we want to invite new ones to share with us in the ministry. Let us talk to them about it now, and in April we will try to start them in service early in the month and help them to share as often as possible. In addition to sharing in house-to-house work with the simplified sermon or with the magazines, many new ones will want to have copies of the special magazines to place with their friends and relatives. It is up to us to see that they are well supplied. A 20-percent increase in publishers, which is our goal for April, would mean 298,417 in the service. If all of us share in the ministry and encourage and help new ones, then, with Jehovah’s blessing, we can make it. But April is almost here; hence now is the time for us to get ready so as to have the fullest possible share in the special activities planned.</span></p></li></ul>

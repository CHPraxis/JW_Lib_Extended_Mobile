<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER, 1962 “Be courageous and lei your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.”—«Ps. 27:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. V NO. 12</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Courageous Through Faith and Hope in Jehovah</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Though living in the midst of a world filled with fear, we as Jehovah’s witnesses do not share the world’s anxiety. Our strong faith in Jehovah and our hope based on liis unfailing promises make us courageous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For that reason we can with earnestness urge others who long for a righteous world to take courage. What better way could there be to accomplish this than by sharing enthusiastically in distribution of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font11"> We know that people who fail to read the Bible as well as those who resid it without understanding do not appreciate Jehovah’s purposes; they do not have a sustaining hope. That is why we want them to obtain the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New &quot;World Translation..</span><span class="font11"> Its modern speech will encourage them to read the Scriptures, doing so with increased understanding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Of course, when we offer them the Bible, many hesitate to accept it or simply say, No. Why? Well, they probably have a Bible, perhaps several of them. Then, too, persons who lack a knowledge of the Bible are often suspicious of new translations, because they feel that they change God’s Word. These barriers can easily be overcome by having ready a few texts that show them what makes the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Neu: World Translation so</span><span class="font11"> fine. You might use the chart printed in the October 15, 1961, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> or scriptures cited in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font11"> booklet under “Translations.” In this way they can be helped to appreciate that this is not “just another Bible,” and that the “changes” are a matter of putting the scriptures in understandable language. When they realize that this Bible can be theirs for only $1, many will be anxious to obtain it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Consider all the opportunities there are to place the Bible. First of all, there is the house-to-house work, and we should endeavor to spend some time offering the Bible from house to house each week during December. In addition to this, do not overlook your neighbors, relatives, persons who come to your door and those with whom you are employed. One publisher placed six copies with relatives and others who came to the house in just one day. Another placed sixty Bibles in a single month by witnessing to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Extension of Training (Part 1)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Ever since the announcement in the February, 1962, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> circuit and district servants and their wives have been faithfully talking to five or more publishers each week, aiding them to work up schedules calling for ten hours of service each month. That this has aided many to spend more time in service can be seen from the following information written by a congregation servant.: ‘Prior to the circuit servant’s visit, we had sixteen publishers reporting over ten hours a month; sixty were</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">---------------------- &nbsp;——s i OFFER FOR DECEMBER ! , “New World Translation of the Holy! 'Scriptures,” and a booklet, for $1.7</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR DECEMBER |</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Courage Through Faith and Hope ini . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah.—Ps. 27:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">reporting under ten hours. Now, thirty-six report over ten hours, with many others almost reaching the suggested ten-hour goal. Our averages in other features increased in proportion.’ Circuit and district servants and their wives will continue this loving service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Since circuit and district servants are not able to help each one in the congregation during a visit, what about those not helped? Must they await future visits before reworkmates during his lunch period. The important thing is to be alert to offer it at every opportunity. And with every Bible be sure to place the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look! I Am Making All Things New&quot;</span><span class="font11"> to use in starting a home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10-Percent Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do you know that if </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> of us share in this work of Bible distribution we will reach our goal of</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1) </span><span class="font11">ceiving help? No. Congregation servants too can lovingly aid the publishers to work up schedules, doing so (1) before and after the meetings, (2) at the service center, and (3) when visiting the publishers at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If the congregation is large and has many service centers, it may be a number of weeks or even months before the overseer will visit a particular group. Hence a good time to talk to some publishers is before and after the meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Analyze the Publisher’s Record cards to ascertain who needs this help; then take a few moments to talk to some publishers each w’eek. In this way many can be aided to work out schedules that fit their needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>i</sup> As the overseer visits service centers too he will be able to help many work out schedules. This help will in no way interfere with the personal-assistance arrangement being rendered to the newer and less experienced publishers month by month, but, rather, will help to make it more successful. The overseer should commend the ones doing well and those making improvement and kindly help the ones needing assistance. Never should he give publishers the idea that they are being picked on or that he is</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">(2 min.) Brother Questioner raises his hand asking how studies can be started on return visit. Chairman answers that booklet is left with Bible and a study can be started in the booklet. Many placed “Look!” booklet and have had success in starting-studies.

Next, publisher calls attention to short message from The Publisher on inside cover. Then refers to questions on paragraphs 1-4 on page 3. Asks householder to read the first four paragraphs, and then questions are asked again and householder is invited to comment. Publisher states, “You may wonder on what this description is based. It is not a dreamer’s vision. It is based on Bible scriptures.” Refers the householder to the scriptures on the bottom of page 4, which may be looked up. Suggests householder look up the .scriptures in “New World Translation” during the week and he will return to review them so householder may learn more of “the new things that Jehovah has in store.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3 min.) Brother Questioner appreciates helpful suggestions, feels he can start a study.

Point out that these gatherings were a part of the activity of early Christians and indeed beneficial to each one present. Then tell them about our public meetings and, using the handbill, invite them to the talk for Sunday. Householder promises to come, but does not show up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the second one show how to follow up on the matter when the householder does not come on the first invitation. Publisher conducting study takes along- another publisher. After the study publisher tactfully says: “Sorry you could not make it to the talk Sunday. It was such a helpful discussion.” Use one or two texts from last Sunday’s talk, comment on them, showing how helpful such information is in knowing the right course to follow. Then companion publisher presents handbill for talk the coming weekend and comments enthusiastically about subject. Householder feels much was missed by not being present last Sunday, will be present this time. Publisher arranges for them to go together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Chairman (15 min.) In progressively considering sermon get comments from audience as to WHY introduction, transitions between scriptures and conclusion that appear in “Kingdom Ministry” are appropriate. (Note how transitions review verses just read or point to verses next to be read. Observe how they use words and phrases from the scriptures themselves and how presentation is personalized.) Then ask for suggested talking points in current magazine to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: “Who Will Survive Armageddon?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon is God’s war</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">What will happen &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Jer. 25:31, 33</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">What to do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Rom. 10:13, 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suggested presentation: “Good morning. My name is---. The reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">for my brief call this morning is to share information on a subject that is of concern to all. The Bible speaks of a war yet to come called Armageddon. God’s Word tells that every nation on earth will be involved and yet how you and your family may survive. This war will be different from any other war mankind has ever experienced. Observe how it will be different. (Read Rev. 16:14, 16.) It is God’s war. As God takes a personal part, observe what will happen. (Read Jer. 25:31, 33.) Did you notice in verse 31 who will be given to the sword? It is the wicked. Proverbs 2:21, 22 further shows who will perish and who will survive. (Read verses.) To be among the upright ones who survive, what must each one of us do? (Read Rom. 10:13, 14.) I have been greatly aided in learning of Armageddon and God’s provision for survival by reading ‘The Watchtower’ and it can be a great aid to you too. The purpose of the magazine is: [Read the last two sentences in paragraph two or the first sentence in paragraph three on inside of cover.] A subscription for a year is only $1. May I take your subscription now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Competent Publisher (6 min.) Model presentation well prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Chairman (3 min.) Encourage enthusiastic presentation of sermon and subscription. Publishers might carry several issues showing variety of valuable subjects, and copies in a variety of languages. Offer subscriptions everywhere: To relatives, friends, business associates, on Bible studies and back-calls, and especially spend some time each week offering the subscription from house to house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">never satisfied with what they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Finally, when the overseer is visiting publishers in their homes, in an encouraging way he can help many to work up schedules calling for ten hours each month. With the overseer being alert to his responsibilities and discharging them in a loving manner, many more individual publishers will receive the benefits to be derived from this extension of the training provisions.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>WHY PIONEERING IS SO IMPORTANT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">1 The vindication of Jehovah’s name is the most important issue today. Our being alive today is only because God has decreed that this time be allowed in order to settle the issue. He has purposed that his name be sanctified and declared to the world. “For this very cause I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may show my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.” (Rom. 9: 17) Jehovah is selecting people to do this vital work of announcing his name. It is the preaching activity of Jehovah’s people that is used in separating the nations before Armageddon. “And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” (Matt. 25: 32) This issue of Jehovah’s vindication is the basis for such separation. In order to be separated, people must be acquainted with the issue through the preaching work.—Rom. 10: 13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 Pioneering has a direct relationship to the issue and the doing of God’s will. It is not God’s will that men perish, but that they become acquainted with accurate knowledge and gain everlasting life; hence God has lovingly and graciously provided this period of time for preaching in order that some may be saved. (Ezek. 18: 32; 2 Pet. 3:9) The more time spent preaching the more people are given the opportunity to hear the message of good news and get saved. The more persons responding favorably and dedicating themselves to Jehovah, the more will be making known God’s name, vindicating it and supporting the most important issue of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 Since 1914 Jehovah has taken his power and has begun ruling. This marked the beginning of a judgment period, which period ends at Armageddon. It is during this period of judgment that all persons are on trial, tested as to their faith and devotion to God. Jesus said: “Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.” (John 3: 19) It is clearly seen, then, that light on God’s Word must be made available so that men of goodwill can learn the way that leads to life and be judged favorably. Such judgment is based on each one’s works. Jehovah foretold at Psalm 110: 3 that many would willingly offer themselves in the day of his power: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force. In the splendors of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, you have your company of young men just like dewdrops.” Furthermore, he declared that he would raise up witnesses as prophets to declare to the nations his judgment. (Jer. 44: 4) Knowing the basis for judgment and having heard the message, they see the need for offering themselves willingly in the day of the manifestation of his great power. Their course of action is similar to that taken by the Israelites when Moses asked for materials to build the tabernacle. Exodus 35: 29 tells us that those “whose hearts incited them” brought such voluntary offerings in abundance. They recognized the need and responded promptly and favorably. Many today likewise see the need and offer themselves willingly in the day of Jehovah’s power. Their hearts incite them to do as much as possible in Jehovah’s service, serving as pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 Living during this period of time and in view of the important issues, none of mankind can escape being judged. Each one of us is under test as to his love and devotion to God. The majority of mankind have not responded favorably. They do not offer themselves willingly in support of the issue, but remain apathetic and indifferent toward the preaching of this .good news of the Kingdom. A great crowd, however, have manifested their love and devotion to God and have presented their bodies and what they have before Jehovah for use in his service. In the United States, October’s field service report shows 274,679 total publishers reporting. Of these 694 are special pioneers, 7,312 are regular pioneers and 2,982 are vacation pioneers. This represents 4 percent of the total publishers reporting, yet the potential exists for many more to become pioneers. Could more of the remaining 263,691 congregation publishers who know the basis for judgment and have heard the call become pioneers? The harvest indeed is great, but the workers, comparatively few. Why? Has the apathy of this world influenced some of us? Jesus foretold at Matthew 24: 12 that “the love of the greater number will cool off.” The majority of professed Christians today prove to be of this class. However, the outcome of this test of love and willingness as applied to you depends upon your course of action and your response to the issue. The works performed by you indicate the depth of your love. Guard against complacency and the danger of becoming part of this worldly-minded, unloving class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■&gt; The September, 1962, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> shows that of all the publishers in the United States about 24 percent are between the ages of sixteen and thirty. It also revealed that there are 30 percent between the ages of thirty-one and fifty and 18 percent between the ages of fifty-one and seventy. The question that comes to the fore is, Why are not more pioneering? Many are favorably situated in life so that they could pioneer. With others, it would require certain adjustments in order to pioneer. It is true, not all can pioneer, but it is certain that considerably more can lend themselves more fully in support of the issue in the day of Jehovah’s power, willingly offering themselves as pioneer ministers. If it is not possible for you to be a regular pioneer now, could you be in the vacation pioneer work at least once a year? Thousands tasted the joys of this service during the past service year and are deeply grateful for the enriched spirituality and greater appreciation they now have as a result of being vacation pioneers. Can you arrange your affairs to be one soon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">e This judgment period will soon see its end. The time left for preaching is reduced. World events in fulfillment of Bible prophecy indicate that soon Jehovah’s executional forces will go forward, destroying His enemies and completely vindicating His name. Now is the time to give careful scrutiny to your situation in life. How are you individually responding to the call for more regular or vacation pioneers? Are you indifferent, apathetic to the call? Are you offering yourself willingly in this day of Jehovah’s power? Are you able to be a regular or vacation pioneer, but have not taken steps to do so? If so, carefully consider your responsibility. Do not be like the five foolish ones among the ten virgins mentioned by Jesus at Matthew 25: 1-12: “Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet. For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them.” The five foolish ones looked indifferently on their assignments, did not see the need to equip their receptacles for use. They did not acknowledge the lateness of the time nor appreciate their responsibilities. They knew what was required of them, but failed. And when they came to their senses they were too late. Appreciate your opportunities now while there is yet time and offer yourself willingly as a regular or vacation pioneer in the day of Jehovah’s power.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PIONEERING—AN EXPRESSION OF IOVE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">more fully in Jehovah’s service. This is the way it should be and is the logical outcome of his dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 In fulfillment of Jesus’ dedication he manifested great love for his heavenly Father and a sincere desire to do God’s will. This was foretold at Psalm 40: 7-9: “In view of that, I said: ‘Here I have come, in the roll of the book it being written about me. To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts. I have told the good news of righteousness in the big congregation. Look! My lips I do not restrain.’ ” Because of his great love for his Father, he served from his heart, for it is stated that the law was within his inward parts. As a result of such heartfelt devotion, his lips he could not restrain. Pioneering is indeed an appropriate and full expression of this kind of love and devotion to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 Having heard the message of good news and dedicated your life to do Jehovah’s will, are you doing it? Are you offering yourself willingly and from the heart, doing as much as you possibly can in Jehovah’s service, as an outward expression of your love for God and neighbor? It is this kind of love that Jesus says fulfills God’s perfect kingly law and is the greatest commandment: “ ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He said to him: ‘ “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this, “You. must love your neighbor as yourself.” On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets?”—Matt. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">22: </span><span class="font0">36-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 There are many persons in the world who make great sacrifices and are motivated by an unselfish spirit in behalf of their fellowman. Many of their efforts can be said to be noble and helpful, but all of them are limited in their benefits. If such spirit is .manifested in worldly people, how much more should those dedicated ones of the New World society who know their God and the basis for judgment serve unselfishly as pioneers, making this their career in life? For truly, through such work, one is praising God and blessing man by making the way of life more accessible to persons of goodwill. Could any one of us choose a more beneficial and rewarding career in these critical pre-Armageddon days? Indeed, pioneering is an unselfish display of neighbor love and it is a fulfillment of the greatest commandment, which calls for wholehearted love of God. Such a course prevents a person from misplacing or misdirecting his love and insures his doing God’s will, as stated in 1 John 2: 15-17: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 Pioneering shows that one has an increased interest in God’s cause: “For this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” (1 John 5: 3) God has commanded that this good news of the Kingdom be preached, and the extent to which we serve God as preachers gives an indication of the depth of our love for God. Devoting one's life to God as a pioneer manifests an increased expression of true neighbor love as well, because you bring a message of life everlasting<sup>:</sup> to those who hear you. And showing that this love was to be deep-seated, motivating a person to expend his full energy in behalf of Jehovah and his neighbor, Mark 12:33 states: “This loving him with one’s whole heart and with one’s whole understanding and with one’s whole strength and this loving one’s neighbor as oneself is worth far more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">c How much love do you display? Having dedicated yourself to Jehovah, having learned of his marvelous works in this day of his great power, have you been moved to support God’s cause? Are you reaching the quota of ten hours a month as a congregation publisher? Could you make a fuller expression of your love for God and neighbor by becoming a regular pioneer? Even if after careful scrutiny of your situation you may feel you cannot engage in the regular pioneer work, then can you serve during the course of the year as a vacation pioneer? Would not this be an appropriate demonstration of youx’ greater love for God and neighbor? It is a known fact that the majority of those that are appointed to the regular pioneer service have first tasted of this joyful activity as vacation pioneers. It increases their appreciation and love for Jehovah, his organization and their neighbors. It increases their faith and confidence and impels them to do more in Jehovah’s service, increasing it, making a greater demonstration of their love. Even if one finds he cannot serve as a regular pioneer, his vacation pioneer service has increased his love for God and enabled him to be a much better and more effective congregation publisher because of having spent more time in the ministry. He becomes more efficient as a congregation publisher, more qualified to teach, makes better back-calls and conducts more progressive Bible studies. So why not be a better congregation publisher by tasting of the vacation pioneer service if you cannot serve as a regular pioneer? Would not this be an excellent means of demonstrating your love for God and neighbor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 There is no doubt about it, the full-time ministry is the most important work today, not only because of its lifesaving benefits, but because it is God’s will for us to engage in such divine work to the fullest extent possible. Recognize its importance. Be convinced of this and seek to cultivate greater love for God and neighbor. Having done so, you will be in a better position to increase your privileges of service. What steps you must take thereafter to become a pioneer will be considered in the following articles.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CULTIVATING THE PIONEER SPIRIT AT HEART</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">i If you are among those who have been thinking about pioneering but have never been able to enter this work, perhaps this discussion will help you realize the goal. There are many things that must be done before a person becomes a pioneer, but we will first consider some of the major steps that you must take in order to realize this blessed privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 First, it is necessary to have, not only an understanding of the issue facing mankind, but an appreciation of your individual responsibility in connection therewith. You may recognize that the Kingdom is established, that Jehovah is now reigning and that this system of things will soon be destroyed. This is fine. But do you understand your responsibility as a dedicated one in connection with this issue? Do you individually see the need for rendering service to God to the extent possible in your individual case? This is the most important step toward realizing the pioneer ministry. To hold back from pioneering, reasoning that a congregation publisher will enter into the new world as well as a pioneer, does not show maturity. Why? Because such holding back runs counter to Jesus’ instruction to love Jehovah with our whole heart, soul and mind and our neighbor as ourselves. This view approaches the matter negatively rather than positively. It restricts one’s blessings at the hand of Jehovah. It minimizes one’s opportunities for expanding his ministry of praise. Moreover, it may be that another publisher is not situated so as to be able to serve as a pioneer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">but perhaps you are!</span><span class="font0"> Hence it is necessary to cultivate a positive approach to matters as you study God’s Word. Negative thinking with respect to your individual responsibility is not an expression of love; it is selfish and could blind you to the joy and blessings of the pioneer ministry. Hence, it is not only a matter of seeing the importance of the issue, but nourishing wholesome thoughts in that right direction. Daily prayer and constant study are of considerable aid as you individually cooperate with your desires. In short, it is essential to have the pioneer spirit at heart and recognize your individual responsibility and Scriptural obligations. Thus, you should not curtail your service because of making comparison with another in the New World society. Each one has different responsibilities and obligations and stands individually before his Creator for judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 Since this is true, it is important for each one to examine his motives, pursuits and desires in life. Notice the power of desire as shown in its causing a Christian to sin, as pointed out at James 1: 14, 15. The desire is cultivated, nourished, and then realized. But it is a wrong desire that leads to death. Right desire, likewise, is powerful, for its influence is for good and is realized, by a person’s cultivating appreciation for the pioneer service, nourishing it, and taking positive steps to accomplish that goal. But it is more than thinking about it; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">you must want to pioneer, </span><span class="font0">that is, you must want to give more attention to your ministry. Hence, in order to realize this, you cultivate positive thoughts in that direction. Do not allow a negative view of matters to postpone the realization of this blessed privilege of service. Do not be like the many invitees of Jesus’ illustration at Luke 14: 16-24 who begged off from attending the evening meal prepared for them. One bought a field and had to see it. Another had to examine some cattle purchased. Still another just married and could not come. When compared to the event at the evening meal, none of the reasons were of sufficient importance to decline, and in all cases it was their acquired possessions that prevented favorable response. Sci'Utinize your status, your obligations and acquired interests. Are they valid reasons for your not responding to the call for more pioneers? Recognize your Scriptural responsibilities and allow the pioneer spirit to spring out of your heart, motivating you to reach out for this grand privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 The cultivating of a positive approach to matters allows one to place first things first, and in this case it is the pioneer ministry. This is in harmony with Matthew 6: 33, where Jesus shows that the Kingdom is to be sought first. Since pioneering is full-time Kingdom preaching, it should be placed first in our lives, allowing “other things” to be secondary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0"> God individually expects of us only what we can do according to our respective situation in life, but more is required of some than of others. Please note how this point is made in the illustration of the talents at Matthew 25: 14-23. The account shows that after the master summoned his slaves in order to commit to them his belongings he gave the talents “to each one according to his own ability.” The fact that certain ones are said, to have “ability” does not mean that others do not. All had ability in varying degrees. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font0"> have the “ability” to increase Kingdom interests. Though some may have special skills, greater mental abilities, exceptional aptitude or endowments, all can show an increase in the Kingdom interests, the talents, entrusted to them. But some are entrusted with more responsibility, and theirs is an especially happy lot if they appreciate the privileges that are theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6 A person who has the pioneer spirit at heart not only sees the issue and need, but feels personally obligated to increase his service if he is so situated that he can do so. Notice too that the talents, or interests, are initially given by the master, not according to another’s ability, but according to each one’s “own ability” or situation in life. Hence, expectations of service, proportionate to their respective “abilities.” are greater respecting some than others. One who has the pioneer spirit at heart has a sense of responsibility to his God to make full expression of his unselfish devotion. He recognizes his Scriptural obligation, because, after scrutiny, he sees that he has the “ability” to do so. Thus, he does not compare himself with others in the New World society who may not have the “ability” or who are not situated so they can pioneer but who, for their faithful service, will also gain life everlasting in God’s new world. Nevertheless. many of these who cannot serve as regular pioneers find great joy in serving Jehovah from time to time during the course of the year in the vacation pioneer service, thus proportionately increasing their “talents,” and they maintain excellent averages as congregation publishers during the remainder of the year. Certainly even these, it can be said, have the pioneer spirit at heart. (See Matthew 13: 23.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 Notice the elevated view of matters and the pioneer spirit of one publisher afflicted with a serious illness limiting her life-span to about two more years. This is the way she put it in a letter to the Society: “Since publishers put in ten hours a month for Jehovah, I figured that if I could spend one year of the two as a pioneer I would be living ten years instead of one foi' Jehovah. This I have done and more.” Would you say she wanted to serve Jehovah with her “whole heart” and thus had the pioneer spirit at heart.? What a commendable example! Does not this indicate supreme love and devotion to Jehovah and a sense of responsibility to do as much as possible in behalf of the Kingdom issue? Have you scrutinized your individual status in life? What is preventing you from pioneering? Are your obligations and responsibilities Scriptural, or are they only assumed to be so by you? If they are Scriptural, do they actually prevent you from pioneering? Have you done more than think about pioneering? Do you really want to pioneer? Is that your heartfelt desire? ,Lf so, do you actually have the “ability” or are you situated so that you can serve as a regular pioneer but lack the positive approach to matters? Take it to Jehovah in prayer and begin now to make definite plans to serve as a pioneer. The next article will help you make such plans.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HOW TO BECOME A PIONEER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">J If you have a desire to take a trip for two weeks or so, how will you realize the fulfillment of this desire? Will it be by only hoping for this vacation? No. You plan. You may plan many months out of the year for a vacation. You do so mainly in two ways. You save money and you make time for your vacation. During the course of the year you may reduce' your financial obligations, saving on food, clothing and other things of life. Why? Because you want to realize your desire. Not only this, but you plan your trip. You plan on the date, the destination, the route to follow and the things to take. In principle this is the course to follow if you want to become a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">•2 First of all, take the matter to Jehovah in prayer. Ask him for wisdom and understanding to help you make plans to pioneer. Seek the aid of his spirit by cooperating with it in your life. But as you ask, do so without doubting. Approach God with a sincere desire in your heart to realize the pioneer ministry and feel confident that he will help you accomplish your goal, just as James assures at James 1: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 After you have followed such a course of prayer to Jehovah, cultivating wisdom to see your way to pioneer, begin to plAn and cooperate with your heart’s desire. First, scrutinize your situation in life. “Sit down and calculate” matters, as Jesus advises at Luke 14: 28, 31. Consider the many things that you feel prevent you from pioneering. List them for consideration and then examine them, one by one. Keep in mind that, although you may have many obstacles and responsibilities now, it may be possible progressively to make adjustments in your life and arrange your affairs in order to pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 This brings to mind the importance of reducing other interests in life as much as possible, thus overcoming var-ous barriers and attaining the goal of being a pioneer. It takes careful planning in order to make time for the allimportant pioneer work. Many of life’s pursuits can be reduced or eliminated completely in order to make room for the pioneer ministry. Thus you are reducing your individual interests to make room for the interests of greater importance in life. A careful survey of those on the pioneer list shows that, in the case of many, it was their negative approach to matters that prevented them from engaging in the regular pioneer service </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">earlier.</span><span class="font0"> We ourselves are often our greatest enemies, so to speak. Do you let your uncertainties, fears and lack of confidence prevent you from taking this forward step? Start first of all with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">yourself and your mental approach</span><span class="font0"> to problems and begin to consider what could be done to adjust matters in order to enter the pioneer ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 How can I pioneer and care for my financial obligations? This is, perhaps, the biggest question of all. Many regular pioneers on the list now will tell you that they themselves made this molehill into a mountain. It is true that some who pioneered found it necessary to leave the pioneer ranks because of financial obligations. But it is also true that in many of such cases, though certainly not in all, it was found to be lack of careful management and personal organization. Though reducing expenses is necessary, one should not look at pioneering as an undesirable lite of such great sacrifices that it places you on a starvation diet and requires that you lead an ascetic life of self-denial. Ask the pioneers in your congregation or your circuit how Jehovah provides; they will tell you. Also, did not David say: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread”? (Ps. 37: 25) Jesus gives assurance of reasonable provisions of food and clothing for those “seeking first the kingdom.” (Matt. 6:25-34) These are no promises of miraculous provisions. As in anything else, it will require good management of your affairs, scheduling your daily affairs and budgeting your income and expenses. It will also require initiative and industriousness on your part. This is necessary for any enterprise to be successful. It may be that you have to give more serious consideration to Paul’s words at 1 Timothy 6: 6-10: “To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency. For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">« By far the majority on the pioneer list are very successful, because they are good managers of their affairs. However, some look at the pioneer ministry as if they must devote the month wholly to the service. This is not the case, for the quota is only 100 hours a month, thus leaving 620 hours in each month for secular work and other pursuits. Brothers who do </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">seasonal work</span><span class="font0"> may be able to spend three or four months on secular work and still succeed in devoting at least 1,200 hours to field service in twelve months, thereby through careful planning reaching the annual pioneer quota. Nevertheless, some pioneers leave the ranks, not because the quota is too high, but in many cases because of poor management of their time and affairs, being disorganized and having poor foresight. Good personal organization and following a well-arranged schedule make attainment of the quotas much easier, allowing sufficient time to care for your other needs and obligations during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 Is an automobile necessary for one to engage in the pioneer ministry? No. While a car may be an advantage and is certainly very helpful to carry on one’s ministry in certain territories, the Society does not feel that a car is essential. One pioneer, seventy-three years old, lives out in rural territory and yet has been carrying on a very effective pioneer ministry for many years on foot. There are many others well up in years in similar positions, and yet they find great joy in continuing their pioneer ministry without the regular use of a car. If one is financially able to care for a car, he may find it useful, but in many cases a car can be a financial burden and a hindrance to one’s carrying on his pioneer ministry. In the majority of cases, if a pioneer is organized and concentrates his activity in a portion of the territory and schedules some days to work with congregation publishers who have cars, he will find that he can serve effectively without the financial burden of an automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8 With others it is the problem of health. Will my health allow me to pioneer? This question is asked by many. While health prevented many from entering the pioneer ministry for a time, they realized that, with good personal organization, maintaining a balance in all things, they would be able to carry on in the pioneer ministry without difficulty. By arranging a good daily schedule that reduces other interests and allows for more periods of rest, they have been successful pioneers for many years. Very often pioneers not in the best of health have realized the benefits spoken about at Proverbs 17: 22: “A heart that is joyful does good as a curer, but a spirit that is stricken makes the bones dry.” Yes, joyful hearts, sustained by the blessings of the pioneer ministry, have kept many a faithful pioneer pushing ahead even though not in the best of physical health. And you will be interested to know that there are several pioneers performing an above-average ministry though they are totally blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9 What about my family obligations? There are many pioneers on the list with families. One sister, a mother of five children, has a husband who cooperates, as do the children, and she does excellently in the pioneer ministry. Another pioneer sister has six children, some of school age, but her family cooperates fully, some of them engaging in the vacation pioneer ministry. Still others have no children, but the husband and wife cooperate by one or the other pioneering, and in many cases both are pioneers, maintaining a good schedule, one that is practical and effective. Many with unbelieving mates are able to pioneer. No matter what your particular status in life may be, there are hundreds of similar living examples of pioneers on the list now to show that it can be done if one has the pioneer spirit at heart. Certainly this should cause single persons to give sober consideration to their unencumbered state. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What is preventing you from pioneering?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 After you have given careful scrutiny to your circumstances in harmony with the above, concern yourself with the pre-entrance requirements for the pioneer ministry. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font0"> page 18, paragraph 60, states: “This privilege of service is open to all regular publishers who have been preaching the good news of the Kingdom for at least six months since the date of their immersion, have averaged twelve hours, nine back-calls and one home Bible study a month for the past six months, and they should have a favorable recommendation from the local congregation.” Why not give serious consideration to adjusting your affairs in order to become a regular pioneer now? Talk it over with some of the mature brothers who have the pioneer spirit at heart. Talk to successful pioneers and see how they carry on their ministry. Then fill out an application immediately when you meet the pre-entrance requirements. Doing so, you will be greatly blessed. Remember, even if you cannot be a regular pioneer at the present time, try to be a vacation pioneer as soon as possible. This will be a step in the right direction. It will build your confidence and enable you to get actual experience as a pioneer. It will be an effective way to organize your time and affairs to become a regular pioneer. You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain. For the many benefits derived from pioneering, consider the next article.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>BENEFITS FROM PIONEERING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">1 There are many benefits from serving in the pioneer work, morally, physically and spiritually. It is indeed a source of contentment to know that you have responded favorably to the call for more pioneers in full support of the issue. This in itself provides comfort and adds to your contentment. Knowing that you have given your all to Jehovah in dedication and are now earnestly translating such into the fulltime pioneer ministry gives you a sublime source of satisfaction. Being every day in Jehovah’s service brings the greatest joy and happiness. At the end of the day a person can look back and thank Jehovah in prayer for the opportunity of being used by him in the pioneer ministry. In prayer to God you can express appreciation for the many blessings you received during the day and for the opportunity of having a direct part in sanctifying his name. What a wonderful way to complete a day! Would you not enjoy this satisfaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 Pioneering does more than this, because it helps you morally. Constantly you are busy in Jehovah’s service, thinking about spiritual things, rendering service to persons of goodwill and not allowing yourself to become occupied with the affairs of this world. What a wholesome force for good this can be! The pioneer ministry is one way of “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” being occupied daily in the work that will preserve you through this world of wickedness. (1 Cor. 15: 58) Living in this system of things, with its lawlessness and its evil deeds, the Christian must be constantly on guard against such. He must never compromise Christian princioles, but always avoid dangerous, worldly associations. What better way is there to accomplish this than to serve as a pioneer! Your whole life is truly devoted to Jehovah God, daily engaging in his service, offering up praises, talking about his Word, filling your mind with wholesome thoughts, and directing you on a safe course in an ungodly world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3 As Jehovah’s people carry on their ministerial work in this system of things, greater- demands will be heaped upon them. As </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font0"> near the battle of Armageddon Gog’s attack will certainly be felt by each member of the New World society, as Gog resents our spiritual prosperity. Events of the day indicate its near approach. (Ezek. 38) There is no doubt that what will be needed then as never before will be strong faith and maturity. Will you have such then? Will you be strong enough to overcome the many trials and tests that will be brought against you and all Jehovah’s people? Too often, individuals learn the truth, are happy to receive it, dedicate their lives to Jehovah as publishers, but make little or no further advancement in the organization. These are described by Paul at Hebrews 5:12-14. What advancement have you made since your dedication? In order to press on to maturity, strongly rooted within the confines of the New World society, it is necessary that you advance in Jehovah’s organization, seeing and assuming your responsibilities and privileges of service. The pioneer ministry may be for you and may turn out to mean the difference between life and death. So press on to maturity by considering your particular status and see if you can engage in the pioneer ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 In addition to maturity, pioneering builds your faith. Do you feel you lack in faith? Is this preventing you from serving as a pioneer? Then, as encouraged by Paul at Hebrews 12: 1: “Let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.” Do not allow the attractions of the world, the materialistic philosophy of life, to draw you away and retard your spiritual progress. “Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God.” (Heb. 3: 12) If you lack sufficient faith now, build on it, become strong in the organization by the study of God’s Word, by attending meetings, and by regularly engaging in the ministry. Strengthen and insure that faith by engaging in the regular pioneer work, or the vacation pioneer ministry, whatever your situation will allow right now. Thus when Jehovah’s people are attacked from the far north, you will be certain to be strong and firm in your devotion to God. Your faith and maturity will carry you through the test as you serve courageously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 In addition to the above, the pioneer service increases your appreciation for Jehovah’s organization and your attachment to it and places you in position for added privileges of service. You will be encouraged to cultivate a greater sense of responsibility, reaching out for greater privileges of service in the Christian congregation. The report of the 1962 service year showed a peak of 989,192 publishers, of whom 6,934 were special pioneers and missionaries working every month, an increase of 557 for the year. Regular pioneers numbered 26,626, a new alltime peak and an increase of 3,159 in one year. Thus brothers and sisters in full-time preaching work averaged 33,560 around the world. As the organization continues to grow, there is a greater need for capable brothers and sisters in the organization to be used for additional privileges of service. Are you responding to this? (1 Tim. 3: 1) Among the ways to reach out for this fine work is to be a pioneer and make yourself available for such privileges of service. It is the privilege of pioneers to teach and train others, not only the Bible students with whom they study, but publishers in the congregation who need help, encouragement and training. Many congregations are in dire need of pioneer assistance and there is an urgent need for pioneers to go into isolated areas to serve where the need is great. Can you arrange your affairs to increase your privileges of service and perhaps become a special pioneer in due time? What a wonderful privilege! Perhaps other privileges of service such as missionary service, circuit work or becoming a member of the Bethel family can be yours. What a wonderful outlook, what wonderful privileges are available as you reach out for them and serve in the pioneer ministry!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6 The many fine experiences you have each day as persons of goodwill respond favorably to the message you bring them and come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and dedicate themselves to God add to your joy. While as a congregation publisher you can have this joy; think how much more of it will be yours as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 In addition to this, Jehovah’s blessing will come in many forms as a result of your faithfulness, your devotion and your service to Jehovah. This is something that your heavenly Father knows you need. Not only that, but as a result of faithfully increasing your attention given to Kingdom interests, whether as a regular pioneer, a vacation pioneer or even by being a better congregation publisher, you will have much greater joy and blessings in God’s new world, in accord with the principle stated in these words: “Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”—Matt. 25: 23.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kingdom Hall—Part Three Dedication</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Just as King Solomon arranged for the public dedication of the temple upon its completion, so today it is appropriate for congregations that buy a hall or that build to have a special meeting for its dedication. To answer a number of inquiries that have been received and for the guidance of congregations building Kingdom Halls, some helpful, information is set out here.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Since the Society does not print dedication programs nor does it supply an outline for the dedication talk, it is up to each congregation to work up its own program and arrange for speakers. It is good to arrange for a special weekend of field service on the occasion of the dedication. Saturday morning and afternoon can be devoted to magazine service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Generally local newspapers have been very receptive to publishing pictures of Kingdom Halls that are being dedicated and will publish fine articles submitted by the congregation before and after the dedication. It is good to make known in any article printed beforehand that the public is invited to attend the dedication and to visit the hall during “Open House,” which many congregations arrange Saturday afternoon. Of course, all persons of goodwill should be personally invited to attend. Also, it would be good to give a witness in the entire area around the Kingdom Hall, inviting the neighbors to visit the new Kingdom Hall in their community. Then a few friendly publishers can be assigned to greet the neighbors and others who come to see the new building.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When the dedication program is scheduled for Saturday night, nearby congregations that are invited to attend (some of whom may have assisted in the construction work) may do so without interference with their own local activities. However, congregations that are being served by the circuit servant or that have other meetings scheduled for Saturday evening should not disrupt their own activities to attend the dedication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As for the program, each congregation may arrange it to suit local circumstances. Many congregations have followed a program similar to the one set forth below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Songs and experiences dealing with the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20-min. talk: History of the congregation. This talk covers points re-</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">garding the congregation, such as when it was started, how It has grown, and so forth, bringing the account to the point where a new Kingdom Hall was needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20-min. or so: Highlights of Kingdom Hall construction. This talk may utilize slides or movies of construction if such have been taken. Cover interesting points in connection with the building of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">1 hour: The Dedication Talk. This talk, handled by a mature brother, will include comments on the purpose of the Kingdom Hall, its place and use in true worship, and the part all publishers have in making it the most important building in the community. Congregations that desire to have light refreshments on this occasion may do so; it is a very special occasion held only one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> AU publishers should be encouraged to support field service Sunday morning. A meeting for field service can be held at the Kingdom Hall. Sunday afternoon or evening one of the Society’s regular public talks will be scheduled, to be followed by the regular study of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine. If a guest speaker is with the congregation, fifteen minutes may be devoted to concluding comments by him, or the congregation servant may wish to use that time to mention a few of the high points of the special weekend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN OCTOBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Held: 24,039</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES QUOTA FOR 1963 294,180 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A new peak of subscriptions’ Yes, in October we obtained 176,349 new subscriptions, surpassing the previous high of October, 1959, and last October’s 158,351. Excellent indeed, brothers’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The entire report was very fine. Publisher’s again averaged over ten hours. Have you individually reached this goal yet? Remember, having a practical weekly schedule is the key to your quota in hours. Commendably, special pioneers averaged 155.8 magazines, regular pioneers 118.3, vacation pioneers 92.2, and congregation publishers 12.9. Additionally, we had a new peak in pioneers, increasing from September’s high of 7,154 up to 7,312. And, we had just short of 3,000 vacation pioneers for the month’ Hopefully pointing to future expansion is the increase in Bible studies. From September’s 200,188 we went up to 209,406. Remember, December is the month for our 10-percent increase.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Directing Interested Ones to the Organization</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How often those of us who conduct studies have thought, Wouldn’t it be helpful if we had an outline of points about the organization to discuss week by week after our home Bible studies? Now we have it—in the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> in the articles “Biblebased Society of Kingdom Witnesses” and “Preaching in All the Inhabited Earth.” Have you used it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In preparing these informative presentations designed to enhance the appreciation of newly interested ones for the organization, we should keep in mind that not all persons progress at the same rate, so it is wise for us to be flexible. In some cases you may want to stay with a certain point for several weeks in your brief after-study discussions. For example, if you invite a person to the congregation book study, but he does not come, you may want to take up the matter again in a tactful way until you get results, instead of going on to a discussion of other meetings in simply a routine manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> On some subjects covered in those </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> articles you will find many scriptures cited. You do not have to discuss them all. Select a few and use them well. Then if you feel that it would be advantageous to continue on that same subject the next week, use some of the other texts provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> You will also find it helpful to use these visual aids: For example, when you tell them about the public meeting take along handbills. For service meetings, show them </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> In discussing conventions, why not use a convention report? And when_ encouraging home worship, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font11"> will help you to demonstrate your point. In some cases you may want to discuss the scriptures on a subject one week, and then next week bring along something else to show' them—whether it is the book being studied at the congregation book study, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> lesson for the week, or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry</span><span class="font11"> inserts that help you in preparing your ministry school talks —and use this as a basis for further discussion on the same subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> From this it can be seen that the material outlined in these </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> articles might be covered in six months in after-study discussions, or it might be expanded into a program covering more than a year. Be sure to save this issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> with your service equipment and use it well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Using John 17:3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> December presents another opportunity to place the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New, World Translation of the, Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font11">with persons of goodwill in our territories. Simplified sermons have found an important place in the witnessing of new and less experienced publishers. Experienced publishers, too, make good use of them when busy persons are met. Simplicity in both wording and thought is the keynote in the use of these, as shown in the following examples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup>-“Good morning. My name is ----. I am calling briefly on those who have respect for the Bible and would like to understand it better. One of the rewards held out to those who have this right viewpoint is mentioned at John 17: 3, where it says, [read John 17:3], Taking in this knowledge of God and Jesus Christ is much easier when you read the Bible in the English that we speak today. This was one of the reasons why the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font11">was produced. You may have it,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Courageous Through Faith </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd) </span><span class="font11">a 1 O-percent, increase in December? That’s right. Our quota is 294,180 publishers in the field service during December, and there are 297,129 cards in the congregation files. So the goal is within reach, but it is going to require diligent effort. All these publishers want to have a share in the preaching work; that is why their cards are in the file. But many are new or are faced with various problems. They need our encouragement. Let’s see that they get it. Make it your goal to be out in the service and report by December 16, and at the same time make arrangements to take along the new and irregular ones. The assistant congregation servant will follow through by giving lists of those needing assistance to the study conductors each week. With united effort we can </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> have a courageous share in the ministry during December. Make that the goal of your service center; make it the goal of your congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> There are others too who should be ready to join us in the service —-those with whom we study. Havalong with this printed sermon, on a contribution of $1.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> “Hello. My name is--. My</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">purpose in calling is to encourage Bible reading. Sometimes we hear the question asked, Why read the Bible? People read it for different reasons. One of the best reasons for doing so is given here at John 17: 3, where it says, [read John 17:3]. But no matter what your reason for reading the Bible is, you will find it easier by reading the .Vew </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </span><span class="font11">It is in modern language and is the result of over ten years of research. It is yours for a contribution of $1, and this printed Bible sermon is given free.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Although these one-scripture sermons are greatly simplified, we will still want to prepare and rehearse carefully. Parents will want to assist their children beforehand so that they will be ready well in advance. We can give newer publishers assistance and encouragement too. Then all will be eager to have a full share in distributing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> in December.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">ing used the suggestions in the November </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kinydom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> to prepare them, we should be able to make definite arrangements to start many of them in the service during December. Help them to learn the simplified sermon or a magazine presentation and then lovingly take them along with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> No doubt, some of these new ones, having abandoned the world's Christmas celebration, would enjoy doing something on that day that really will bring praise to God. Do not wait until December 25 to take them along in service, but, if possible, include that day. Each congregation should arrange for field service on December 25, both morning and afternoon to make it convenient for all publishers. Either the Bible or magazines may be offered. Younger publishers on vacation from school should be encouraged too through midweek service arrangements to use some time each day in the ministry. Now, while we still have the opportunity, is the time to take advantage of every opportunity to share courageously in the ministry.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>DRAW ATTENTION TO GOD'S WORKS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The reason that we are qualified to be Jehovah’s witnesses is that we have been taught by Jehovah. And we know that when we succeed in helping others to accept teaching from Jehovah they too will want to worship him. So in our witnessing we draw attention to his works: the awe-inspiring physical creation, his Word the Bible, his visible organization of witnesses, and his kingdom. Along with our Bible sermons, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is one of the main instruments by which we do this. It is the means by which many have come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How are we doing with the placement of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions, which is one of our big assignments from January through April ? Well, look at the subscription chart in the Kingdom Hall and see. Has the congregation met one-fourth of its four-month quota yet? To a large extent that depends on us as individuals. Of course, to place subscriptions we have to be out in the j </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR FEBRUARY </span><span class="font11">i </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">| Subscription for “The Watchtower,” | 4 with three booklets, for $1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">service. If we are out regularly each week, or at least ten hours each month, we are very likely going to place subscriptions. True, in many parts of the country it is very cold in February, but that does not need to stop us if we dress for it. If people can get out to do secular work, we can surely get out to do our Father’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To get results, though, takes something in addition to time. We have to be prepared. We have to know our sermon well, and to that end it is a good thing to practice with other members of our family and our companions in service. Then, too, on Sunday morning it helps us all when the book study conductor arranges to review the sermon or have it demonstrated just before we get into the service. It is good to do this at least every other week. On the other weeks we can discuss together commonly met objections, drawing good ideas from</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>increasing Time</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each one of us as a dedicated Christian has the responsibility before Jehovah to preach the good news of the Kingdom. As we all know, it takes time, but we are thankful that someone spent time to bring the good news to us and give us the wonderful hope of God’s new world, and now it is our desire to do the same for others. We all want to devote time to doing God’s work, increasing that time if possible, because we appreciate how important it is.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> No doubt, by now you have read the article in the January 1 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> that gives a summary of our ministerial activity throughout the world for the past year. It made us all happy to see that in the United States we had an increase of 16,049 publishers, making an average of 248,681 for the year. All together, we spent 37,232,859 hours in active preaching during the year, which is an increase of 752,169 over the previous year. But as we all noticed, the average hours for congregation publishers dropped, and in the United States it was from 9.9 hours down to 9.6. Hours for regular and special pioneers also dropped. Since this indicates an actual decrease in the amount of preaching that we individually are doing, it is of serious concern to all of us.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Another important factor is being really enthusiastic about </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Do not hesitate to tell people how much you have personally benefited from it, and be ready to show them portions of the current issue that you feel will stir </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font11"> 3)</span></p></li></ul>

Is it among the 1,738 congregations that average ten hours or more each month? This is commendable, and we encourage you brothers to keep up the good work. What about the 1,891 congregations that average between eight and ten hours? With a little extra effort on your part, you can easily move into the ten-hours-or-more bracket. That would be wonderful.

<p><span class="font0">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: Talk on “Instruction by Attention to God’s Works.” (See “Watchtower,” August 15, 1961, pp. 489-495, and February 1, 1962, p. 94.) 15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article “Draw Attention to God’s Works.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN FEBRUARY 5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">18 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Increasing Time for God’s Work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">22 min: Jehovah’s Witnesses—Qualified Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Our goal as teachers is regularly to conduct at least one Bible study. Use of the new sermon on Jehovah’s witnesses has stimulated considerable interest that can be developed into studies. Preparation and use of a good back-call sermon will be most helpful in achieving this goal. (See “Sermon Outlines,” subject 28, theme C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: Jehovah’s Witnesses—Qualified Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No formal religious training needed to teaeh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 7:15, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Chairman discusses following suggested presentation with audience: ‘Hello, Mr.----. I’ve been anxious to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">talk to you again since my last visit when we discussed some interesting Scriptural facts about Jehovah’s witnesses. As I explained previously, the main purpose of our work is to acquaint others with the good news about God’s kingdom. Our worldwide witnessing activities have stimulated thousands to study the Bible and learn of Jehovah God’s purposes. We engage in this educational work because Jesus instructed all his followers to learn the truth and then share it with others. No formal training in a religious school is necessary to accomplish this. (John 7:15, 16) The apostle Paul showed it was results of ministry, not letters from men, that proved qualifications to teach God’s Word. (2 Cor. 3:1-3) Having confidence that the Bible is inspired of God, Jehovah’s witnesses study it, live by it and teach it to others. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) As ministers we are very much interested in helping others build up their confidence in the Bible and increase their knowledge of it. My visit to your home this evening is to share with you some of the things that I’ve learned from the Bible about God’s promises to establish lasting peace on the earth. In view of present world conditions, that would be a welcome change, wouldn’t it? For example, here are some of the questions that we have found answers to in the course of our study. [Read page 3, paragraph 1, “Good News” booklet.] I’m sure you would be glad to know what the Bible counsel offered by “Mature.” After seeing his deficiency on points just discussed, “No Sub” says he will properly prepare to give effective sermon and arrange to spend ten hours in service during month. Would now like help to make transition to present subscription effectively. “Mature” explains first essential is to be familiar with an article that has a specific point that ties in with sermon theme. Some other helpful points: “Watchtower” sees world happenings in light of Scriptures; largest circulation of any religious magazine in world, printed in 62 languages; many brief but thought-provoking articles for busy people; “Questions from Readers” deals with questions received from subscribers, etc. “No Sub” is glad for suggestions. Next would like to know how this is done. (See January “Kingdom Ministry,” “Your Service Meeting.”) “No Sub” is enthusiastic over prospects of applying suggestions, obtaining subscriptions and starting studies. Will prepare properly. “Mature” invites him in service; definite arrangements made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE II (6 min.) Demonstration showing “No Sub,” accompanied by “Mature,” making actual presentation to householder. Model sermon given, householder accepts subscription and “No Sub” starts study in “Good NewS” booklet.</span></p>

Summarize key points of demonstration to emphasize how each publisher can obtain at least two subscriptions during campaign. Encourage all to start studies wherever opportunity exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After brief discussion of the day’s text, the meeting will be devoted to a thorough discussion of the article “Circuit Servants to Give More Personal Assistance to Publishers.” Ask questions, as in a “Watchtower” study, and have a group of well-prepared servants and others on the platform answer and demonstrate the points. Other questions, as appropriate, may be directed to the audience. Read all paragraphs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">MODEL (10 min.) Competent publisher demonstrates sermon and starts study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Are you one of those presently not conducting a study? If so, we especially encourage you to support back-call night and the third hour on Sunday, using this sermon to call on those who have shown interest. If you have difficulty, do not hesitate to request help from more experienced publishers. If we faithfully follow through we can be sure of a full share in the joys of teaching new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include, remarks on the slogan, based on 1 Timothy 6:18, at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">15 min: Report from “Watchtower” study servant on visit with congregation servant. Offer suggestions for improving attendance and the need and value of private study in preparing for this congregation meeting. 20 min: How to Obtain Your Quota of Subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Discuss progress of campaign locally. Each publisher should have at least one subscription by now. Prospect for meeting congregation quota depends on how well each publisher does with personal quota. Thorough preparation of sermon material essential, as well as following Society’s suggestions for taking advantage of all available occasions to present offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SCENE I (9 min.) After close of weekly service meeting two publishers, “Mature” and “No Sub,” are discussing their individual progress toward reaching the subscription quota. “No Sub” dejectedly asks if he obtained any subscriptions. “Mature” happily replies he has two. “No Sub” asks, ‘How did you do it? I’ve tried but have none, and almost half of this campaign is gone.’ A spirited conversation is carried on as “Mature” analyzes what is lacking. When asked if he has prepared the new sermon, “No Sub” says he has it marked in his Bible but not well in mind. To question on whether he has definite schedule permitting him to spend time each week offering subscription, he answers he tries to get out at least once or twice during month. Meant to start out early in campaign, but other things came up; however, was out toward end of January. Appropriate</span></p>

There is no other magazine in the world that can do more to help them find happiness, security, even life itself, is there?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As we know, placing magazines and subscriptions is not our only objective. We are interested in people, and we want to turn them to the worship of Jehovah. That requires that we call back where we find interest. It is something that we should all take time to do every week, arranging to study with those who are willing. Not all will respond, but let us not miss any who are willing to be instructed by paying attention to God’s works. While there is still time to do it, let us all share fully in the work of witnessing that God has given us to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Circuit Servants to Give More Personal Assistance to Publishers</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Get a firm hold on the everlasting life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for which you were called”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Brothers, you will be interested to know that during the week of December 18-23, 1961, the Society’s president and the office servant at Brooklyn Bethel held four-hour meetings with all the circuit and district servants in nine different cities of the United States. What was said to these servants had to do with the lives of Jehovah’s dedicated people and how the circuit servants and district servants as shepherds of God’s flock could give greater help to the individual publishers of the congregations they serve. Circuit and district servants are now applying the suggestions made. Since the effectiveness and results of what was discussed depend not only on what circuit and district servants do, but also on the cooperation of all the servants in the congregation and the publishers and pioneers, the Society thought it would be good to tell you what was brought to the attention of these servants in these special meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“We, Though, Who Are Strong Ought to Bear the Weaknesses of Those Not Strong”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We all know that Jehovah has commanded us to preach the good news of God’s kingdom. Year by year more preaching is done, more territory is covered and therefore more individuals take up the preaching work. They dedicate their lives to serve Jehovah. But a greater responsibility rests upon shepherds than just gathering in sheeplike ones. There must be a growth in the maturity of each person dedicating his life to God. New ones who associate with the Society come into God’s flock as lambs, but they must grow up spiritually and be brought on to maturity as full-grown sheep. They must conform their lives to the life of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What did Paul mean when he said: “For, indeed, although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you . . . you have become such as need milk, not solid food. For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong”? (Heb. 5: 12-14) It appears from what Paul said that some of the lambs did not grow up. They did not become teachers. Shepherds have a responsibility, and the circuit and district servants and other mature servants in the congregation must feed these little lambs to help them grow up and ‘get acquainted with the word.’ Really, their lives are at stake if they are not properly cared for. Paul says: “But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ.” (Eph. 4: 15) Yes, the former lambs ought, by this time, to be full-grown teachers. They should be able ‘through use to have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.’ But today it appears that some have not done so, although they have the time to do so. How is it possible to learn to distinguish both right and wrong? Of course, the answer is, by studying God’s Word, the Bible. But people must also use the Bible, “speaking the truth,” and the best place to speak the truth is in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every circuit, district and congregation servant as well as every mature brother believes that a dedicated person wants to do the will of God. When the circuit servant checks the Publisher’s Record card and sees the brother is baptized, then he knows that individual has declared himself as wanting to do God’s will. A circuit servant would be very negligent if he passed a Publisher’s Record card by when a dedicated publisher was only preaching the good news, say, two hours a month. If he loves his brother he is going to help his brother to gain everlasting life, as life is what each one wants! Can a circuit servant help this one? Paul would do so, as he did with Timothy. If Paul saw such a condition, can you hear him saying to the brother: “Let us by love grow up,” and, “Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses”? (1 Tim. 6: 12) Paul said there is one way of getting “a firm hold on the everlasting life” and that is by offering a “fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.” Are you doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are not making “the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses,” will you let the circuit servant or district servant, or some other mature publisher in your congregation help you? To get a firm hold on life, say Yes. These shepherds, appointed by Jehovah God through his organization, want to help you—every one in God’s flock—and they are going to try to give you personal assistance. Will you accept that assistance? Paul gave Timothy fine spiritual counsel. Circuit servants and district servants are willing to give you personal assistance, help you with your field service schedule and show you how to use what you know of God’s Word. Circuit and district servants and congregation servants believe you when you say, “I have dedicated my life to do the will of Jehovah God.” A mature, strong brother has the responsibility of helping each and every one of his weak brothers and sisters to “fight the fine fight of the faith” and “get a firm hold on the everlasting life.” This means time praising Jehovah by being able to give sermons, follow up the interest, start and conduct Bible studies, and to help new ones associate with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An Analysis of Our Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the preaching work is going ahead each year, some definite weaknesses have been noted in various features of our ministry. This is the main one: TIME. While the number of publishers who have been doing the preaching work is growing, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the amount of individual service time is on the decline. For</span><span class="font0"> example, in 1959 congregation publishers averaged 10.4 hours per month; in 1960 it went down to 9.9 and in 1961 it dropped farther down, to 9.6. During this period regular and special pioneers also showed a decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Time affects back-calls. In 1959 publishers averaged 3.7 back-calls per month; in 1960 the average was down to 3.4 and for 1961 it was down to only 3.2. Bible studies are affected too and dropped from an average of 192,765 per month in 1959 for publishers and all pioneers down to 185,785 in 1961. The average has fallen for congregation publishers from .7 to .6; for regular pioneers, from 5.4 down to 4.6; for special pioneers, from 8.9 down to 7.9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These figures pointedly tell us that there has been a downward trend on the part of the individual publishers and all pioneers, on the average, in preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. This should not be. Living in the time of the end as we are, with Armageddon facing this generation with certainty, the ministry on the part of all persons should be on the increase, not on the decrease. Why? Not to build up a record of figures but, rather, because lives are at stake—the lives of all whom Jehovah has called from the darkness of this world to his marvelous light to preach the good news of the Kingdom, and also the lives of the ones who are to have opportunity to hear. (1 Pet. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font0"> 9) Jesus emphasized the importance of sharing in the ministry when he stated: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father.” (Matt. 7:21) The apostle Paul very pointedly tells us the necessity of performing the ministry, saying that, while it is with the heart one believes, it is with the mouth confession is made to salvation. (Rom. 10:8-10) These scriptures emphasize that our salvation will come not only from knowing the truth but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">also from having a part in the joyful work of the ministry.</span><span class="font0"> All publishers and pioneers should feel as Paul did, who said at 1 Corinthians 9: 16: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news'” Yes, these scriptures make it plain that if we are to please Jehovah and abound in his favor, we must not only have a knowledge of his purposes but we must have a reasonable share in doing the work he has asked his people to do before Armageddon strikes. Appreciating the import and direction of these scriptures, the Society has given much thought and consideration to the matter of what can be done to aid individual publishers in each congregation to have a greater share in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before making pertinent suggestions, the Society wishes all to understand clearly that what is herein discussed is not to build up fine-appearing records or charts. Come Armageddon, charts and records will be of no value. Being alive is what will count. Why, then, are records, figures and quotas used now and referred to? Only to help us individually see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">just what we are doing</span><span class="font0"> and to aid us to see weaknesses in our ministry that need attention. It takes work to get things done. Work takes time! The preaching work we do is accurately reflected in our reports. Records tell us what is being done in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, which will result in salvation for Jehovah’s people and those who listen to us. (1 Tim. 4: 16) Only with this in mind are records useful at this time. They help us to see what is necessary in connection with our ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the president’s meetings with circuit and district servants various records were used to enable all to see clearly just what is being done in the ministry. Not only was counsel given with regard to circuit and district servants’ taking a zealous lead in the field ministry, which they are doing, but also ways were pointed out whereby they could directly aid more individual publishers in each congregation to have a greater share in the ministry. How is this to be done? By giving more personal attention to individual publishers, pioneers and servants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">through an extension of the training program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">For the last three years the trend has been toward fewer hours spent in the field by the individual publishers, regular and special pioneers. Here is what circuit and district servants can do to aid publishers to increase their share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Society has suggested the reasonable goal of at least ten hours each month in field ministry for publishers. It is appreciated and is commendable that many mature publishers are reporting much more time than ten hours each month. Such have come to know the great joy of the ministry and will continue to have the fullest possible share that they can arrange for. To help the many publishers who are averaging less than ten hours a month, the circuit servant, as he checks Publisher’s Record cards on Tuesday of each visit to your congregation, will make a notation of at least one or more of these publishers. Sometime during the week—after a meeting, when visiting at their homes, having a meal with them, working with them in the field, or at any opportune time—he will personally speak with each publisher in a kind and constructive way and help him with a practical, workable schedule so as to devote ten hours each month to field service. The circuit servant will not arbitrarily make a schedule for the publishers to keep, but will discuss the matter with them and show each publisher how it would be possible for him to increase his part in God’s work in accord with the publisher’s circumstances. For example, say the publisher now spends two hours a month in the ministry. He has little joy from his ministry, because he is spending very little time at it. Jesus said happiness comes from giving. The more one gives, the greater his happiness. (Acts 20: 35) How can the two-hour-a-month publisher be aided by the circuit servant to increase his joy by arranging to spend ten hours a month in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Circumstances of publishers vary, but, commendably, nearly all attend the congregation book studies. Circuit servants will encourage publishers to share in prestudy field service for one-half hour or more. With the publisher attending the congregation book study, it means only starting a little earlier from home for the study. If convenient, the publisher can attend the meeting for field service at the study location. If not convenient, he can work territory from his home en route to the study location, doing house-to-house work with magazines or campaign literature, making back-calls, or doing street work. By spending at least one-half hour in prestudy service each week, this adds up to at least two hours each month. This plus the two hours the publisher has been spending in the field service brings his activity to four hours. In a few weeks of regular witnessing he may find an interested person and get a Bible study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now by starting and conducting a Bible study near home some other evening, or in the morning or afternoon, four times each month, the publisher will have another four hours in field service, which now brings the total to eight hours. (Circuit servants will be happy to start studies for publishers, as discussed later in this report.) This leaves only two hours more to be arranged for in a whole month’s time to make it ten hours! Depending on the circumstances and available time of the publisher, his obligations, whether the rest of the family is in the truth, and so forth, these remaining two hours can be planned for on a weekday, a Saturday or Sunday. By going out one morning or afternoon during the week or on a Saturday or a Sunday the publisher will be able to get in two more hours’ time. This will bring the publisher’s total to ten hours per month, which is a reasonable amount of service, considering his circumstances. He would be able to report one home Bible study and four back-calls because he is making weekly visits. There are many other ways for one to work out a ten-hour schedule for one’s quota in hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Circuit servants will carry a little reference book and make a note of the publisher’s name and the suggestions made. On his next visit to the congregation the circuit servant will check his notebook and then pay particular attention to the ministry of this individual publisher he personally talked to and helped in the field on his previous visit, to see how he got along and the progress he made. He will commend all those whom he helped and who made progress and he will make additional suggestions if any are needed. It is the publisher’s life the circuit servant is interested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On each visit to a congregation the circuit servant will select five publishers to talk to and personally aid and show them how they can increase their share in the ministry. It may be in his hours or maybe helping a good-hours publisher in his back-call or Bible study work in which he is weak. Circuit servants who are married will select five </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sisters for their wives to assist </span><span class="font0">personally the same way. This will mean personal assistance being given to ten individuals on each visit. What a loving arrangement on the part of these servants of God to aid many to increase their share in God’s work! The Society feels sure that all publishers who are approached by the circuit servant or his wife will appreciate this provision of personal assistance and will greatly benefit by it. Publishers need not wait for the circuit servant or his wife to approach them. Knowing of this provision for personal assistance, publishers may approach the circuit servant on his visit and ask for help. He will be glad to assist and talk over problems with as many publishers as he can while he is with the congregation. Time spent preaching the good news brings experiences, and these bring our joy. More time in the field means more peace and joy and getting “a tight grip on the word of life.” —Phil. 2: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to rendering this personal assistance to publishers, circuit servants will continue to aid the servants and study conductors to see the importance of their taking a zealous lead in the field, at least ten hours a month, for almost invariably the health and activity of the congregation can be measured by the activity of its servants and study conductors. It may be the circuit servant will select the name of a study conductor or a servant as one of the five publishers to whom he wants to give special assistance. He ■will also aid these brothers to see what they can do in encouraging and aiding publishers to share regularly in the ministry. There is no compulsion about this arrangement. It is ‘by love growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meetings for field service will continue to be arranged through service centers. During the circuit servant’s visit and at all other times they should start on time and be dismissed on schedule so all can go to the territory without waste of time. Midweek service should also be arranged for the convenience of the publishers in each congregation. All publishers who possibly can are encouraged to support the Sunday morning field service and spend at least two hours in the house-to-house work and then an hour or so in the back-call work or conducting a Bible study. Remember, get a good taste of field service each month. Try to be at least a ten-hour publisher. Have someone help you be one and have the joy Christ Jesus had when he preached. Time spent in the greatest work on earth is time enjoyed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Back-Call Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A feature of our ministry that needs much attention is the back-call work. Just as average hours per publisher have been dropping for the past three years, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">so have back-calls. The national </span><span class="font0">average now is 3.2 a month. That is less than an average of one back-call per publisher each week. To see clearly the need for making more back-calls, note what our 1961 service year averages show as set forth below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Month. Av. &nbsp;&nbsp;Month. Av. &nbsp;Month. Av.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cong. Pubs. Back-Calls Bible St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">240,328 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;780,334 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;145,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- 583,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">197,334 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1583^000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">240,328 ) 197,334 ( .8</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The above figures show that if Bible studies are conducted each week, as they should be, out of 780,334 back-calls reported, 583,000 back-calls are made conducting Bible studies. This leaves only 197,334 extra back-calls, which, divided by 240,328, gives us .8 as the number of back-calls made apart from the studies. Our monthly average of literature placed by congregation publishers for the 1961 service year is 106,947 books, 260,516 booklets, 2,875,562 magazines, 44,456 subscriptions—a total of 3,287,481 placements of some kind each month, and yet there were only 197,334 back-calls over and above ones made in connection with Bible studies. It is true that many magazine placements cannot be followed up, but it is apparent from these figures that there is a great need for many more back-calls to be made at homes where literature was left. The Society sees much to be done in the back-call work and suggests that each publisher try to make at least six back-calls each month. One weekly Bible study will mean four back-calls each month and sometimes five a month. So the quota of six would mean one or two back-calls each month in addition to conducting a weekly Bible study. What can circuit servants do to help publishers have a greater share in the back-call service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On going through the Publisher’s Record cards at the start of his visit, he will list in his notebook a publisher who does well placing literature and who is good in hours but who is not making back-calls. He will personally talk to that one and learn why no back-calls are being made or why there is no success if he is calling back and then render personal assistance to help him see how he can share more fully in this service. If his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">afternoon schedule</span><span class="font0"> is not full, he will invite this publisher to go with him in the back-call service. Calls will be made on placements of the publisher, and studies will be started wherever possible. The circuit servant will make a note of the discussion he had with this publisher and on his next visit, when talking the matter over again, he will be interested to observe what progress has been made. Here is another way the circuit servant can give personal assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here are some things for all of us to reflect on: Is a House-to-House Record being kept? Do service centers have a back-call night? Do study conductors and servants take the lead in this feature of the ministry? Is the third hour on Sunday being used for back-call activity? Does the training program assignment include back-call and Bible study work as well as sermon training? The circuit servant should check into these matters as he serves and he will do what he can to aid the congregation to increase this feature of their ministry, which is in need of much attention. Personal assistance for all making back-calls in a congregation may change matters considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As with our hours and back-calls, there has been a decline in Bible study activity. The Society has suggested the goal of one Bible study per publisher. Two hundred and forty-three congregations scattered throughout fortyeight states average one or more Bible studies per publisher. Of the 243 congregations, some are large, some small, and some medium-sized. With proper assistance undoubtedly many more congregations will soon be averaging one Bible study per publisher. Is there a need for many more to share in the Bible study service? Yes' At present only 41 percent of the publishers share in this most pleasant, joyful and rewarding feature of the ministry. Will you share in Bible study work in 1962?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the circuit servant visits the congregation, he will note in his book one or two individuals not reporting studies and will do all he can during the week to start and turn studies over to them. At the conclusion of the Tuesday evening service meeting, the circuit servant will encourage publishers to take advantage of all opportunities to start studies when literature is placed during the week and when they are making back-calls. Publishers will be invited to let him know of studies started during the week, and Sunday evening he will advise the congregation what was accomplished. The circuit servant has as his goal starting at least two Bible studies each week. Studies he starts will be turned over to publishers working with him or, if he is working alone when a study is started, he will make an arrangement for some local publisher to take it over. When he returns to the congregation on his next visit, he will want to visit the study he started, with the publisher who is now conducting it. He will have this recorded in his notebook too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All circuit servants are doing well in starting new studies each week. Many start two or more every week. The potential that exists with each circuit and district servant doing his part is really amazing. We have 257 circuit servants and 25 district servants, which is a total of 282. With each one starting two studies a week, there will be a total of 564 studies started weekly. Since most of the circuit and district servants are married, with their wives starting two studies also each week, there would be a total of over 1,000 new home Bible studies started each week or 4,000 a month. In twelve months the total of new studies started would be some 48,000! Publishers will want to take advantage of the opportunities to take over these studies that are started and turned over to them by the visiting servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bible studies should be conducted every week for persons of good will to learn quickly and benefit the most from the study. If, due to some circumstances, the study can be conducted only three times, or two times or even once a month, it can be reported as a study, but it is much better to make it a weekly study, fifty-two hours or more of study a year, which is what a Bible study should be, if at all possible. The circuit servant will check the Bible study file on each visit to see if studies are being conducted weekly. He will also check with the publishers who conduct studies irregularly and see what can be done to make each one a weekly study. He will also check with publishers who have conducted studies for the last four or five years with persons who do not attend meetings as yet and who do not share in the service. If the publisher conducting the study has properly invited the person to meetings and to share in service, with no response on the part of the student, possibly the circuit servant will suggest that the study be turned over to a publisher who has not conducted a study. Doing so will have three benefits: It will enable one who has never conducted a study to gain experience; it will provide the person of good will being studied with an opportunity to continue taking in knowledge; and it will free the publisher who has been conducting this study for several years without any fruitage to look for someone new who may have greater appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the personal attention a circuit servant will give the publishers, he will also check the servants and study conductors to see that they are sharing in the Bible study service and that they aid others. He will also check with the Bible study servant to learn what he personally is doing in aiding publishers to share in Bible study service. The Bible study servant’s assignment is not fulfilled by posting records. His main service is working with the brothers in the field, helping them to share in the back-call and Bible study service. He will also encourage publishers who have the ability to start studies with ease to train others who do not have Bible studies and turn studies over to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Constantly we place a great number of Bible-study aids in the field. Our responsibility toward the sheep is not fulfilled in placing literature. Rather, all publishers will want to help people who manifest good will by starting and conducting weekly Bible studies. A Bible study helps you too. It helps you ponder over the good things in God’s Word. Then something wonderful happens. “By doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” —1 Tim. 4: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Publisher Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From Bible studies come new publishers. As new ones learn the truth they should be directed to the organization. This means attending meetings and sharing in the service, both of which are a part of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Once starting new persons in the service, we must help them continue to be active month after month. This requires personal assistance. An arrangement making this possible should function in each congregation. Strong, mature publishers will aid and encourage less mature ones. The circuit servant will check on his visit to see that the local congregation is rendering assistance to ones who need assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On going through the Publisher’s Record cards, the circuit servant will note names of dedicated publishers who have become irregular. He will personally call on these publishers sometime during the week. Their lives are at stake. The circuit servant will lovingly encourage these publishers to share regularly in worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To enjoy the great ingathering work of today and see the sheeplike ones “come,” a congregation must not only start new ones in service but it must hold the publishers already started in the field work. For each publisher who starts and stops, two new publishers must be started before an increase is shown. One of the two new publishers covers the loss and the second new publisher shows an increase. Virtually every report on a congregation submitted by the circuit servant shows new publishers started between visits. However, our percentage of increase is not proportionate to the number being started, which makes clear the need for more assistance to be rendered to undedicated new publishers as well as to dedicated publishers who show signs of weakness. The circuit servant will have this in mind as he serves each congregation. He will need your help to follow through when he is gone. Let us help everyone to “get a firm hold on the everlasting life.”—1 Tim. 6: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine activity has increased nicely. During the 1960 service year, publishers averaged 11.7 magazines per month. In 1961 the average went up to 12 per publisher. Wonderful work is being done with the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Circuit servants will work with as many publishers as possible, morning and afternoon on Saturday, which is his magazine day during his visit. He will show publishers the ease and joy of placing magazines and how magazine routes can be started. He will aid publishers who are not meeting the quota of twelve to see how they can have a greater share in the magazine service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ministerial Weaknesses to Be Progressively Worked On</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While a number of things have been mentioned that the circuit servant will have in mind working on as he renders personal assistance to various individuals in serving the congregation, he will continue to ascertain the main weaknesses in the congregation’s ministry and help the congregation see how they can overcome the weaknesses. He will not try to correct everything on one visit any more than the school servant endeavors to correct all weaknesses noted in a talk that an inexperienced brother gives in the ministry school. The circuit servant will take the main weakness first. For example, if the main weakness is hours, he will give that his attention. The next time he serves, if the congregation is averaging ten hours or better, he will look at the back-call activity. If it is weak, he will give that attention. If the congregation is averaging six back-calls per publisher, then he will give the Bible study activity attention. To a great extent, the Society has found in analyzing all of its records, if field service hours are up, back-call activity is up, Bible study activity is up and magazine placements are up. So the big thing in correcting any weakness in the ministry starts with hours being spent in the field service. Time spent in Kingdom service gets the work done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the district servant works with circuit servants he and his wife will personally share in this extension of the training program too. With circuit and district servants doing their part as they serve congregations, looking well to the personal interests of individual publishers as well as the overall activity of the congregations and the leadership and direction being given by servants and study conductors, the good news of the Kingdom will be preached to a greater extent than in the past. Greater joy and happiness are sure to be experienced by all the sheep in the congregation of God who courageously move forward, strong of heart, having complete hope in Jehovah in harmony with the yeartext for 1962.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Arrangement for Pioneers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">In the January, 1962, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom. Ministry</span><span class="font0"> it was pointed out that the percentage of publishers in the United States who are in the pioneer service has dropped to 3.4. The percentage of regular pioneers has dropped to 2.4. The Society appreciates the wonderful work that pioneers are doing. It is clearly to be seen that a 100-hour-a-month pioneer is doing the work of ten congregation publishers who average approximately ten hours a month. A special pioneer does witnessing work equal to fifteen congregation publishers in the United States. So pioneers and special pioneers are doing a very important work, and it takes time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The joy these pioneers can get from doing this blessed work is ten or fifteen times as great as what the congregation publisher gets because more time is being spent in this grand service. They meet with more people, have more experiences and have happier relationships with others. It is a privilege extended to all dedicated persons, and everyone should give consideration to this privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some years ago the Society tied the pioneers in closer with the congregations by arranging for them to get their books, booklets and magazines through the congregations if they were working in a congregation’s territory. In this way the Society could discontinue accounts with individual pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Later on the Society found it advisable for the congregation service committee to approve all pioneer applications, and this has aided the Society greatly in getting better representatives on the pioneer list. While these arrangements have brought the pioneers closer to the congregation, yet it is not close enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Think of it this way: At the present time the pioneers do not have as close an oversight of their activity by the congregation overseer as do other publishers. Surely everyone in Jehovah’s organization wants to come directly under a responsible shepherd. If the pioneer is tied in more closely with the local congregation, then he will come under the supervision, help and direction of an overseer. The congregation servants are now being trained at the Kingdom Ministry School and they are able to give better supervision to pioneers and congregation publishers alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pioneers have reported directly to the Society, with only the Society knowing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font0"> they were doing, but it did not know how they were doing it. The Society feels it would be better for all pioneers, regular, vacation and special, to be a part of the congregation they work with and come under the guidance of the congregation servant. This will enable the local congregation servant to oversee all the work properly in his territory, that being done by the congregation publishers as well as by the pioneers. He ean give pioneers helpful counsel and spiritual assistance the same as he does the congregation publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pioneers Become Part of the Local Congregation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Starting with March 1, 1962. all pioneers working in congregation territory, whether regular, vacation or special, will turn their monthly report cards over to the local congregation servant. A Publisher’s Record card will be made out for each pioneer. The pioneer’s report will be posted each month on his Publisher’s Record card. When posted on the Publisher’s Record card, the congregation servant will initial the pioneer report card or the special pioneer report form under the Hours column. This will show the Society that the report has gone through the congregation servant’s hands and has been posted. Publisher’s Record cards of all pioneers will be kept in the back of the active congregation Publisher’s Record cards and will be filed alphabetically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the congregation servant has posted the pioneer report on the Publisher’s Record card he will immediately mail the pioneer report card to the Society. Please do this not later than the third of the month. If several pioneers are in a congregation, then all the cards can be put in a single envelope and sent to the Society, marked in the lower left-hand corner “Report Desk.” This will save postage. The Society plans to print and send a supply of envelopes to each congregation for use in sending pioneer reports to the Society. When additional envelopes are needed they can be ordered on the regular order blank. If only one pioneer is with a congregation the congregation servant can put a postage stamp on the report card and mail it immediately without putting it in an envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the Society to complete the field service report and publish it in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> each month it will be necessary to receive all reports early in the month. Therefore, pioneer reports for the regular, vacation and special pioneers should be mailed to the Society by the third of the month. If the congregation report is ready for mailing by that time, send it along. Otherwise, it may be mailed separately but no later than the 5th or 6th day of the month. It takes time to tabulate a monthly feport for 4,430 congregations and over 8,000 pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the future no more report cards will be sent directly to the regular and vacation pioneers. Those working in congregation territory will get their monthly report cards and other supplies from the congregation servant, usually through the literature room. (The special pioneers will get their report slips direct from the Society once a year as they have special forms, and these are limited in number and are generally assigned in isolated territory.) The congregation servant will always see to it that he has the necessary supplies for all vacation and regular pioneers in his territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Society will continue to keep a separate record of each individual regular, vacation and special pioneer and, therefore, we need all reports at the Society’s office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All pioneers will continue to be appointed by the Society and will receive their assignments through the Society as they have in the past, but they will now come more directly under an overseer’s supervision in congregation territory. Of course, pioneers working in isolated territory not assigned to congregations will get their assignment directly from the Society as heretofore. Pioneers and special pioneers working in isolated territory will receive their supplies direct too, and they will make their reports directly to the Society until such time as a congregation is formed in that isolated territory. Then they will come under the congregational arrangement if they remain in that assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Publisher’s Record Card File</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whenever a member of the congregation becomes a pioneer his Publisher’s Record card will be taken out of the publishers' file and under the “Remarks” will be written “Regular Pioneer” on the line for the month he starts this service. Then the card will be placed in the pioneer file of the Publisher’s Record cards. If one transfers from being a congregation publisher to being a vacation pioneer, the same thing would be done. The reverse is likewise true: When someone leaves the pioneer service, then the congregation servant will transfer the vacation, regular or special pioneer Publisher’s Record card into the regular publishers’ file and will make notation under the “Remarks” column on the month’s line of the change, that the individual is now a congregation publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The congregation servant is always notified by the Society when a new pioneer is enrolled in the congregation’s territory, and he is also notified when a pioneer is removed, so that he can make the necessary adjustments in his Publisher’s Record card file and keep his records straight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another advantage in having the pioneers under the jurisdiction of the congregation servant is that it will enable the congregation servant to see what each pioneer is doing in the territory assigned to the congregation of which he is overseer. From the pioneer reports he will be able to see the good things that the pioneer is doing in the ministry in the territory and he will be able to talk to the pioneer about taking parts on the service meeting program. The pioneer may be doing excellent work in some particular field of service, and if it is convenient to the pioneer, then the congregation servant may arrange for the pioneer to assist at times in the service centers and in taking new publishers into the field service. More cooperation can be worked out between the congregation publishers and the pioneers. From time to time special meetings on pioneer service are put on in the service meeting program and the congregation servant will then know which pioneers to use to handle certain parts of the program because of their ability in doing the work in the field. They can often be used in demonstrations and in taking parts in the service meeting program as the other congregation publishers are. Surely they will feel more a part of the congregation, and that is how it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the congregation servant sees that a pioneer is putting in a lot of time but is not accomplishing much, he will be able to give that pioneer counsel because he has his record in the files and will be checking it every month as he does the records of congregation publishers and he can give him the assistance needed. Maybe there is a good, regular congregation publisher that can help this pioneer with the sermons, with back-calls or with Bible studies or literature placements. When a person is spending one hundred hours in the field each month he wants to use that tinie wisely and efficiently. An overseer wants to help pioneers become mature the same as he wants to help the congregation publishers come on to maturity in the service. If it is found that a pioneer is placing a lot of literature, but is having difficulty starting studies, then perhaps a good congregation publisher can be of assistance to the pioneer. Maybe the pioneer is starting more studies than he can handle, and some of these studies can be turned over to congregation publishers. There are wonderful opportunities for the congregation publishers and the pioneers to work together in getting the territory served with the Kingdom message. Many mutual benefits will be forthcoming for pioneers and for congregation publishers under this arrangement of having pioneers tied in directly with the local congregation in whose territory they work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We pray that this arrangement will have Jehovah’s rich blessing. When the circuit servant visits a congregation he will be able to check the Publisher’s Record cards for the pioneers at the same time he goes through the congregation publishers’ cards. The circuit servant will continue to meet with the pioneers Tuesday afternoon and will render whatever personal assistance he can during his week’s visit. Good pioneers may be able to assist the circuit servant with his plans in aiding congregation publishers if that is desired and is convenient to the pioneer. We want to help people live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will be interested to know that the 1963 service year chart will also show some of the pioneers’ accomplishments in the congregation territory, which will be discussed by the congregation servant at the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To assist more persons to see the privilege of pioneer service and to make arrangements for entering that service, the circuit assemblies, beginning in February, will have something to say about pioneer work. The district and circuit servants will have a meeting on Saturday afternoon with congregation publishers interested in pioneer service. Pioneers may also attend if they think it will be profitable. This meeting is to give congregation publishers the opportunity of asking questions and having them answered as they pertain to the pioneer service. Schedules might be suggested as to how one can arrange his affairs to get into the pioneer service. It may be that your problem will be answered if you are thinking about the pioneer work. The more time that one can give to preaching the good news of God’s kingdom, the more joy one is going to have in the service and the greater blessing he will be to others. Publishers should always feel free to go to a congregation servant or a circuit servant to ask about the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each congregation will do well to work toward the goal of having at least 5 percent of the publishers in their congregation in the pioneer service. This would be a grand thing for the witness work in your territory. Look at it this way: If a congregation</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">On April 8 the special public talk “Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?” will be given in all congregations. Make arrangements now. Order handbills. A copy of the talk will be sent later for the speaker. ♦ Memorial this year will be on April 17, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Printed Memorial invitations may be ordered from the Society, using the regular handbill order form. The price is 25c per 1,000; 15c for 500; 10c for 250. Please submit your order for these invitations at the same time as the order for the special public talk handbills, but on separate order forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ The April 15 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> will be a special issue featuring the public talk “Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?” The April 22 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font0">will highlight the theme “Early Christianity and Modern-Day Religion.” Let us give these two special issues as wide a distribution as possible. Congregation publishers, plan to place at least 30 magazines during April; pioneers, 120; special pioneers, 180. Congregations should ascertain their needs and order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ Our 20-percent goal for April is 298,417 publishers. Now is the time to start working toward it by laying the had one hundred cards in its file, publisher and pioneer cards, and 5 percent of the publishers were in the pioneer work, that would mean there would be ninety-five congregation publishers averaging approximately ten hours a month, or they would spend 950 hours witnessing in that territory. If 5 percent of the one hundred were pioneers, that would mean that five pioneers averaging one hundred hours in the field service would be preaching to the extent of five hundred hours each month in that same territory. More people of good will would be found, a greater sound of “COME” would be heard in your territory. Really, what it means is that if we had 5 percent of all the publishers in the congregation in the pioneer service we would be giving a 50-percent-greater witness to the Kingdom in the territory of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All publishers should think seriously about this matter. Our work is to preach the good news. It is our responsibility, be we congregation publishers or pioneers, to see that this good news of the Kingdom is preached in all the world for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the end is going to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vacation Pioneering</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Maybe you cannot be a regular pioneer all year long, but perhaps during one or two months of the year you can be a vacation pioneer. Congregation servants will continue to encourage the publishers to enter the vacation pioneer work. In addition to the vacation season for individuals and families many publishers now do vacation pioneer work during their slow season of secular work. Housewives are able to do it at various times of the year. Individuals not in the best of health sometimes can put in one or two months of pioneer service during a year’s time. Publishers of school age can spend their summers vacation pioneering, and often during holiday seasons they can do so. A number of congregation publishers arrange to vacation pioneer during the time that the circuit servant visits the congregation. Vacation pioneering has been a stepping-stone for many into the pioneer work. They taste the joy of this full-time pioneer service, and this foundation with those with whom we are studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ At the time this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font0">is going to press the Brooklyn factory has completed and shipped 1,452,500 copies of the new Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ It has become advisable to request that none of the Society’s publications be mailed to anyone in Romania by individual publishers. Questions about helping interested persons in Romania should be referred to the Office of the President. If anyone is traveling to Romania or any of the eastern European countries, it would be appreciated if he would contact the Society at least two months before his departure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ Some brothers have reported receiving replies from the Spanish Embassy in Washington that, contained tracts or booklets published by the Roman Catholic Church. If you received Catholic literature in reply to your letter to the Spanish Embassy, please send </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the envelope and all contents</span><span class="font0"> to the Office of the President, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, N.Y., as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">♦ New publications available:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">—Ewe, Efik has resulted in hundreds of persons becoming regular pioneers. Sometimes by vacation pioneering for a month or two it means that the individual places so much additional literature and gets so many studies started that it keeps him going as an exceptionally good congregation publisher for the rest of the year. It aids one toward maturity. It will help you get that firm hold on everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Use the Remaining Time Wisely</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of us know that this generation is going to come to its end soon. Time is running out. The old world is fast asleep and does not want to be made aware of the nearness of this world’s end. How vital it is that we act differently! Surely it is the course of wisdom to press on displaying our love and appreciation to Jehovah God by having the fullest possible share in doing the good work of preaching the good news now as Jehovah’s dedicated people. We want to do Jehovah’s work properly during these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We of all people love life and we can ‘get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which we are called’ by being good congregation publishers or good pioneers. The pioneer, to be sure, is going to have more joy because he is going to be able to spend more time in the preaching and teaching activity. However, whatever you are, be a good servant carrying on true worship of the Sovereign Ruler. Let the circuit and district servants help you. Let any overseer or mature publisher in your congregation help you on to maturity. Maturity is truly necessary in gaining everlasting life. Let every one of us heed the words of Paul: “I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus. Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God Will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” —Phil. 3: 14-16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I Have My Own Church Literature”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Recently many brothers, upon offering the subscription, have been confronted with the objection, “I have my own church literature.” Perhaps you have met this objection and have wondered how you could most effectively reply. Whatever your response, be positive, recognizing the superior value of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Some brothers overcome this objection by tactfully stating: “As a reader of such literature you are apparently interested in finding the Bible’s answer to today’s troubled situation. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> points out the answer, consistently drawing attention to God’s kingdom as the real hope, just as Jesus did, and it shows you where in the Bible you can find proof to establish your faith in this kingdom. Please note what is stated here. . . .” (Show point in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> where Kingdom hope is established.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Others say, “It is good to hear</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a grand time we had distributing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> during December I Brothers, you will be interested to know that the demand for Bibles was so great that the Society had to have extra shifts working in the factory constantly to meet the demand. Even so, by the end of December most congregations in the United States had cleared their shelves. With all working together, there were 317,530 books placed during the month, nearly all of which were Bibles. That is the highest number of books that have been placed in any one month in over nine years. Well done I Now, let us follow up on these placements and start Bible studies wherever possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> And what about our 10-percent increase? Well, we did not quite reach it; we needed another 1,809 publishers to reach that goal. But we did have a 9.3-percent increase, which means that 271,740 did report. That is 19,(543 more publishers than we had last December, and that is wonderful! It is evident that of your interest in religious matters. Jesus said people would be happy if they were conscious of their spiritual need. (Matt. 5:3) Have you noted, though, that most church journals deal mainly with the functions of the religious organization rather than actually discussing the Bible? [Allow for comment.] </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is completely different in this respect, for it is a Biblestudy magazine. It is read by people of all religions. You will find much happiness in reading it, for it will do much to fill your spiritual need. Note how it gives the Bible answer to problems of today. . . .” (Have definite point to show householder.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If a discussion opens up, then you may put to good use the fine information in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines </span><span class="font11">(Subject .35, themes O'and D).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Discuss with others the ways they overcome the objection. Think about what you will say ahead of time. Then reflect confidence that you are presenting the finest Bible journal on the earth today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah r’c’ily blpssod the efforts made to aid new ones to start in service, which is a vital part of our ministry. And during the months to come we want to continue to accept our responsibility before Him by personally aiding these new ones to be regular and to press on to maturity. What a privilege is ours to share in this service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Incrsasing Time far God’s Work </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">is equivalent to the work of 15,015 publishers averaging ten hours a month for the whole year. When we see what a big difference it can make, it makes us think about it seriously, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Now how about each one of us personally? Are we satisfied with our service? Can we spend more time in God’s work? If we can, we should. If each of us who are now averaging less than ten hours would increase his service to ten hours each month, not only would our congregation average increase, but the whole country would have a tremendous increase in the works of God. When we think about it, it becomes apparent that ten hours each month, which is only two and a half hours</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">a week or about twenty minutes a day, is a very reasonable goal.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> How can our hours in service be increased? By making and holding to a schedule. Just as we must learn to budget our money in order to meet our obligations, so we must budget our time and see that we do not spend on other tilings what we ought to give to God. So, whether we are regular, vacation or special pioneers, or congregation publishers, we need, to make a schedule and then follow it. Let all of us who are congregation publishers make a schedule that will enable us to spend ten hours each month in God’s work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study for Sunday, February 18, we will be discussing our field ministry. Throughout the study the congregation service chart will be displayed and the conductor will be encouraging us to comment on our local activity as questions deal with the various features of the ministry. It will be a very interesting and helpful study, so let us all put forth a special effort to be there and to help others to be present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> We all know there is much work yet to be done, and it is going to take time to do it. Yet the time remaining to do the preaching work grows shorter every day. So now is the time for all of us to arrange our affairs to have the greatest possible share in doing the works of God.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Keep Awake to Christian Responsibility</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our record us a New World so ciety shows that we have been awake to our responsibility as Christians. Rut it is not enough to have done so in the past; both as an organization and as individuals we must continue to do so in the days to come. There is much preaching work to be done, and the urgency of the situation impels us to share zealously.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During May it will be our privilege to do this by offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book from house to house. What grand results we have had with it in the past! Already some seven million copies have been printed in thirty-one languages, and this month will give many more persons the opportunity to obtain and benefit from it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our sermon, “God’s Purpose for Man,” is one that most of us have enjoyed using in the past, but we all need to review it; so be sure to do that, to assure effective presen-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">tations right from the start. In addition, there is a. shortened form of the sermon outlined under “Presenting the Good Newts.” New publishers and young ones will appreciate having it to use, and others will find that it enables them to give a witness even when householders are busy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Of course, giving a sermon and placing literature are not enough; it is our responsibility to continue to ‘feed the sheep.’ That requires much personal attention and many return calls. Our quota of six back-calls per publisher should stimulate us all to give more attention to this activity. There are plenty of persons on whom to call: those who subscribed during the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign, others who promised to do so, and muny who obtained the special magazines. We want to give continued help to all who will accept it, having in mind starting regular home Bible studies. Nor should we forget those who started in the service with us during April. They, too, need continued help, in personal study, in meeting attendance and in the service, to be regular and fruitful ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> No doubt, many new publishers</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As pointed out in the February </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom- Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> our magazine activity increased nicely during the 1961 service year, and the nation as a whole averaged 12 magazines per publisher, the suggested quota. A wonderful work is being done with the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> However, in checking into the figures on magazine activity for the first six months of the 1962 service year (September through February) we note a drop in magazine averages for publishers, pioneers and special pioneers. During this period publishers in the United States averaged 11.4 magazines, a drop of .6 from the last year’s average. Pioneers dropped from 103 to 99, and special pioneers from 147.3 to 141.8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The chart to the right provides us with an analysis of the magazine activity for all congregations in the United States.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> How is your congregation doing? Is it among the 1,016 congregations that commendably averaged from 14 to 40 magazines per publisher each month? Or is it among the 807 congregations that are above the quota, averaging from 12 to 13.9? Is it among the 1,083 congregations just short of the quota, averaging between 10 and 11.9 magazines each will want to join with the rest of us on May 30, Decoration Day, when all congregations will have a special magazine day. Arrangements will be made to offer comfort, both to those who visit the cemeteries and in work from house to house. Appropriate for the occasion will be the June 1 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article “Will the Dead Live Again?”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">month? Or is it among the 1,427 congregations averaging between 2 and 9.9 magazines each month and that undoubtedly will be working for increased magazine placements in the months ahead? And how does your personal activity compare with that</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Keeping Awake to Christian Responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font9">Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Keeping Awake to Christian Responsibility.’’ (See “Watchtower,” February 1, 1961, pp. 82-89, and May 1, 1962, p. 286.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Question-and-answer discussion of main article, “Keep Awake to Christian Responsibility.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">22 min: “God’s Purpose for Man” Sermon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Encouragement by chairman for all to share fully in onemonth “Paradise” book offer. Briefly develop sermon for the congregation, discussing the introduction, body and conclusion as set forth below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme; God’s Purpose for Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A suggested introduction: “Good morning. I am one of a group of Christian workers calling briefly to help thinking people understand God’s purpose for man. Many wonder in this day and age just what God’s purpose is for man, or whether he even cares about what is happening here. We usually have a purpose in mind when doing things, do we not? [Let them reply.] Likewise, it is reasonable to expect that God has a purpose for man, and he does. To know what his purpose is helps us to appreciate why we are here and what there is to live for in the future. God’s original purpose for mankind is clearly expressed here at Genesis 1:28.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Gen. 1:28—Made earth paradise to be filled with perfect humans. (Page 25, par. 26, of “Paradise” book gives talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. After reading Genesis 1:28, take “Paradise” book out, turn to pages 20, 21 saying, “Here is an illustration of what that paradise was like,” and place the book in the householder’s hands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Briefly comment on illustration, then say, “As we know from reading Genesis, chapter three, that paradise was lost as a result of disobedience on the part of Adam and Eve. Did it mean God’s purpose for a paradise failed? Do you think it will ever be restored?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Isa. 55:11—Positive assurance that God’s purpose will come to pass. (Page 25, par. 27, for talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. Rs. 37:10, 11—Earth will be filled with peaceful, perfect humans. (Page 222, pars. 11-13, for talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">6. After reading and briefly commenting on Psalm 37, ask householder to turn to page 241. Comment on illustration and pose question, How will this paradise be restored? Answer: The kingdom we pray for as Jesus taught us at Matthew 6:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Conclusion: “Now is the time to learn more about God’s kingdom and his purpose for man. This publication has helped me and thousands of other people to understand from the Bible what one must do to live in this regained paradise. You may have the copy that is in your hand for the small contribution of 75 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Call on publisher prepared in advance to give sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Publishers relate experiences and results enjoyed using this presentation in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Another publisher prepared in advance gives sermon, but waits until end of sermon to present book, at which time pages 20, 21 are shown, with brief comment, and then page 241.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Encourage all to try both ways and use presentation that works best for them. Keep in mind starting of studies when opportunity affords at time of placing book. Make definite arrangements for return call so that studies can be continued or started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. Cover “What Happened Here in March?” and consider local report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">10 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk and demonstration on “Is Religion a ‘Personal Thing’?” (See “Watchtower,” April 1, 1962, p. 197.) Discuss its meaning to Jehovah’s witnesses and demonstrate how to handle objections in the field ministry. 30 min: Demonstration of “Various Ways to Start Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman shows importance of following up all “Paradise” book placements (1) by starting studies on initial call, or (2) by using book and demonstrating its use, so starting study on return call, or (3) by using back-call sermon. Each way to be demonstrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) On initial call, publisher concludes sermon with Psalm 37:10, 11, places book and says to householder: “Let me demonstrate to you how the book may be used to gain further information on God’s purpose for man. The questions at the bottom of each page can help you pick out the main points in each paragraph and can be used to discuss the book with others. On page 9, paragraph 1, [turn to page 9] the question is asked, What is a paradise?’ May I have your thought?” Chairman breaks in and remarks: “After several paragraphs are discussed arrangements are made to return next week to continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Chairman: Sometimes on a back-call a study can be started without giving a back-call sermon. Publisher demonstrates: After introducing himself, he says: “Last week I left the ‘Paradise’ book with you and we discussed Psalm 37:10, 11. It shows there will be an end to wickedness and that meek persons will inherit the earth. May I step in for just a few moments and show you how the book can be used to learn the Bible’s teaching on paradise and its restoration? If you’ll bring your copy I’ll show you how it makes clear the Bible teaching on paradise.” Then (as in above demonstration) publisher proceeds to demonstrate use of book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Chairman discusses with audience suggested back-call sermon. Introduction might be: “Since you demonstrated sincere interest in what the Bible has to say concerning God’s purpose for man, I made a special effort to come back to share with you more information on the subject. The Bible tells of many things that honest-hearted people will enjoy in the restored paradise when God’s purpose for man is realized. As you will recall we referred to Psalm 37:10, 11 last week [open book to page 222, par. 11; show householder] where it shows that God will destroy the wicked, and the meek ones will inherit the earth . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Chairman: Sermon may be enlarged to include additional scriptures if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Sermon demonstrated by competent publisher thoroughly prepared in advance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Supplies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> So that all of you will be acquainted with the Society’s arrangement for sending regular, vacation and special pioneer supplies, we are providing the following information :</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Regular Pioneers:</span><span class="font10"> When one is appointed to serve as a regular pioneer, the appointment letter and supplies are sent to the congregation servant. He will give to the pioneer the appointment letter, the assignment card and a weekly record sheet. Sufficient pink report cards (one for each remaining month of the service year) will be enclosed. The congregation servant will keep the cards, giving one to the pioneer at the end of each month to fill out and return to him, in harmony with instructions in the February, 1962, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font10"> The congregation servant will order a year’s supply (twelve cards) of pink report cards for each regular pioneer in the congregation for use the next service year when a notice appears in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> inviting him to do so. Should a pioneer change his assignment during the service year, he should obtain the report cards needed for the remaining months of that year and take them with him to his new assignment along with his Publisher’s Record card.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Vacation Pioneers:</span><span class="font10"> The congregation servant will receive sufficient cards to cover the entire period of each vacation pioneer’s appointment. When an extension of a vacation pioneer appointment is requested by the pioneer and approved, the congregation servant will receive additional cards. Thus these cards will</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Have you selected an unassigned territory and made application for it? Congregations are requested to do so by May 15. Pioneers, too, who can travel at least a hundred miles and then remain in unassigned territory a month or more are requested to write the Society immediately. Likewise, we want to remind families that would like to work unassigned territory or with a small congregation needing assistance to inform the Society as soon as possible, as outlined in the April </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All baptized publishers who have reported regularly for the past six months and who can arrange to do so are invited to vacation pioneer this summer. Obtain your application blank right away and turn it over to the congregation servant after you have filled it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">COFFER: June: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font9"> July-September: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified.”</span><span class="font9"> For unassigned territory the offer will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and one bound book, for $1.50. </span><span class="font10">never have to be ordered by the congregation servant. Vacation pioneers will keep a record of their field service on the regular Publisher’s Weekly Field Service Report slips and use them to fill out and thereafter return to the congregation servant the yellow report card he provides at the end of each month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Special Pioneers:</span><span class="font10"> The Society will continue to send supplies direct to special pioneers. Special pioneers have been advised by the Society that they may turn their report form over to the congregation servant for forwarding to the office, or the special pioneer can submit his report direct to the Society’s office. If the special pioneer sends his report direct to the office, he will turn in a Publisher’s Weekly Field Service Report slip with the totals shown for the month so the congregation servant can take this slip and post the Publisher’s Record card made out for the special pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Note:</span><span class="font10"> Congregation servants will please give pink report cards only to regular pioneers, yellow report cards to vacation pioneers, and use white report cards for the congregation report. If for some reason cards are lacking, he is to supply complete information that the card asks for on a white slip of paper and send it to the Society’s office in a Report Desk envelope. Two of these envelopes were sent with April statements. Additional envelopes may be ordered as needed, using the regular literature order blank. Special pioneers reporting to the Society should also use the Report Desk envelope.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">It has become advisable to request that none of the Society’s publications be mailed to anyone in Hungary by individual publishers. Questions about helping interested persons in Hungary should be referred to the Office of the President. If anyone is traveling to Hungary or any of the Eastern European countries, it would be appreciated if he would contact the Society at least two months before his departure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Many of Jehovah’s witnesses have inquired about making gifts to the Society and about writing wills so that their wishes will be carried out after death. An informative memorandum covering these matters is available to anyone who desires a copy. Write to the Society’s Legal Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> AU of us should be planning to attend one of the district assemblies scheduled for July and August. Assembling together is upbuilding and it brings joy to Christian hearts to be dwelling in a New World atmosphere, even for a few days, while congregating to take in the timely spiritual food that Jehovah has for his people. It is a good thing, too, to encourage and arrange for goodwill persons associated with our congregations to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Along with this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> you will be receiving Room Request forms. The instructions are to be carefully considered in a service meeting six to eight weeks prior to the assembly. Do not send these to the Society, but mail them to the convention headquarters address for the city where you will attend, doing so not earlier than six weeks prior to the assembly dates. Addresses are listed on the back of the lower part of the Room Request form. Volunteer Service forms are being sent to all congregations, and all desiring to serve their brothers at the assembly will want to fill out the form completely and return it to the congregation servant, who will sign it and mail it to the convention city where you will be attending. A great deal of work is required for successfully operating a convention. It is a joyful privilege to render faithful service on behalf of our brothers, and many hands lighten the task.</span></p></li>

In order to help many more share in this activity, a simplified sermon has been found advantageous. New publishers and young ministers, not having progressed to the point of giving three-to eight-minute sermons, will, nevertheless, want to share in offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book.

<p><span class="font9">Even a quick glance at our report tells us we certainly were aglow with the spirit. 9,118 more publishers than in February! And, average hours, back-calls and magazines all went up. For the first time since October our hours have been over ten per publisher. Well done, Kingdom publishers! All pioneers too are to be commended for increasing their hours, back-calls and magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We obtained 126,544 new subscriptions, to compare with 110,368 in February. And Bible studies continued shooting upward. In fact, they rose from last month’s 204,620 way up to 214,428, which makes a new peak, surpassing by far the 207,138 of October, 1959. With so many Bible studies being conducted and all of us aglow with the spirit, anxiously we will await the April report and all congregations being able to say “We Made It” for the 20-percent increase. </span><span class="font10">comment on illustration.) “I know you will want to read this Biblestudy aid which will help you understand more about God’s purpose for mankind.

Honest-hearted persons pray for the restoration of paradise conditions on earth when they say the Lord’s Prayer.” (Refer to what Matthew 6:9, 10 says as you open </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book to page 241.) “Wouldn’t it be a blessing to live on earth with conditions such as illustrated in this picture?

<p><span class="font10">I offer to accept something in trade? Remember, it takes only three magazines per week to reach the quota of 12 a month. If you have difficulty in reaching this goal, talk the problem over with your study conductor, the magazine-territory servant, your congregation servant or the circuit servant. They sincerely want to help you to be successful in this fascinating feature of the ministry. Where possible, they will be glad to arrange for you to work with a publisher who has good magazine placements so you can improve your effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> It is good for all of us to have a proper perspective of the magazine work. It is not merely to cover territory or prepare the territory for the regular offer. Many now in the New World society received their first taste of the truth from one of the magazines. This is an excellent and important means of spreading the good news. May we individually share in it to the full, obtaining and wearing an attractive lapel card prepared to fit the holder that you have been using at conventions for the past several years. Congregation servants should order the cards and celluloid holders as needed for their congregations. The cards cost 1c each and the celluloid holders 5c each. Spanish cards may be ordered at 1c each. No bumper signs are being provided this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Be courageous and positive in your plans to attend the convention. Show love in whatever manner you can by assisting others to attend the Courageous Ministers Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1962.</span></p>

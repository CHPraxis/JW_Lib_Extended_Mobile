<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER, 1960 “Seek peace and pursue it. For Jehovah’s eyes are upon the righteous.”—1 Pet. 3:11,12. VOL. Ill NO. 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EXERCISE PRACTICAL WISDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> This world is doomed. “Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” Blessed are those who exercise practical wisdom by suing for peace with God and his King, thereby making friends with the only Ones who can usher us into “everlasting dwelling-places.” How can we best urge others to exercise practical wisdom in a doomed world?—Jas. 4: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Start Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Conducting Bible studies is the most effective way to aid others to take the wise course Jesus recommended. To start studies, keep a record of placements. Call back on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font7"> person who shows interest. Think of the potential for studies: The great number of October 8 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and October 15 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">placements 1 These magazines have undoubtedly stirred up the interest of many persons. Do not forget them. Call back. Give the current sermon, make the current offer and try to start a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Be Bible-study conscious. Start a study on the initial call or when making the back-call. The two books in this month’s offer, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,</span><span class="font7"> are easy to place and easy to use in starting studies. One pioneer, during June, placed 106 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> books. “I might add,” she comments, “it has not been just placing books either, because in four days of nothing but back-calls, thirteen new Bible studies have been started and are continuing.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Many publishers are having excellent success with the simplified back-call sermon in conjunction with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News&quot;</span><span class="font7"> booklet. A brother in Florida writes: “Since receiving this sermon I have started three new studies with good results, following through due to the simplicity of the outline and the interest it arouses. It is practical.” For starting a study use whatever publication brings results for you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Goal of Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> The Society has suggested certain Bible study goals : That special pioneers try to conduct ten Bible studies each month, regular pioneers seven, and congregation publishers at least one. This is a reasonable goal, one that is possible to reach if we are all alert to our opportunities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Those who are not yet conducting a study will want to put forth specific efforts to obtain one. Many young publishers who are attending school have put forth the effort and are conducting studies in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book, often with their schoolmates. What of the older publishers</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conduct Bible Studies Regularly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Starting a Bible study is one thing; conducting it regularly is another. As </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> has pointed out, studies should not be counted till two meetings are held after the initial one and preparations have been made to study regularly. The drop in number of Bible studies apparently resulted from this clarification as to counting studies. This spotlighted the fact that some publishers have been conducting studies only once or twice. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">--------</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR NOVEMBER</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark0"><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">two booklets, for $1.25.</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Exercising Practical Wisdom in a . Doomed World.—Luke 16 : 8, 9.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">problem, then, is this : Once we start a study, how can we keep it going?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The first few studies, yes, even the first half-dozen, are crucial. How important here is the need for tactfulness ! Some persons shy away from being committed to a regular study, so many successful publishers merely make arrangements for the next visit, using the word “discuswho are unable to go out to conduct studies? The congregation may have Bible studies that are well established, and the good-will person may be willing to go to the publisher’s home for the study. What about publishers unable to conduct studies during the evenings? They can arrange to conduct a study during the day or on Saturday or Sunday. Conduct a study whenever you can properly do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> Let every service center try to reach this goal: Each publisher’s having a Bible study. Study conductors, discuss the matter with publishers who do not have a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sion” rather than study. Be well prepared. As much as possible stick to the positive Kingdom truths. Be a real teacher. If you really teach the householder, he will feel that he has learned something that a mere private reading of the paragraphs could never give him. Help the householder become acquainted with the Bible; commend him for progress in looking up scriptures. At the close of the study, review what has been learned so important points stand out. Whet the householder’s appetite for material to be considered next time by apt comments and questions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Conduct a Bible study once each week if possible. If circumstances during a month are such that it can be held only once, but it is an established study, then it may be reported as a study for that month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Men are often neglected in studies. All they often need is an invitation and they will join the study. Studying with the entire family will aid in keeping the study regular. Have interesting and informative studies, and the householder and family will be anxious to continue | the discussion from week to week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theme: Exercising' Practical Wisdom in a Doomed World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Welcome, text, comments, and talk on “Exercising Practical Wisdom in a Doomed World.” (See “Watchtower,” November 15, 1959, pp. 684-698, and November 1, 1960, p. 663.) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font6">Question-and-answer discussion of article “Exercise Practical Wisdom.” In discussing pars. 2-4, arrange for a number of publishers who conduct Bible studies to relate how they started them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">22 min: </span><span class="font6">Use Sermon and Start Stud</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) To capture interest of householder we must be well prepared. Sermon “God’s Purpose for Man” effectively used in May and June will be our sermon for November and December. Want to review it and also ways to start studies. “From Paradise Dost to Paradise Regained,” “Let God Be True” or “This Good News of the Kingdom” may be used to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(7 min.) Review with audience points in May 1960 “Kingdom Ministry,” page 2, which gives details for following sermon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: God’s Purpose for Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God made earth paradise to be filled with perfect humans</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">—Gen. 1: 28 Positive assurance that God’s pur</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pose will come to pass —Isa. 55: 11 Earth will be filled with peaceful,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">perfect humans &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Ps. 37: 10, 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom we pray for will make</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">this possible —Matt. 6:9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Remind audience many studies can be started on initial placement. How? Watch brother give model sermon and, in conclusion, start study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(8 min.) Model sermon by qualified publisher. Offer accepted and study started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(3 min.) On return calls some brothers have found back-call sermon unnecessary to start a study. This simple but effective way has been very successfully used by many. Brother demonstrates, after introduction: “When I left the books ‘Let God Be True’ and ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained’ with you last week, I promised to return and show you how they may be used with your Bible to gain accurate knowledge of the restoration of paradise to this earth, in harmony with our prayer. If you would like to get your copy of ‘Let God Be True’ [or ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained’] I will show you the points in the book I have in mind.” Then go right into a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) In other cases brothers find it advantageous to give a back-call sermon, starting the study as we have been doing with “This Good News of the Kingdom.” The number of Bible studies has dropped off considerably during the last year. November and December campaign offers excellent opportunity for all to start studies. Be Bible-study conscious and utilize the suggestions to start and thereafter continue Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the article “Will We Make December’s Quota?” and the slogan on page 1, based on Rev. 22:2. Throughout the month, keep suggestions on regularity in service and aiding new ones before the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Discussion between two who conduct Bible studies of “Yearbook” experiences that show how to overcome difficulties and have the patience needed to establish and continue home Bible studies.—-Pp. 104, 148, 214, 221, 273.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">18 min: Report from Bible study servant, and consideration of the article “Conduct Bible Studies Regularly” with talk and audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">18 min: Review of “Paradise” back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(2 min.) Bible study servant approached by publisher who asks for help to make back-call on “Paradise” placement. Publisher has not used back-call sermon, would like to know how to use the Bible and “Paradise” book together. Servant suggests they go through it together, thereafter they will make actual call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(12 min.) After introduction and being invited in, look up Ps. 37: 10, 11 in Bibles again and read. Ask: Where did that say there will be no more wickedness? What, then, will be restored on earth? “Paradise” book, page 222, par. 11, discusses this scripture. Read it up to Ps. 37: 10, 11, and discuss. Even without wicked persons, could earth really be a paradise if poorly managed? What would result? Read par. 10 up to Isa. 9: 7. This is the Bible’s promise. Look up and read Isa. 9:7. It is just as quoted in paragraph. (You are establishing trust in the book's Scriptural foundation.) What conditions does this show will prevail? How will this mean the end of the bad ones just discussed? What government will do this? Point out that the questions on pars. 10 and 11 have been answered. (Shows value of questions, gradually working into use of them.) Could we enjoy this if we were sick? Would it be possible to do away with sickness? Read Matt. 4:23 and discuss how Jesus as King would logically use that power. Read par. 14 and then consider the question on it. The paragraph mentions living forever. This, too, is Bible’s promise. Read 1 Cor. 15:25, 26 in Bible. Before referring to par. 17, read the question on it, draw out the points on the paragraph, then point out how book explains it. (Value of right study procedure is thus demonstrated.) Read par. 17 in summary. Turn to picture on page 224, discuss the paradise hope. What would a paradise be like? See page 9, par. 1, consider the question, draw comments from householder, read paragraph, and the study is under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(2 min.) Servant and publisher discuss ease and value of sermon presented this way. Householder’s knowledge of and interest in paradise have been furthered. You have shown how the book will help him learn of it with his Bible. Being interested, householder is glad to continue discussion next week. Publisher sees how valuable the sermon is, didn’t realize it was so easy and effective to use, feels he can make call alone and start study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(2 min.) Chairman: Encourage all to use this suggestion. Study conductors will review it with their group Sunday morning and encourage them to use it after house-to-house work. Let all publishers make return visits and use it to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">9 min: Concluding comments, including slogan on page 4, based on Acts 20: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: New World News and Announcements, including “Traveling in Europe?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” pars. 94-100. Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Talk and demonstration of Presenting the Good News article on “Teach When Giving Your Sermon.” 15 min: Concluding comments. Arrange in advance to have a number of experiences related about conducting home Bible studies, showing the joys of the work and the results of preparation and patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">12 min: Talk and questions and answers on the Congregation Organization article “Improving Service 'Meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">18 min: “Teaching at the Congregation Book Study.” Two congregation book study conductors discuss together and illustrate pars. 1-3. Comment on suggestions given in pars. 4-6 and demonstrate them, conducting a model book study, but without reading paragraphs in summary. Then the two conductors discuss together how to apply the counsel in par. 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">15 min: Take the Initiative in Planning to Be a Pioneer. Talk, preferably by a pioneer. Emphasize that those who cannot find part-time jobs can often create their own. Discuss suggestions in November 8 issue of “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10 min: Concluding comments,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Congregations having a fifth service meeting in November should plan their own program, taking into consideration counsel given on the latest circuit servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Exercise Practical Wisdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font7">Make definite arrangements for giving assistance.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> Thursday, November 24, is worldly “Thanksgiving Day,” a fine opportunity for helping others take the course of practical wisdom.

<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>9</sup> Seize the opportunities before you during November. Start Bible studies.

The financial statement should be read and briefly explained the first of each month. Society letters should be read with feeling and proper oral emphasis so that the publishers are moved to respond or co-operate in the ways suggested.

<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Teaching at the Congregation Book Study</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The congregation book study is designed to aid those attending to get the sense of God’s Word. The study conductor, then, must be a teacher. He should be interested in the progress of all in the group and encourage all to participate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> To benefit to the full from the group study, each one should prepare in advance. It is vital that the conductor do so in order to guide the group to a clear understanding of the material studied. Some find that they can do their studying on the day of the meeting. But if you do not have enough time to do justice to it at that time, prepare your lesson a day or two before. The important thing is to have a regular time set aside for it and stick to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Always keep the main ideas in the lesson to the fore. The printed questions draw attention to these main thoughts. Other details in the lesson should be used to support the principal points, but they should not be given so much attention that they overshadow them. It will help to keep in focus the objective of the study if the theme stated in the chapter title and developed in the subheadings is repeatedly emphasized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Encourage all to use the Bible freely, both commenting on the application of texts quoted in the paragraphs and reading and applying those texts that are merely cited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> The conductor must be alert to determine whether those commenting understand or are merely repeating the words in the book. Even after a correct answer has been given, it is often necessary to stimulate discussion of the point by using additional questions in order to make sure that everyone really understands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> When questions are asked by those present, the conductor should help them to get the answer. This does not mean that he must always give the answer himself. By the use of leading questions and scriptures, he may guide them to the answer. Or he may ask someone else to comment on the point, thus giving others opportunity to use the things they have learned. Questions that are not on the lesson should usually be held until after the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> An effective teacher will aid those attending the study to gain, not only answers to Bible questions, but a heartfelt appreciation of Jehovah, his Word, his organization and the ministry entrusted to them. He considers both the mind and the heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach When Giving Your Sermon</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> There is more to effective presentation of the good news than’ merely reading and explaining scriptures in a sermon. A minister must teach as well as preach. The householder must think, his mind being kept active on the subject. Therefore you must take the initiative to make the conversation two-way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> You have doubtless found that interest is awakened by drawing the householder into the conversation during the introduction. Now as you proceed to discuss the scriptures in the sermon, you must not only keep interest alive but you must make the individual understand. Do this by getting him to converse with you throughout the sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> In the sermon on paradise, after reading Genesis 1: 28 from the Bible or from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book, page 25, you could say: “Do you think that God meant Adam and Eve to fill the earth with people living under the conditions of unrighteousness and suffering that exist today?” Or you could ask: “Was God here speaking to a sinful, imperfect couple?” Whatever he answers, you can then reason with him that the disobedient act of eating the forbidden fruit came later.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Will We Make December's Quota?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Will we reach our 10-percent quota of 255,895 publishers in December? The possibility is bright if we each do our part, and especially if we teach good-will persons the privilege it is to share the good things learned about the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> If study conductors will organize their groups so that all can receive assistance, if congregation servants go over the arrangements with each conductor and offer aid where needed, if assistant congregation servants supply information regarding those who need help, then we can expect December’s report to be most encouraging. However, above all, we must teach new ones to take up the vocation of the ministry, not as something we do just in December, but as life’s goal. This we can do if we follow a progressive program. ing Isaiah 55 :11, you might ask: “It is good to know that God has assured us he will restore right conditions, isn’t it? [Pause.] But how will he do it?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> After reading Psalm 37 :10, 11 you could remark: “When you think back over human history, it has never been this way, has it?” (Get his comment.) “That is why there have been so many wars. But do you think it would be so if really honest, peace-loving ones ruled the earth?” After he answers, you may lead to the next scripture by commenting (as in the book, page 222, paragraph 13) about men being at peace with God, explaining that such peaceful situation will be maintained by God’s power from heaven, as stated by Jesus at Matthew 6: 9, 10. Ask if he can visualize such a condition. A question asked after giving an illustration usually brings forth an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Plan beforehand just what questions you will ask and when you will ask them. They should always be such that the person’s mind will be held to the theme. They should promote a positive, friendly attitude, put the person at ease and make him feel free to express himself, to discuss the matter with you and to ask questions of you as a Bible teacher.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> First, build in good-will persons an appreciation for the truth and for Jehovah’s organization. After each study take time to acquaint them with the structural organization of the New World society, its meetings and purposes. Take them with you to congregation meetings. Second, invite them to go with you in the service—from house to house, on back-calls and home Bible studies. Aid them in the preparing of simple introductions and sermons. Practice the sermons with them. Always keep before them the idea of advancement. Third, help them to arrange a schedule. Show them how easy it is for them to engage in each feature of the ministry each week. Guide them to maturity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> If we proceed in this progressive, orderly way, our field service</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAVELING IN EUROPE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> of March, 1959, invited all dedicated publishers who would travel for business or pleasure to Poland, Czechoslovakia or other countries behind the Iron Curtain to communicate with the Society’s office. It has come to our attention this year that quite a number have traveled to these countries without communicating. They have had difficulty in getting in touch with the brothers in the countries they have visited and have lost some blessings they could have enjoyed. Because of the difficult conditions for the brothers in the Iron Curtain countries, it would be a very good thing if all who would travel to these Iron Curtain countries notify the Society at least four ■weeks before making the trip. Congregation servants can help in this, and whenever they learn of any publishers making such trips they can notify the Society too, so the Society may know who is traveling to these countries from any country, reports will not skyrocket one month and drop the next, but will reflect a steady flow of publishers who know and appreciate their responsibilities as ministers. And, too, our December’s quota of at least 255,895 publishers praising Jehovah will be assured.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Tend Our Shepherd's Flock Skillfully</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> All dedicated Christians have the responsibility of finding and feeding the sheep of our Shepherd’s flock. How we want to do this work skillfully! All publishers keenly desire to develop skill in teaching and preaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> As an aid to finding and feeding the sheep we have the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book and the new sermon. What joy was ours when we received our first copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book! Remembering, then, our joyful enthusiasm, let us, in the same spirit, bring this Biblestudy aid to all sheeplike persons in our territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What happy results from using the new sermon! A circuit servant writes: “I’m quite impressed with the results of placing the book in the people’s hands early in the sermon. On one occasion I placed four books in five efforts and started studies at two of them.” Another brother writes: “I feel the success With it is perhaps more effective than any sermon I have used heretofore. I gave the sermon not over 18 times and placed nine books and made arrangements to deliver three additional books.” Another reports: “I found using the sermon as the Society suggested brought very good results. Placing the book in their hands was very effective. It captured their attention and held it. In one and a half hours I gave the sermon seven times, placed four books and had orders for two more. The sermon was easy to give; it has simplicity and yet it is practical, holds the attention and puts the point across regarding God’s purpose for man.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> With so many persons taking the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book, how great is the number of potential Bible studies! How, then, can we show skillfulness in our ministry, that these placements may be turned into Bible studies? Keep an accurate house-to-house record. Never neglect to record a placement of the book. Follow through on not-at-homes. Reports one circuit servant: “The service group during the week was in one territory calling on those who were not at home when we covered the entire territory. In addition to fifteen books being placed when covering it the first time, sixteen additional ones were placed when the not-at-homes were called on.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Since 3,250,000 copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book have been printed, we may encounter persons who already have the book. When the householder says, “I have that book,” do you cope with the situation skillfully? Alertly take advantage of the opportunity to start </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> study, if one is not already being conducted. The simplified back-call sermon, described in “Your Service Meetings,” is a great aid in starting studies. Use it not only on back-calls but also when you meet someone who already has the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Tactfulness is an evidence of our ministerial skill. Some householders</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Over a Quarter of a Million Publishers!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> How marvelous to see Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts as his servants ! The report for April’s activity shows an excellent new peak in publishers—250,900—yes, over a quarter of a million for the first time! This is 29,660 more than last year’s average, a fine 13.4-percent</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JUNE “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained” and one booklet, for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR JUNE Tending Our Shepherd’s Flock Skillfully.—Ps. 78:72.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">increase, and well over last April’s peak of 239,418.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Exceptional too was April’s Memorial report. There were 434,795 in attendance, 79,812 more than last year’s 354,983! That increase of 79,812 new ones associating with the do not like to feel obligated; thus some potential Bible studies may be lost on the first call if too much effort is made to get a definite commitment for a regular study. If this is a problem with you, try this : Merely make a definite arrangement for the next visit. Without feeling obligated, the householder will be having a regular study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Showing the skillfulness of undershepherds in tending to our Shepherd’s flock is the fine increase in Bible studies. All publishers have done commendably. Consider the congregation publishers: In 1954 the average Bible study per publisher was .4. In 1955, 1956, 1957, it rose to .5. In 1958, it increased to .6; last year it rose to .7. Pioneers have progressed from 3.9 to 5.1, and special pioneers from 6.1 to 8.9 during the same period of time. May 1960 bring further progress toward our goal of one Bible study per congregation publisher!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">New World society in the U.S. alone represents nearly as many as joined the ranks of Kingdom publishers throughout the entire world last year! The special public meeting attendance was also outstanding, reaching 279,634, up 32,458 from last year’s 247,176.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> During April 4,893,198 magazines were placed, to compare with last April’s 4,210,697. Average placements for publishers, pioneers and special pioneers all increased over last April. If two magazines were placed at each home, it means that more than 2,400,000 homes received the life-giving message that can start them off on the road to the new world. During the entire </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign 451,206 new subscriptions were obtained—a good increase over last year’s 439,108.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Tending Our Shepherd’s Flock Skillfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of the main article “Tend Our Shepherd’s Flock Skillfully.” Open this part with a 3- or 4-minute talk on the theme for the month, “Tending Our Shepherd’s Flock Skillfully.” (See “Watchtower,” June 15, 1959, p. 361, and June 1, I960, p. 344.) If the circuit servant will visit your congregation within a month or two, bring out that there is room for many more to share in afternoon back-call and Bible study work. The circuit servant (and his wife, if married) will gladly work with publishers, going along on studies or on back-calls to start studies. Overseers are to arrange appointments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">30 min: Demonstration on “Various Ways to Start Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Chairman states importance of following up all “Paradise” book placements by starting study on initial call, by using book and showing how to study on second call or by giving a back-call sermon. Easy-to-use new sermon can be used by all to start studies. Each way to be demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 min.) On initial call, publisher concludes house-to-house sermon with Psalm 37: 10, 11, places book and says to householder: “Allow me to demonstrate to you how the book may be used to gain further information on God’s purpose for man. The questions on the bottom of each page can help you pick out the main point in each paragraph and can be used to discuss the book with others. On page 9, paragraph 1, [turn to page 9] the question asks, ‘What is a paradise?’ What is your thought?” Chairman breaks in and remarks*. “After several paragraphs are discussed arrangements are made to return next week to continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 min.) Chairman: Sometimes on back-calls a study can be started without giving a back-call sermon. Publisher demonstrates: After introducing himself, he says: “Last week when I left with you the book ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained’ you will recall I mentioned that Psalm 37: 10, 11 showed there would be an end to wickedness and that meek persons &quot;would inherit the earth. If I may, I would like to step in for just a few moments and show you how the book can be used to gain much information on paradise and its restoration. If your copy is handy I’ll show you in it what I have in mind . . .” Then (as in above demonstration) publisher proceeds to demonstrate use of book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(8 min.) Chairman discusses &quot;with audience easy new back-call sermon. Suggested introduction might be: “Since you demonstrated sincere interest in what the Bible has to say concerning God’s purpose for man, I made a special effort to come back to share with you more information on the subject. The Bible tells us a great deal as to what we can expect in the restored paradise when God’s purpose for man is realized. As you will recall we referred to Psalm 37:10, 11 last week [open book to page 222, par. 11; show householder] where it shows that God will destroy the wicked, and the meek ones with inherit the earth . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Righteous government to rule (Page </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">222,</span><span class="font7"> par. 10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isa. 9: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font7">As Jesus cured sickness, so ail will have perfect health in restored earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Page 223, par. 14) Matt. 4: 23 Even death will be abolished</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(Page 223, par. 17) 1 Cor. 15: 25, 26 Families would enjoy paradise conditions together everlastingly</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(See picture on page 224.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This book was provided to help us learn how to gain life in paradise restored on earth. Undoubtedly you have wondered, ‘What is a paradise? What will it be like?’ Let us turn to page 9, paragraph 1, and see what it has to say.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chairman: Sermon may be enlarged to include additional scriptures if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(10 min.) Sermon demonstrated by competent publisher prepared in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Chairman: Be versatile. Use whatever method is most practical. If possible, start studies on initial call. If not, then arrange definite time to call, keep accurate record of placement and time, and call back to start study. 10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on “Over a Quarter of a Million Publishers!”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Discussion of the pioneer letter either by a family of three or four or by three or four servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: Review and demonstration of back-call sermon under “Various Ways to Start Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on 1 Timothy 4: 13, on page 1, and “No Place for Commercialism.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “Teach New Ones How to Study”—talk and demonstration of points in article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">17 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article “1960 District Assemblies.” Bring in points from “Watchtower,” May 15, 1958, p. 318.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration of points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Proverbs 15: 28, on page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” covering paragraphs 33 through 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">25 min: Demonstration on “Protecting the Sheep.” (Use same family as previous months.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Besides being fed and led, sheep must be protected. As good undershepherds, publishers must be alert, willing to help new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (2 min.) Neighbor lady calls on wife, sees “Watchtower,” denounces Jehovah’s witnesses, saying they are fanatics, hateful, do not go to doctors, let children die, etc. Wife says she did not get that impression. Neighbor replies they put on good front, but once you join them you cannot get away. Wife, disturbed, does not know what to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (2 min.) Husband is approached by friend at work, asked to go bowling that night, fishing on weekend, but explains Christian activity scheduled. Friend counsels husband not to get too involved in religion. Reminds of past good times, convincingly advises to have some fun in life. Husband, weakened, agrees to go on weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (2 min.) Daughter approaches girl friend, asks why she never calls or comes over any more. Was she offended? No, no personal grudge. Finally girl friend reveals: ‘Since you stopped going to church and started associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, I have been warned by various ones, including my minister, to be careful about associating with you.’ Girl friend tells her: ‘Let’s be friends; come back to church.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE IV (3 min.) Family at home. Wife asks if lessons studied. None have, including wife; desire is lacking. Wife relates neighbor’s statements; husband and daughter tell what happened to them. Truth sounded g*ood, but all agree, if it causes this, may be best to stop now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Various pressures, as illustrated, put on new ones. Briefly refer to Jesus’ parable regarding seed sown on rocky places. (Matt. 13: 20, 21) Help needed. Watch how publisher, not knowing what has happened, gives help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE V (10 min.) Publisher arrives, after greeting suggests they start study. Family hesitate. Lessons not prepared. Father suggests study be temporarily discontinued as they are busy. Publisher is sorry to hear this, notes spirit not same, feels there is a deeper problem, encourages them to discuss it with him. He does not want to pry into personal affairs, but knows efforts of Satan (1 Pet. 5: 8) and need for mutual help. (Eccl. 4: 9, 10) Family respond, relate happenings. Publisher explains: (1) They have heard falsehoods, half-truths, and appeals to selfishness. We are not fanatics, but put pleasure in proper place. Actually, Christian course brings greatest joy. (2) This is a test from Satan, shows you are doing right. (Matt. 5: 11, 12) Consider examples of integrity keepers. Live Christian lives, stand firm. True friends will respect your stand, may eventually listen to message. Why mourn loss of false friends? Cultivate lasting ties with friends in New World society. (Mark 10: 29, 30) (3) Gain strength: Pray. Have faith in God’s help. Study. Associate with New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Family express deep appreciation for help, determine to hold fast. Ask publisher to return next week and they will be ready for study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Sheep rescued from traj?, strength revived. Be alert to note signs of danger, take positive action. Let no sheep stray due to neglect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include “Yearbook” experience on page 101, showing new ones need help, encouragement and continual assistance.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FIFTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Congregations having a fifth service meeting will arrange their own program, taking into consideration counsel offered by the circuit servant on his latest visit.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1960 District Assemblies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>A joyful occasion is the assembling of Jehovah’s people for instruction ! The time for gathering at Peace-pursuing District Assemblies is at hand. Are your plans made to attend and share this joy? If you expect to attend June assemblies you should make your arrangements immediately by sending your rooming requests to the convention city. If you plan to attend assemblies in July or August, send in your Room Request form to the convention city six weeks prior to the assembly date. Volunteer service slips should also be filled out and turned in to your congregation servant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>2</sup> Attend Ari Sessions : Plan to be present during the entire four days. Our purpose in coming is to take in accurate knowledge and to aid our growth to maturity. So be at the assembly from the opening day, Thursday afternoon at 1:50, to the conclusion Sunday afternoon at 5 : 45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>3</sup> What to Being : Each member of the family will want to bring along a pad for taking notes, a Bible and a songbook. These will enable you to share in every session. Notes are useful in helping people of good will, when talking with our brothers and as a review at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> A number of teaching programs are scheduled during the assembly, one of which is on Saturday at 6: 45 p.m. Everyone attending this session should have the current </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> to be studied that week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>5</sup> Field Service : We want to be generous with the good things Jehovah has given us and manifest it by sharing in the field service during the mornings of the assembly when no meetings are scheduled. It will not be necessary to go to the convention grounds for service unless you wish to. If you obtain territory in advance, you may go directly to your assignment in the morning. Before leaving your room for the field, we suggest reading the morning text. Have the comment and prayer, and perhaps someone in the group can demonstrate the sermon. This arrangement will allow us to spend more time in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> When staying in private homes you have further opportunities to witness. Invite these people to the peace-pursuing course of Jehovah’s</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Quarter of a Million Publishers </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> This encouraging report should stir us to continued zealous activity, especially on behalf of the newer ones. Help all these new ones to associate regularly with the New World society, grow to maturity and become capable teachers. witnesses. Invite them to attend the assembly with you, especially the public meeting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Also, it would be well to take literature to place on your way to the assembly—particularly your supply of magazines. Additional supplies can be obtained there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>8</sup> Deportment : Over the years we have gained a fine reputation for our conduct at assemblies. As far as we are concerned, it is the way we live every day, but to the old world it is amazing, and they comment on it in their newspapers, particularly when we are together in large numbers. Worldly persons who have trouble managing delinquent children are impressed when parents keep their children under control and do not permit them to walk about during assembly sessions. Others observing our Christian conduct may be moved to listen to the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> By our attendance at the Peacepursuing District Assemblies we can be assured of rich spiritual blessings from Jehovah that will make our hearts overflow in gratitude to him. It is a grand opportunity to give testimony to Jehovah’s name and to draw closer in love toward our' brothers.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach New Ones How to Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Progress to maturity is directly affected by one’s diligence in personal study. For that reason we should encourage those with whom we study to prepare their lesson in advance right from the start. Show them that the sincerity of their prayer to God for knowledge of his purposes is demonstrated by their earnestness in studying his Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In most cases it is necessary to do more than encourage new ones to study; we must teach them how to do it. Show them how you mark your answers, selecting only key words and phrases. Stress the importance of looking up all scriptures cited and ascertaining their relation to what is in the paragraph. Encourage them to reason on the material in the lesson, seeking reasons for the statements made. Their understanding will be enlarged if they learn to think about the relationship of new points learned to truths already known. At the end of any study period they will find it helpful to review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Their progress will be stimulated when they fully appreciate the reason for study. Point out that the acquiring of knowledge is not the only goal toward which they are striving, but that they should have in mind that Christians should be ‘ready always to make a defense before everyone that demands a reason for the hope in them.’ (1 Pet. 3:15) They should also be encouraged to analyze the material studied in relation to their own lives, asking themselves : What bearing might this have on personal decisions I might have to make? What does it call on me to do now?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When new ones ask Bible questions, alert publishers often seize this opportunity to help them learn how to study. Instead of simply giving the answer, they may take time to help the new one to find the answer. In this way they teach him how to use a concordance and the indexes in the Society’s publications, and the benefit of the library at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It is important to have a regular schedule for personal study and then to stick to it. At first their schedule may involve simply setting aside a specific time to prepare for the home Bible study. Progressively encourage them to expand that program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Never forget, too, that we need Jehovah’s blessing when we study, and we should pray for it. Point this out to new ones. It will strengthen their heart appreciation of the truth and call forth Jehovah’s blessing upon their efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation Needed to Teach from House to House</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When a new sermon is presented in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> each publisher should study it. Then at the service meeting the demonstration will help him to get a better grasp of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> After this, final preparation through careful consideration of the sermon should be made so that he thoroughly understands the theme and makes the sermon his own, something he can say clearly, sincerely and enthusiastically, at the same time making the sermon most appealing to the people. Their religion, way of life, objections commonly made, local conditions, seasons, and so forth, are factors demanding attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> An outline helpful to preparation is: (1) Prepare to introduce the message in a manner fitted to the householder and leading to the first text. (2) On each scripture prepare three things: (a) lead up to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Close Co-operation Between Bible Study Servant and Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What is the vital work of the Bible study servant? It is to increase the number of home Bible studies. But how? Basically it is by his working closely with the publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Reports show that many publishers capable of conducting home Bible studies have not yet started to enjoy this service. How this underscores the need for the Bible study servant’s taking a greater personal interest in the publishers I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The Bible study servant should make appointments to go with publishers who have back-calls that may be turned into studies. He can help get new studies started. He should also discuss the progress of studies already being held by publishers and offer to go along and be of assistance in aiding good-will persons to become doers of the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Increasing studies will call for co-operation, too, on the part of all publishers. Be glad for the Bible study servant’s offer to work with you. Do not regard the Bible study text; (b) read it with force and meaning, emphasizing the theme; (c) apply the text by simple explanation or illustration. (3) Prepare, at definite places in the sermon, a question or remark to draw the householder into conversation. (4) Prepare what you will say to place the book and to start a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> As you approach each succeeding text, prepare definitely what to say so that the listener will be waiting, his expectation excited to hear how the next scripture answers a question raised in his mind. For example, after discussing Isaiah 55:11, you might say: “But the questions come up, How can it be possible? and, Who will be able to enjoy such a paradise? This is cleared up for us here.” (Then read Psalm 37:10, 11.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">servant as being officious when suggesting he go with you on a back-call or study. He is interested in your work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Regard the Bible study servant as a teacher whose aim is to have all capable, qualified publishers conducting one or more Bible studies. “This servant will assist all publishers to get into this back-call and Bible study activity,” says </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span><span class="font9"> “He will be able to help many personally to start in this work.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Reporting your Bible studies promptly at the end of the month is essential, too. While late reports might be counted on the next month’s report to the Society, this should not be necessary. Those who habitually report late might be given tactful counsel by the Bible study servant or congregation servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> That is the way to more Bible studies—the Bible study servant’s taking a greater personal interest in the publishers and the publishers’ cooperating, to the end that the congregation will “go on bearing fruit in every good work.”—Col. 1:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">No Place for Commercialism</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has come to the attention of the Society that some brothers have been taking advantage of their theocratic association to approach brothers and persons of good will to sell their products. As has been brought out in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> it is entirely improper for congregation servants, pioneers or publishers to sell or make contacts for selling products at the Kingdom Hall, at book studies or at assemblies. Brothers should not use their position as a servant, a pioneer or as a publisher to call upon other brothers or persons of good will to sell their' products. If a person wishes to engage in selling for a living, it is his personal business, but never should he misuse theocratic contacts and friendship as an outlet for the products he sells. This announcement is to answer the many inquiries received and to put all brothers on guard against these who would inject commercialism into the theocratic organization.</span></p>

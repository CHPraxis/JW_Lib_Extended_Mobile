<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Sermsis</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>J</sup>A splendid new sermon on “Prayers That God Hears” will help you start the twenty-second </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign with enthusiasm. It is a field-tested sermon that has strong appeal and has brought good results in many parts of the country. By means of it one circuit servant placed the offer with nine householders in one day, and his wife had equal success. Another said: “The sermon on prayer holds the attention of the householders and gets excellent results.” Practice the sermon until you are thoroughly familiar with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">- Deliver the sermon at every door with earnestness, and make the subscription offer with enthusiasm, knowing that what you are presenting will help people make their minds over for the new world. It means peace, happiness and hope for them. You know from personal experience that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> is invaluable for this mental and spiritual transformation. (Eph. 4: 23; Rom. 12:2) Even if a new subscriber reads only an occasional article throughout the year, the truth’s transforming force can still operate on him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Do not forget to study with new subscribers. Try starting a study on the first call by using a study booklet. Explain that it is a reprint, of a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> article. Call back on all subscribers. On each successive call point out interesting articles and statements in the new issues, that they may have a keener desire to read </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and to study regularly. Excellent progress is shown nearly every month in the home Bible study activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As we. share in this. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">campaign, let us pray that Jehovah will bless our endeavors to find and feed his sheep. Consistent with our prayer, let us be sure we are prepared to present the message effectively.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Subscription Quotas</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The quota each publisher will want to aim for is two subscriptions. Pioneers will strive for twenty, while special pioneers will seek thirty. No doubt, many will exceed these quotas. Each congregation may find it helpful to make up a neat chart that shows the local progress in the campaign. However, it should not be left up during Sunday’s meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The offer will be a subscription for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> for one dollar with a gift of three booklets, or an offer of subscriptions for both </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Atoake!</span><span class="font13"> for two dollars with a gift of six booklets. Congregation publishers will turn in 9()c for every new subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> With, the same splendid effort as in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> campaign, we can expect the best </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign yet.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Give everyone you meet the opportunity to let </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">transform his mind for the new world. Offer it regularly from house to house, also to those with whom you conduct Bible studies and others. If a person speaks a foreign tongue better than English, encourage him to subscribe in that language. Have on band copies in the various languages spoken in your territory. Yes, take advantage of every opportunity to offer the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> subscription.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The Society is happy to announce the release of the booklet </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Preachiny and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span><span class="font13"> How appropriate it. is in view of our new yeartext! How fitting, too, in view of the emphasis that the Scriptures place on our both preaching and teaching!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When we understand the position and responsibilities of our brothers and when we have in mind the general organizational pattern that is followed in carrying out the work that Jehovah God has given us to do, we can work in peace and unity. This is part of making our minds over for the new world. The booklet offers practical suggestions that unify us and that help us to find joy in the ministry as we see the results of well-organized activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> While the booklet contains the same basic instructions as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity,</span><span class="font13"> it has been brought up to date. It also helps each minister to appreciate that all the activities of his life are part of his ministry, and that he must individually maintain proper balance in time devoted to these responsibilities. It points out that there are many times to share in the field ministry, not only weekends, and each one should work out a balanced schedule that fits his circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Early in January the Society will ship these booklets to the congregations on consignment, and congregation servants should see that each baptized person receives his copy. The name and address of the individual minister should be printed in the space provided, and the congregation servant will sign the booklet when it is issued. These booklets are not to be stocked by congregations, but they may be ordered for newly baptized publishers as needed following your original consignment. Arrangements will be made to study this new booklet in the service meeting.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Making the Mind Over for the New World.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk on theme for the month, “Making the Mind Over for the New World.” (See “Watchtower,” January 1, 1960, p. 32.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the articles “New Sermon” and “Subscription Quotas” on front page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font12"> min: New sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 mln.) Chairman. “Watchtower” campaign to be biggest ever. Let people know that magazine offers mature guidance in Bible study, puts emphasis on doing God’s will and is answer to Bible students’ prayer. New sermon will teach people the importance of right prayer to Jehovah. All should learn and use it effectively. Entire congregation to discuss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(12 min.) Chairman discusses with audience. (Put sermon on blackboard or on sign before audience so all can see.) First requisite is introduction that will sharply draw attention to subject and gain interest. Following one is field-tested and found most practical: “My name is ---. My pur</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">pose in calling is to discuss briefly the importance of prayer. Most people respect prayer and pray for peace, health, prosperity and many other things. Have you ever -wondered, though, why some prayers are apparently heard and answered and others are not? [Let them reply.] God is not partial, for he invites all men to pray to him. But the Bible shows that a favorable response from God depends on our own attitude and the manner in which we offer prayers. The psalmist puts it this way . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Prayers That God Hears God does listen to prayers of men</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ps. 145: 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Unrighteous not heard, unless wrong course stopped Isa. 1:15-17</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For what should we properly pray? Jesus emphasized the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Matt. 6: 9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Kingdom brings answer to proper</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">hopes and prayers Rev. 21:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Conclusion should focus attention on importance of understanding and doing God’s will so oui’ prayers will be answ<sup>T</sup>ered. We could conclude by saying: “From our discussion we have learned that the Bible makes it clear that it is proper for us to pray to God, but some prayers are not answered because those praying are not in harmony with God’s will. Our prayers for peace, good health, prosperity and such matters of importance to us find their answer through the kingdom that Jesus taught us to pray for. I’ve gained much knowledge on the important Bible subjects of prayer and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom from reading ‘The </span><span class="font12">Watchtower.’ [Bring out magazine.] In this issue on page . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Other introductions and conclusions can be used to give different slants on subject of prayer. Be versatile, use ear-catching expressions that will awaken interest in “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(6 min.) Publisher who is good teacher and well prepared demonstrates use of sermon on “Brayers That God Hears.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) United use of sermon will drive home need of prayer. Practice use of it at home and at service centers, then make use of it in field service. “Watchtower” campaign will be best yet if we are well prepared</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">by studying articles in magazine before presenting them and can attract interest through interesting sermon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">20 min: Talk on new yeartext and article “New Service Aid” on front page. (See “Watchtower” of December 15, 1959.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments, including encouraging counsel to aid new ones started in December to continue to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">3 min: Welcoming comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Make Good Use of the ‘Yearbook,’ Calendar and Bound Volumes” and demonstration of what article discusses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Reports from Literature and Accounts servants regarding their visit with the congregation servant. Each will highlight changes publishers should know about new account system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">22 min: Overcoming Objections to Place the “Watchtower” Subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) To place the “Watchtower” subscription, not only must we have the sermon well in mind, but also how to overcome objections. Common objections encountered are (1) “I’m busy.” (2) “I have my own church magazines.” (3) “I have enough mag'azines.” How would you overcome them? Let’s look in on a family in the community Sunday ■ morning about the time you call, to see what is in their mind and how objections may be met and overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Husband and wife are seated reading, husband a news magazine and wife a church journal. Husband comments on difficult state of world affairs and need for remedy. Wife rejoins that her magazine has no bad news except that church contributions are lagging. Expresses wish church journal would have more articles explaining Bible. Noticing an announcement of “Husband </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Night” </span><span class="font12">Tuesday, she ^encourages him to accompany her. 'He reluctantly agrees, admitting he does need a little religion. Daughter enters with Sunday paper, giving father news section, while keeping comic strip for herself. Father suggests she spend more time improving her mind. She replies, “I’m too busy with school and work.” Mother asks if that means she is too busy to attend movies that evening. Daughter admits, “I’m not that busy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(13 min.) Chairman points out this is typical of many families in territory. They are disturbed about world, news, disappointed at lack of spiritual food in church papers, and not as busy as they would like others to think. What this family needs is “The Watchtower.” But, how would they respond to our 3- to 8-minute sermon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Doorbell rings. Lady of house answers. Briefly pantomime listening to publisher’s sermon. When “Watchtower” is presented she says: “I have my own church magazines.” Chairman reminds audience that this is only</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">an excuse, as shown by her discussion with husband earlier. Receives suggestions from audience on how they would meet objection. In conclusion of part, publisher demonstrates how to overcome objection and obtain subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Housewife resumes seat, bell rings again, husband answers. His objection: “I have enough magazines.” After audience suggestions, publisher demonstrates how to answer objection and obtains subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Husband resumes seat, bell rings again, daughter answers, objecting, “I’m too busy even to read the paper.” Audience offers suggestions, and, in conclusion, publisher overcomes objection and subscription is obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Conductor sums up, emphasizing that objections can be steppingstones to placements if publishers realize they are often merely excuses and many times can be overcome quickly and tactfully. Encourage publishers to (1) note interest found, (2) make return calls and start studies, (3) direct interested ones to organization, and (4) aid new ones to become praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(Note: In February provision will be made on a service meeting to make return call and start study with this family used in demonstration; in March, to direct the family to organization, and in April, to start them in the field work. Use same group of publishers for each if possible. Publishers starting and now conducting studies should have same goal.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY 5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Congregation Organization.” Cover material with questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Round-table discussion of article “Be a Teacher—Directing New Ones to the Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">22 min: “Directing New Ones to the Organization by Discussions After Home Bible Studies.” To be handled by school servant. Some parts can be covered with talk, or pantomime, while others can be demonstrated in full or in part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Part I: Demonstration showing tw<sup>T</sup>o brief scenes designed to acquaint person of good will with organization and stimulate desire to associate with it. Each </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">one should deal with</span><span class="font12"> a different meeting. (See “Qualified to Be Ministers”, Study 55.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Part II: Series of brief demonstrations showing what can be done week by week to prepare new one for service: (1) Tell personal house-to-house experience or use one from “Yearbook” and show Scriptural reason for doing work this way. Help good-will person to see the urgent need of sharing message with, others. (2) Explain moral standards of New World society. (3) Tell about arrangements to train new ones in ministry. (4) Help good-will person to learn current sermon from “Kingdom Ministry.” At end of last one in series, make definite arrangements to take person along in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on Col. 1: 10, at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations having a fifth service meeting will arrange their own program.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION ORGANIZATION</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Counting Time Spent Preaching</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Millions of hours are regularly spent by over four fifths of a million publishers throughout the world preaching the good news. In the United States alone the staggering total of 36,890,221 hours was spent in preaching during the 1959 service year! When figures get into the millions we are impressed, but the meaning behind them is better appreciated when we break them down to see how they apply to us individually. If we isolate an average congregation publisher’s hours from this vast figure, they amount to 10.4 hours each month; for the regular pioneer, 93.1: and for the special pioneer, 142.4. Added together, what a mighty shout of praise to Jehovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> During the past five years we have seen the total hours devoted to preaching in the United States increase from 24,417,154 to 36,890,221. This means that the Master of the harvest is answering our plea for more workers in the harvest, and the more we preach and teach, the more persons we aid to know the way to life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What is included in this report of time devoted to the ministry? Time spent preaching the Kingdom message to the public and to persons who are not yet baptized. When witnessing from house to house, making back-calls or conducting home Bible studies, each minister counts the time from when he calls at the first house in the area where</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Under separate cover each congregation will receive two sets of the new and improved Instructions for Congregation Accounting and sufficient forms to put the system into operation January 1, 1960. One copy is for the accounts servant and the other is to be read by the literature and magazine-territory servants before being filed by the congregation servant. When the congregation servant meets with the accounts and literature servants early in January, they should thoroughly study the new system together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&amp; The outlines for the 1960 series of public talks are being sent to each congregation. When they are received, the congregation servant should assign the talks to those who are Qualified public speakers. It may be that the committee will want to consider adding some who now qualify to the list of speakers, as outlined in paragraph 134 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span><span class="font12"> The new series will begin on April 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Starting March 6, circuit servants will give the public talk “What Does It Mean to Be a Christian?” Sometime in February, as directed by the Society, district servants will commence giving the talk “Finding Peace in This Troubled World.” </span><span class="font13">he plans to do his witnessing until he leaves his last call. It is true that some householders may not be at home, but even calling at these homes is part of carrying on the ministry “from house to house.” Time devoted to witnessing publicly on the streets and incidental preaching is also reported.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> This does not mean that congregation publishers devote only 10.4 hours to their ministry each month, or that pioneers devote only 93.1, and so forth. By no means! Everything we do in life is governed by the fact that we are Christians. Studying God’s Word, attending meetings, providing for one’s family, one’s daily conduct are all part of the life of a Christian—all part of the ministry. So, staggering as the report of 36,890,221 hours is, that is only a small part of the time devoted by Jehovah’s witnesses to their ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Reporting the results of our activities in the actual field service is incidental; it is the service that honors Jehovah that is important. Yet we are all interested in the combined results, whicli reveal how Jehovah is blessing our efforts. The report encourages us, shows us where there is room for improvement, and enables the organization to supply us with equipment for the ministry. Therefore, it is good for all to appreciate the value of reporting. Keep a personal record of your activity on the weekly report slip and turn this, in each week.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">January is Alien Address Report month. Any who are not U.S. citizens should remember that the government requires them to fill out an address report card (Form 1-53) this month. It may be obtained at any post office or immigration office, filled out. and left with the clerk there.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Doctrinal truths are taught at the home Bible study. How, then, can we teach good-will persons about God’s organization and the public ministry performed by that organization? Mention the organization in prayer, thanking Jehovah for it and for the aids it provides. After closing prayer follow through with the suggestions in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font13"> Study 55.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Begin this teaching program with the very first study. No rule can be set as to how fast to proceed in directing them to the organization. Each person is different. Discern what their needs are; teach them progressively, laying a basis for each forward step you wish them to take.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Where will the publisher find material for his week-by-week program? Use the Bible. Discuss material in such chapters as Matthew 25 and Ezekiel 9, bringing in the organization and the ministry. Sometimes use excerpts from Society publications. Abundant material is available: The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, “Make Sure of All Things,” Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> convention reports, news clippings, the ministry school schedule, experiences, and so forth. Teach good-w’ill persons so that they see the need for and have a desire to attend meetings, have a share in the field ministry and make a dedication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Give new ones a knowledge of the meetings and the way the field ministry is performed. Explain the provision made for new ones to accompany someone who is experienced in the ministry. Before Inviting anyone into the service, explain the Scriptural principles adhered to by the New World society regarding honesty, drunkenness and relations between the sexes, and that one must live by them before engaging in the field ministry. Explain the urgent need for others to hear the message. Help them little by little to learn the current sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> After a person attends meetings and shares in the ministry, keep on teaching him. Teach him about the servants and their duties. Introduce some of the servants each week. Teach him how to obtain literature and use the various forms. Teach him gradually the modern-day history of the organization. Teach him how the organization meets its expenses the Scriptural way. Use discernment in applying these suggestions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The subject of prayer will appeal to people of almost all religions and to many who have no church affiliations. In giving your introduction it is best to get to the point immediately so that the person will see that you have a definite purpose in your call. Focus his thoughts quickly on a certain theme connected with prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> To approach the sermon from the viewpoint of how our prayers can be answered you could begin by saying: “Good morning. I am Mr.----, a minister making a brief</span></p></li></ul>

In a world of growing wickedness, crime and communism, many people are turning to prayer, yet it is evident that not all prayers are answered even though these might be offered in sincerity. How can one be sure his prayers will be answered? That it is proper to expect God to answer prayer is shown by the psalmist David in these words . . .” (Read Fsalm 145: 18.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazine Distribution!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “The Catholic Church in the 20th Century” is the striking theme of the timely October 8 special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> “Security During ‘War of the Great Day of God the Almighty’ ” is the main article in the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font10">What a powerful message they contain! Read your copies as soon as they arrive. You will be anxious to get them into the hands of others! These issues are specially designed to help sheeplike ones to break free from religious bondage and set their feet on the road to life in the new world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Society would like to give these magazines as wide a distribution as possible, and when you read them you too will want everyone in your territory to do the same. It is suggested that during October publisheis place at least ten copies of each of these issues, and pioneers 75. During April we placed 4,893,198 magazines. In October, with all of us working hard to get this vital information before the public, it may be possible to match or even exceed that report. Knowing that when you read your personal copies, you will want additional supplies of these magazines, the Society would like to encourage congregations to send in additional orders for as many as can be used. The printing plates will be kept on hand by the Society so that more copies can be printed any time during the month of October.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Make good use of teaching principles when placing these issues. Stimulate the interest of householders in the theme of the magazine or In a particular article so they will want to read it. Tell them you would like to call back for their comments, and keep an accurate record of placements so return visits can be made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Subscriptions Fill Need</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Meek ones need more than one copy of the magazine to be taught the way to new-world life. They need a continuous program of teaching. An </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscription will help to fill this need. Our goal during October, therefore, will be for each publisher to place one subscription, each pioneer five and each special pioneer eight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Your Midweek Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There is much that can be done to improve midweek service arrangements for brothers who work nights, for publishers who find it difficult to share in the service on weekends, for sisters with children, for school children, as well as for others who enjoy a full share in the ministry. These times can be used to present the regular offer or just the mag-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">? OFFER FOR OCTOBER 2 2 Subscription for “Awake!”, with j t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three booklets, for $1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping “Clean from the Blood 2 of All Men.”—Acts 20 : 26. J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">azines. Below are six helpful suggestions :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(1) Study conductors should make definite midweek service arrangements for those in their respective groups, wherever possible. The time and place of meeting as well as which publishers will be working with the group can be announced each week after the congregation book study. This will encourage others to come out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(2) Arrange for pioneers to take the lead in midweek group witnessing. One congregation in Brooklyn, New York, with seven pioneers, arranged to have the publishers meet each morning at the Kingdom Hall,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> How will we obtain the most subscriptions? By going from house to house! Continue to use the current sermon, “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” if you wish. Since we are familiar with it, we can effectively adapt it to the offer of an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscription, with three booklets, for $1. If the householder already has </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> coming to his home, then offer a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watehtoioer</span><span class="font10"> subscription. Pioneers and publishers </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font10">with a different pioneer<sup>-</sup> handling the field service arrangements each day. This has proved very successful. Call on vacation pioneers to help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(3) In Cleveland, Ohio, a congregation doubled its average magazines per publisher per month within six months by scheduling service each day of the week, with a different service center being responsible for the service arrangements each day. Other forms of activity improved too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(4) Where there are no pioneers available, any mature brother or sister can be assigned to oversee the midweek work. Let one take the lead; another can act as an assistant. Between them they can make sure that someone will always be at the place of meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(5) Some congregations have arranged for two or three service centers to meet at one central point. One congregation has found it advantageous to have one centralized midweek service meeting place. Mature sisters handle the service arrangements whenever the brothers are not present. They report that over fifteen mothers, plus many persons of good will, support the arrangement. These mothers bring their children along. One or two sisters care for the small children, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font9">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Keeping- “Clean from the Blood of All Men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Keeping‘Clean from the Blood of All Men.’ ” (See “Watchtower,” November 1, 1959, pp. 645-662, and October 1, 1960, p. 607.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Keep ‘Clean from the Blood of All Men.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Presenting- the Good News.” Discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Our Ministry During 1960.” Show what good was done by the congregation during past service year and where you might improve in 1961. Rejoice in your blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: New World News report and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: “Yearbook” experiences on how “Good News” booklet was used to start studies: pages 112, 252, 230.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">23 min: Using Bible and “Good News” booklet together in back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publishers should bring “This Good News of the King'dom” and their Bibles with them to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman: Back-call sermon outlined in August “Kingdom Ministry” has proved most effective for immediate starting of studies. Brothers appreciate its simplicity, ease of use. It is both most effective and easiest when booklet and Bible are tied together throughout sermon. Scriptures should be read from householder’s Bible while the booklet is actually being studied as outlined in the sermon. Just how can tills be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(15 min.) Chairman gives sermon to audience as outlined in August “Kingdom Ministry.” Have someone in audience prepared to represent the congregation respond as householder. After introduction and being “invited in,” chairman tactfully asks audience to get “Good News” booklet and Bible. Briefly review points of door-to-door sermon with questions, such as, “Where did we learn God’s will was going to be done?” “What conditions will pass away when God’s will is done?” Read Micah 4:3 to tie in with this. “Verse 4 shows something else will pass away: fear. What are some causes of fear?” Let householder comment, then turn to par. 42. Point out scripture quoted just as it appears in Bible. Invite householder to read opening-sentences of paragraph, then discuss how causes of fear will pass away. Going on: “Is peace needed anywhere other than among men?” Show Bible’s promise in sentence following Micah 4:3, 4 in par. 42, and discuss it. Look up and read Isaiah 11: 6-9 in Bibles and discuss. Entire paragraph has been considered; note questions covering it to test whether points grasped. Continue: “What kingdom did the Lord’s prayer tell us would bring this?” See what par. 43 says about it. Have householder read paragraph up to Psalm 72: 1-5 and discuss it. Look up Psalm 72: 1-5 in Bible and discuss it. “Whom is the psalmist speaking to?” “Hence, this is a prayer.” Consider question on par.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">43. Bring out: Prayer shows peace will come; by means of Kingdom; Christ Jesus ruler; last forever; this is good news. Paragraph 3 of booklet calls it just that. Read question on paragraph, discuss it, then read paragraph and further discuss it, explaining how booklet helps us consider Bible texts to learn this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5 min.) Chairman: Study really started. Depending on time, take another paragraph or two, then stir up interest in following material and make definite arrangements for a return visit to continue interesting discussion. Discuss effective simplicity of this back-call sermon. After first scripture, sermon is outlined for us in booklet. With a little preparation everyone can use it effectively. Sermon teaches householder Kingdom hope, proves points from householder’s Bible while building trust in booklet by seeing it tie in with Bible. Study is really under way from outset. Start studies on first call if possible, but even if that does not succeed, sermon used as above will be most effective for starting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. (Include local experiences in placing the October 8 and October 15 issues of the magazines. Plan in advance.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Report from assistant congregation servant, covering- what all can do to have a greater share in Kingdom service. Also discuss, with audience participation, the Congregation Organization article on “Improving Service Meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">24 min: Know Your Magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For this part all in audience should have copies of the October 15 “Watchtower” and October 22 “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Chairman: Enthusiastic talk on importance of information contained in special October 8 “Awake!” and in October 15 “Watchtower.” Discuss effect message will have on lives of those who read it; emphasize importance of wide distribution. Encourage all to continue to use these two issues until all have been placed. When supply of October 8 “Awake!” has been exhausted, then use October 22 issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Important to know contents of mag-' azines for intelligent presentations. . More than usual magazine activity in October requires special preparations. All methods to be used: going from door to door with individual copies and with the subscription offer, offering single copies when subscriptions not taken, from store to store and on the street. Do you know your magazines well enough to use them in all features of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(9 min.) Panel of experts, prepared in advance, called to platform. Three or four articles in the October 22 “Awake!” are discussed with them. The chairman asks them questions designed to bring out talking points that may be used in the field service. In each answer panel should refer to page and paragraph where answer is found so those in audience may follow in their copy of the magazine. After each article is discussed, one of the panel will be called on to give a presentation he will use highlighting that article. One shows what he will say when presenting subscription offer, another when the subscription offer is not taken, and a third demonstrates a 30- to 60-second presentation of the individual issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(9 min.) Same procedure as above followed to cover articles in the October 15 “Watchtower.” Questions may be framed to bring out how different persons might be approached, such as a housewife, man, high-school student, storekeeper, etc. Or questions might be asked to show how certain points in an article would appeal to those of a dominant religious group in the local territory. Give special attention to the main article. When demonstrating (after each article is discussed) how magazines may be presented, panel members should show how they would present magazines to man on the street waiting for a bus, another in store-to-store work, and a third to man sitting in his car in a grocery store parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When “Awake!” is featured, “The Watchtower” should be presented as its companion and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: All should take advantage of opportunities to engage in magazine activity during October. Put good suggestions into use and magazine quota will easily be met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">9 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan based on 2 Timothy 2: 15, on page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FOURTH MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">17 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” covering paragraphs 88 through 93.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Teaching at the Theocratic Ministry School.” Talk and demonstrate points in paragraph 4 on delivery of talks and sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: “Improving Your Midweek Service.” Discussion between two study conductors and assistant congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include encouragement for all to share in final weekend of “Awake!” campaign and to follow up magazines placed. Comment on the text [Titus 2:1] at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Your Midweek Service </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">while the others go out in the service. Mothers and children appreciate the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6) Many families get their children out regularly in midweek service by helping them organize their free time. A particular day each week after school is set aside for magazine work. Children can be made responsible for the territory and for ordering their own magazines. Parental example is the big thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If midweek service is going to be a success, there must be constant supervision by the overseer and the study conductors, each personally checking with the publishers, asking them how things are working out and then making adjustments when necessary.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Service Meetings (Part 3)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Short, well-rounded-out </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">talks</span><span class="font10"> on the service meeting add variety and weight to the program. To be effective, each should have a Scriptural theme and should present reasonable and workable suggestions and admonition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If the points in a service meeting talk are outlined by the Society, the speaker should build his talk around these and tie the talk in with the theme of the meeting. If the talk is not outlined by the Society, the one assigned should first get clearly in mind the reason for the talk and the effect it should have on the congregation. If it is to deal with a congregation problem, ascertain the cause of the problem and how it can be overcome. Scriptures supporting the theme or covering the problem can be applied. The talk should not be abstract, but each publisher should see how he can apply the practical counsel in his own ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A talk is made doubly effective with appropriate illustrations. If they are used to explain and clarify, the counsel and suggestions given will be remembered longer and applied. All this requires preparation. The one assigned cannot wait until the last minute to put a few thoughts on a piece of paper. The talk must be thought out thoroughly. He must observe the law of proportion, keeping in mind the amount of time allotted. The introduction should not be lengthy, but should lead right into the body. If the talk is to be</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Clean from Blood” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">who desire may offer subscriptions for both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> with six booklets, for $2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> By employing teaching methods we can lay the groundwork for Bible studies. Where possible start studies on the first call, using the booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font10"> Its use in starting studies on back-calls will be demonstrated on the second service meeting this month, and study conductors will review this back-call sermon on the following Sunday morning, to encourage its use after house-to-house work that day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> One sister who placed an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">subscription wrote: “The next week I returned and started a study in the booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’ ”</span><span class="font10"> The result? “They are now attending meetings, and arrangements are being made to take them out in the service. The best of all is that from this one subscription there</span></p></li></ul>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">fifteen minutes in length, then prepare only fourteen minutes, just In case elaboration on one or two points takes a little more time. Taking more than the time assigned is unfair to others on the program as well as those in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In introducing the service meeting, the congregation servant need not handle the welcome and consideration of the text at every service meeting, but capable, enthusiastic brothers should always handle this in order to get the meeting started off right. Each brother handling succeeding parts should introduce the brother who follows him. There are a variety of ways this can be done. Avoid overuse of the phrase, “Now we will hear from,” or, “We will turn the platform over to,” and so forth. Use fifteen seconds to state very briefly what feature follows and introduce the brother by name. Each one should emphasize the theme. This will tie the whole meeting together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup>Concluding announcements should be well thought out by the congregation servant, and it is usually preferable that he make these at each service meeting. Time is limited, so he should make the time count. Occasionally there are letters to be read or special arrangements to be discussed, not included in the outline, but careful planning will avoid going overtime if you adjust the program before the meeting starts. Talks on the service meeting, whether a few minutes or longer, should all be pointed and practical.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Have you tried working with the magazines at shopping centers? Many brothers report good results by going to the cars, where often some member of the family is waiting for those who are shopping. It has proved to be an excellent way to place magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Make good use of the October 8 and 15 issues and be magazineconscious all month. By bearing our own load of responsibility, we will work toward being free from the blood of all men.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching at the Theocratic Ministry School</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The theocratic ministry school is provided by Jehovah to help us become effective teachers. Taking the lead as a teacher at this meeting is the school servant, who must always strive to help all to develop greater teaching ability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The servant should analyze the teaching ability of each student and constantly seek to improve it. When offering suggestions on overcoming weaknesses, he should be sure that the student understands the counsel given and appreciates its value. As opportunity affords, do more; offer private assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Counsel should be designed to stimulate constant progress. However, when a student makes some improvement on a major weakness, it is not always advisable to pass on quickly to other weaknesses. This may slow down progress being made by focusing his attention elsewhere. In some cases it may do more good simply to commend the student for solid improvement, emphasize the value of the good quality he is developing and encourage him to continue to give it attention. The student will get a sense of achievement as he overcomes this weakness. If weaknesses are always highlighted no matter how well he does, he may get discouraged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When counseling, bear in mind the type of talk being delivered. For example, in the first student talk, counsel on qualities and methods employed in talks given from the platform. On the other hand, counsel given on house-to-house sermons and back-call presentations should be designed to develop both speakingability and the teaching techniques used in these features of the service, as discussed in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font10">Students should be encouraged to deliver these sermons just as they would in the field service. In fact, it would be beneficial for them to use their sermons in the field ministry, either from house to house or on back-calls, before and after giving them in the school. In this way the theocratic ministry school will provide the most practical instruction for the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is good for the school servant to suggest that the students bring along their textbooks to the meeting. It may be helpful to mark important points in the books in preparation for the written review, as well as for use in the service. With both servant and students working to cultivate teaching ability, all can develop greater effectiveness in the ministry.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font10"> Tim. 2 ; 2.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How well did we do during 1960? Wherein should we try harder? Last December saw 238.879 publishers active, an increase of 8 percent over the previous year’s average. In April we had an all-time peak of 250,900 publishers, a 13.4-pereent increase. For the year we had a 5.1-percent increase, with an average of 232,632 publishers reporting each month. Even though short of our goals, the figures are cause for rejoicing. For the coming year our 10-percent quota, which we hope to reach by December, is 255,895, and our 20-per-cent quota for April is 279,158. Let us begin working now to meet these quotas by preparing new ones for service and keeping regular ourselves. October will be a good month to start new publishers with their using the special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During the 1960 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">campaign of four months we obtained 451,206 subscriptions, representing a nice increase of more than 12,000 over the previous year’s fourmonth campaign. Surely this means that much spiritual food is going into the homes of the people. As for about the policies of the Catholic church. You owe it to yourself to examine official church views on freedom, war, communism and morals. That is why I have made a special effort to bring you this timely issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Using the October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> containing the public talk delivered at the district assemblies, we might say: “I am sure you have wondered whether there will be another world war and if the human race will survive. The Bible gives us many details about a coming war that will affect every single person on earth. You will want to learn what God requires of us if we are to find security during that time. In this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> the article ‘Security During “War of the Great Day of God the Almighty” ’ shows what we must do.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In each case, make it a point to prepare for a back-call by stating you will call back to get the person’s comment on these magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">individual magazine placements, we slipped a little, from 11.9 down to 11,7. Could we be more magazine conscious? Just one magazine may start a person on the way to life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our Memorial report was particularly good. Its total of 434,795 in attendance showed a 22-percent increase over the previous year. What a potential, of some 200,000, to be helped!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> One feature of our report, however, that all of us do well to ponder seriously is our home Bible studies. Apparently because of having clarified just when we could report a study—not until two meetings are held after the initial one and preparations are made to have the study continued—our home Bible studies took a drop: from a high of 207,138 last October to 172,309 this past August. Let each one of us be ever alert to start studies on the initial call and when making back-calls, and then keep them going. Let us be dependable in helping new ones and in reporting the studies. Doing so, our home Bible studies should markedly increase.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST, 1960 “Seek peace and pursue it. For Jehovah’s eyes ore upon fhe righteous.”—1 Pet. 3:11,12. VOL. HI NO. 8</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Use Initiative and Defense in the Ministry</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The wise farmer knows he must take the initiative and go out into the field to harvest his crop. So too with the ingathering of other sheep! Stirred to action by love, as servants of Jehovah we take the initiative by seeking out interested ones to whom we can present and defend the New World hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In the book “Towr </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Will Be Done on Barth”</span><span class="font8"> Jehovah has graciously provided vital information concerning the outcome of the East-West crisis during these momentous years. In August diligent ministers will continue to offer this most timely book with any other available in the congregation, preferably </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font8"> and include </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom” </span><span class="font8">as one of the booklets. The Society is able to fill orders for both of these fine bound books recommended for use. But the householder may have one, or both, already. What then? Carry along extra books as substitutes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> How can we increase our effectiveness and add to our enjoyment in using the current sermon? By preparing our defense! Congregations report excellent results from demonstrating the sermon at service centers each Sunday morning. Writes one study conductor: “Several publishers with my service center have learned and are now using the sermon in house-to-house work because of our encouraging all to learn it, with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> different publisher giving the sermon each Sunday morning. This program has made new and older publishers sermon conscious, and already good results are evident.” Allow for sufficient preparation by assigning these demonstrations in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Why not employ this effective method with the back-call discussion found in this issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry?</span><span class="font8"> First, watch it demonstrated at the service meeting. Then prepare for a review of it at the service center the following Sunday morning. With this kind of preparation publishers will find it as easy to use as the 3- to 8-minute sermon!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Assisting New Ones</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> New ones in our midst need much attention. Mature brothers can take the initiative by assisting these to attend one of the remaining district assemblies this month. How they appreciate help with their travel plans, in attending sessions and participating in the field service there!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>0</sup> Many of the new ones will have symbolized their dedication at the district assemblies. While we delight to see them take their stand, we know that they need continued assistance to progress to real Christian maturity. Do not stop conducting </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">| OFFER FOR AUGUST | J “Your Will Be Done on Earth&quot; and 4 | another book, with two booklets, ? | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for $1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I THEME FOR AUGUST | « Using initiative and Defense in I </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">| Our Ministry.—-1 Pet. 3:13, 15. | </span><span class="font8">home Bible studies with them; completion of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font8"> is vital for their spiritual growth. Lovingly aid their advance to maturity by continued study, even though time spent is not reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Initiative During Summer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> An additional opportunity for fruitful witnessing is in isolated territory. The request for such territories has been gratifying. Many interested people are being contacted. Encourage them to study, and teach them how. What can we do if the regular offer for isolated territory, namely, subscriptions for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toiver</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> is not accepted? Offer some of the other publications. Keep in mind, too, the need for recording this interest so follow-up work can be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> A second avenue for showing initiative is by vacation pioneering, and the response to this privilege of service has been splendid! No doubt there are yet more who plan to enroll this summer. Those of you who are vacation pioneers can do much to encourage other publishers to share in service with you. One sister<sup>-</sup>wrote, saying that she was the only vacation pioneer in the congregation, but never a day went by without having another publisher with her in the service. Make that your goal too!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Vacation time offers a third occasion for using initiative. Vacations are periods of recreation from the standpoint of secular work. Vacation means a change in activity, not just a lack of it. Thus, a stimulating and constructive change enjoyed by publishers while on vacation is to assemble with brothers in other congregations. How encouraging it is to these brothers, especially in smaller communities and isolated groups, to see you at their meetings, hear your comments, and have you participate in the field service with them I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> A fourth way is by increasing our magazine activity. Are you placing your quota of these important magazines each month? In addition to house-to-house and store-to-store work on Magazine Day and offering the magazines when the regular offer is declined, street work can be utilized to good advantage. Many publishers report placing from ten to twenty magazines an hour on the streets by approaching people and talking to them! Also, prestudy work during the longer daylight hours is productive where the conductor organizes activity. Where practical, publishers can be assigned houses to work on their way to the service center. Think of the excellent work that can be done by taking dif-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Using Initiative and Defense in Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font7">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font7">Talk on “Using Initiative and Defense in Our Ministry.’’ (See “Watchtower,” August 1, 1960, p. 464.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the main article “Use Initiative and Defense in the Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min; “Presenting the Good News.” Demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font7">Concluding comments. (Include comments on the text [Col. 4: 6] at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: Talk on importance of being alert to obtain subscriptions for “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” at all times. Use “Yearbook” experiences on pages 119 and 257.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">26 min: Demonstration of back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers should bring “This Good News of the Kingdom” and their Bibles with them to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Chairman talks on need of following up quickly the placements made in July and August. Either use back-call sermon as below or immediately start study (if possible) in “This Good News of the Kingdom” or in one of the books placed with the people. (See June, 1960, “Kingdom Ministry” for ideas.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(11 min.) With sermon on blackboard for publishers to see, chairman discusses it with audience. Publishers can pick out points from paragraphs of “This Good News of the Kingdom” and include them in the discussion. The questions at the bottom of the page for paragraphs 42 and 43 may also be used on the back-call. Study should be started on call. Suggested introduction might be: “When I visited you before, we discussed how God would bring an end to hate and prejudice in the earth. Since then I have examined some other scriptures dealing with the condition of peace brought about by doing God’s will. Most of these are found in the booklet ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ which I left with you. May I step in and discuss them with you?” (If not, continue the discussion at the door, if possible.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: God's Will to Bring Peace to Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Wickedness, war, hate, and fear to vanish gn par. 42 (Mic. 4: 3, 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace between animals and man gn par. 42 (Isa. 11: 6-9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteous King and Kingdom; lasting results gn par. 43 (Ps. 72: 1-5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Time now to learn of Kingdom good news &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gn par. 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From par. 43 and Ps. 72: 1-5, publisher could turn to page 4, par. 3, and ask householder to note question that opens par. 3: “What is ‘this good news’?” and then point out how good news of the Kingdom can be learned by examining the Bible. Show that the booklet is a help, as it discusses God’s purpose for man and offers bright hope for future. Then publisher can go on and discuss a few paragraphs of booklet with householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In concluding the discussion, make arrangements to return to consider some additional points from the booklet and Bible on basic truths that establish what the good news is that is being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(10 min.) Well qualified publisher gives sermon as outlined from “This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Follow-up of placements and interest is essential if good-will people are to be brought into Jehovah’s modern-day ark of safety. Back-call sermons are very helpful in starting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">9 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">25 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Organized Social Entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">23 min: Demonstration on “Establishing the Training Program.” (Use same group as previous months.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) When new ones come into truth, training not finished. Training program will train them to train others. Family seems ready for this training now. Circuit servant not with congregation at present, so congregation servant will make arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (5 min.) Congregation servant considers family's progress with Brother Mature, who conducts study with them, and with their congregation book study conductor; suggests training program for them. Brothers decide husband and wife are ready, but not daughter yet. Servant suggests Mature train husband and Sister-----</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">train wife. Mature is pleased with suggestion. Servant will discuss it with husband and wife and Sister -----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Foundation laid. Now servant will talk with each prospective companion separately. If all are willing and able he will make assignments at next meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (5 min.) Servant commends husband and wife on progress. To see results, time spent in ministry must be used effectively. (1 Cor. 9: 26) Training program explained; both invited to share. They desire to improve, are very willing, express to each other and servant that this training is just what they wanted and needed to make progress in the ministry. He informs thpm that Mature and Sister--would like to help</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">them. If they have time, arrangements can be made after “Watchtower” study Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (5 min.) Servant talking to Mature and husband at Kingdom Hall. He is pleased they both wish to work together, outlines arrangement for them: (1) Scriptural provision. (Luke 10: 1) Emphasize that it is voluntary arrangement. (2) Purpose is for every Witness to be mature, capable of teaching in all features of ministry. When in service, work together first half hour. Mature to set example, kindly analyze husband’s presentations, offer counsel, progressively teach. Work separately for a while, and husband will apply counsel. Last half hour together, so Mature can observe progress. (3) Need definite schedule; stick to it. Time to prepare sermons together; time for service. Discuss possibilities. Work on one thing at a time; progressively aid in each feature of service. (4) Feel free to discuss progress made either with study conductor or congregation servant. Want to help them in every way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Servant will do same with sisters. Companions finish working out schedules privately. Daughter will be aided in assistance program until ready for training program. These publishers have been baptized, but baptism not prerequisite for one to be trained. For effective training program, all take active interest. Congregation servant through personal contact and study conductor’s reports should be alert to make needed changes in training program, see that assignments are really functioning. Study conductors should be alert to needs and possibilities in service centers, make suggestions. All publishers should work hard on training assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">To Those Prejudiced by Listening to Opposers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus was on earth ‘the Pharisees, who were money-lovers, were listening to him, and they began to sneer at him.’ (Luke 16:14) Like persons today create prejudice in the minds of some whom we meet at the door. Such influenced ones may say: “I’ve heard [or, read] about you and don’t want anything to do with you.” We must try to help these people, some of whom may be honest-hearted, to avoid a humiliating error ; “When anyone is replying to a matter before he hears it, that is foolishness on his part and a humiliation.” We should ‘instruct with mildness those not favorably disposed.’—Prov. 18:13; 2 Tim. 2:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> To such you might answer: “Would you like to read the most unbiased account of Jehovah’s witnesses ever written; one that both you and I will accept as authentic? It tells all about Jehovah’s witnesses. It is the Bible. The best one of us was Jesus Christ.” Then you may point to Hebrews 12: 1, 2, Revelation 3:14, or John 17 : 6 and 18 : 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Another reply might be : “Have you wondered why such literature [or, such talk] is devoted to tearing down, but does not build up? Don’t you think the Bible was written to build up in us a hope for something-better than we see today?” Then</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ Literature Offer: September: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font7"> and any other book in stock, with two booklets, for $1. October: Subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">and three booklets, for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Beginning September 4, circuit servants will give the public talk “Seeking Peace with Go£ and .Man,” and the district servants’ public talk will be “Is God Interested in the Affairs of Men?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ An actual-count inventory of literature </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is to</span><span class="font7"> be taken by all congregations on September 1. Two Literature Inventory forms are being sent to each congregation. The original should be filled out and returned to the Society no </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">later than September 3.</span><span class="font7"> Retain the duplicate for congregation files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Identification cards now in use expire August 31, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1960. New cards are </span><span class="font7">available at the rate of two cards for 1c. Only baptized publishers and pioneers who regularly engage in house-to-house work and who are capable of doing so alone qualify for these identification cards, which may be obtained through the congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Those who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">attend, district assemblies in</span><span class="font7"> August should remember to take along a pad for note-taking, a </span><span class="font8">go into the Bible’s Kingdom hope.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> You could say: “I’m sure that you don’t have anything against me as a person, do you? Do you think it is fair to judge eight hundred thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses by what one man [or, a few men] says about them?” Then explain what motivated you to call and the message you bring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> To get into the sermon you might remark: “Did you ever read in the Bible where it said of early Christians : ‘It is known everywhere this sect is spoken against’ ?” Then, turning to Acts 28:22, you can go on to show that the people also said, “But we think it proper to hear from you what youi' thoughts are.” If the person listens, you can show that Paul’s thoughts were not sectarian, but he had the message of the Kingdom (verse 23) ; then go ahead with the sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> One might answer : “I am surprised that anyone would speak against the message of Christ’s kingdom, for I am here to call your attention to God’s words at . . . ” (Here turn to the first scripture in the sermon.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Thus, though you may not always break down the prejudice or find interest, you will be teaching something to cause thinking persons to stop and reason, or your discussion, tactfully conducted, may open the way for a better opportunity to witness on the next call.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Bible and a songbook. For the Saturday-evening program you will want the current </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> to be studied that weekend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> God’s will is that Christians be teachers in all types of territory. (1 Tim. 2 : 4) This requires observation. Observe the predominant religion in a territory and the stock objections. Observe the householder’s special interests or needs. Observe local circumstances. Are workers on strike? Is there mass unemployment? Has there been a local catastrophe?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Such observation lays the foundation for the next step—adaptability. Adapt your sermon to the facts you have observed. Put adaptability into practice both before going to the door and at the door. Try to find out beforehand what the predominant religion in the territory is. Be prepared for stock objections. In a Catholic territory, the minister knows he will hear, “I’m a Catholic.” So he prepares a variety of responses, such as, “Do you have a copy of the Catholic Douay Bible?” (The minister may even carry a copy.) Show adaptability, too, by using phrases familiar to Catholics, such as the “Our Father prayer.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> To teach in Jewish territory the minister knows he needs to be direct and pointed, and he may prepare his sermon from the Hebrew Scriptures. In so-called Intellectual areas, such as towns with colleges, the minister adapts to the students’ way of thinking. He takes an interest in each student he meets, as to where his home is and what course he is specializing in; then he adapts his sermon accordingly. In foreign-language-speaking territory, the minister has on hand foreign-language literature and makes use of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Preach the Word.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> In rural areas people may be inclined to discuss weather and crops briefly before getting down to the subject of the visit. The minister adapts to this situation. In a fishing village, the minister could include scriptures pertinent to fish, such as the prophecy of the fish that come to life in the healed waters of the Salt Sea. In territories with many victims of this world’s injustices, the minister may include scriptures describing their plight and that give them hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> No matter who comes to the door, the current sermon will benefit him. But on some occasions and in some territories we may do more effective teaching by altering the arrangement of our sermon or by substituting another. Observe local circumstances, the householder’s religion, age, health and special interests ; then adapt your sermon accordingly. This is in harmony with Paul’s counsel.—1 Cor. 9: 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organised Social Entertainment</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> From one locality it is reported that there is a regular arranging of social events, not at the Kingdom Hall where such sociabilities are prohibited, but in halls rented on the outside, and that to these events the brothers of not only one congregation but of others in the vicinity are invited. The motive for holding these parties is set forth as being to enable particularly the young folk of the congregations to get better acquainted with one another. In one district there seems to be a trend in this direction of holding large-scale social affairs, ostensibly to increase inter-congregational acquaintanceship and to enjoy together several hours of relaxation and and to do so in a safe way so that no worldliness or no worldly elements insinuate themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> The brothers responsible for such social gatherings on a large scale try to rationalize in behalf of the propriety of holding such social events. Some time ago it was even suggested to the Society that it ought to appoint in each congregation a servant of entertainment to arrange for and organize and supervise social engagements of this kind in the congregation, or in conjunction with other congregations. The Society then let it be known that it would not appoint any so-called servant of entertainment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The servants authorized by the Word of God are appointed to serve the spiritual needs of the brothers. The same is true of the congregation Kingdom Hall. The fact is that the purpose of the entire congregation organization is to upbuild the brothers spiritually and to aid them in accomplishing the serious, highly important work that Jehovah God has commissioned us to do. Giving attention to these spiritual matters, therefore, leaves little time available for the arranging and holding of social events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Also, if regular social events drag on through the night until after midnight and early into the morning of the next day the physical relaxation intended by these social events is counteracted by the fatigue the participants experience the succeeding day when they should be at their fittest to take care of their spiritual responsibilities in the field and at the service centers and at the Kingdom Hall. Social events easily open the way for love affairs and involve couples in difficulties. The wholesome atmosphere on these occasions, if held regularly, is liable to deteriorate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Worldly elements whose interest is mainly in having a good social time-with the opportunities that it affords for non-spiritual things are quite willing to attend such social functions, not primarily to get acquainted with spiritual people to be influenced spiritually. Such occasions are used by brothers to invite persons who can hardly be called reliable publishers, ostensibly, so to speak, to encourage them and to make them feel at home with the brothers, to show them that we are not strait-laced and do have good times among ourselves. It is reported that the participants in some cases not being satisfied with what is served inside the rented hall go to the outside for particular refreshments and that some begin to be careless about their conduct and language, mistakenly feeling that Christian relaxation allows for such.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Hence the Society feels obliged to repeat that it is not in favor of such a trend and refuses to recognize or co-operate with any such appointment of a servant of entertainment or master of ceremonies for social gatherings of such kind. The Day is drawing near. For this reason the apostle says we are all the more to gather together, not for mere social pleasures, but to consider one another from a spiritual standpoint and to incite one another, not to sexual love, but to love of God and of neighbor and to incite to right works in harmony with our Christian commission and to make public declaration of our hope without wavering in order that others may be strengthened in the enjoyment of the same faith and hope and may never waver. The place for thus gathering together all the more so because the day is drawing near is the Kingdom Hall, where all those attending service centers during the week may gather.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Also in the case of neighboring congregations, the place for the members thereof to get acquainted with the brothers in other congregations is at the circuit assemblies and the district assemblies. The purpose of such assemblies is not physical and mental relaxation. It is true that these assemblies enable us to get acquainted with many friends</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">we never knew before, but that is not the prime objective. The announced purpose strictly adhered to is to school ourselves for better performance of our ministry in the future. Such assembly gatherings are a safe and wholesome place for us to get acquainted with one another and to engage in exercises that are profitable and edifying, helping us to redeem the time and to walk wisely because we are in the midst of this world and the days are wicked ones. It is because such assemblies rest upon a theocratic basis rather than a social one that we are spiritually refreshed and renewed, and we are warned and safeguarded against the many dangers and wrong-tendencies rampant in this world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Overseers of congregations and their assistant servants are shepherds of the flock. They must pay attention to themselves and to the flock in a spiritual behalf. Consequently they will concentrate mainly upon providing for the spiritual needs of the congregation, attending to their assigned duties rather than diverting themselves to social affairs. The New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses is no social club.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Let us, then, live now for the new world in a way that befits those who are witnesses of the Most High God, Jehovah, and imitators of his Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>

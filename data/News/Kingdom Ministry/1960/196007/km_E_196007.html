<p><span class="font5">Assemble Still More as the Day Nears</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> At no time in history has it ever been more vital to assemble and to aid others to assemble with Jehovah’s people. Why? Because we behold “the day drawing near.” Not only will we assemble still more ourselves as the day nears, but we want to be zealous in encouraging persons conscious of their spiritual need to assemble with us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How can we aid righteously disposed persons to keep “close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah” and to assemble with the New World society? By giving them the enlightenment and encouragement that come from studying the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth’’!</span><span class="font9"> In view of both the imminence of Armageddon and the present East-West struggle, this book becomes more appropriate each day. This is the book to feature when presenting the offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> And there is more to the offer this month: Another bound book and two booklets. What other book should you use? Whichever book the congregation has a large supply of. Some congregations have a sizable supply of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand.”</span><span class="font9"> This is an apt companion volume to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth.”</span><span class="font9"> Since it is by means of the Kingdom that God’s will soon will be done on earth as it is in heaven, the volume ties in well with our sermon and the featured book. The Society has a supply of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;;</span><span class="font9"> congregations may order a supply of this book for use during the campaign. What if </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> householder already has one of the books in the offer you present? Be prepared to substitute another one by having on hand one or two different books. As one of the two booklets in the offer, include </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font9"> Use it to start a study on the initial placement or on the return call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Now is the time to review the fine sermon “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” To aid all publishers, study conductors should arrange for a different publisher each Sunday morning to demonstrate the sermon. Notify the publisher ahead of time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Pleasant weather is here, making it possible to enjoy a longer day in the field ministry. Throughout the summer arrange midweek contacts. Younger ministers, vacation pioneers and others will be able to go out during the week. If a dedicated brother is not available to take the contact, a sister may do so. While considering the text and comments and offering prayer, she will cover-her head.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> What territory should be worked? Work that which was not served much last year. Congregation servants and magazine-territory servants should go over the territories together; select those that have been | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR JULY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">least worked and concentrate on them. What if your congregation works territories every few weeks? Make the inspection anyway; nearly every congregation has territory that is not worked as often as others, perhaps territories that have not been worked within a year. Work these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Isolated Territory Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> In isolated territories the offer is different. Offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> and six booklets for $2. If the householder does not obtain this, offer any other of the Society’s publications that will help meet the individual’s spiritual needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Much isolated territory is still open for assignment. Some of it has not been worked for five years or more. Let the servants of each congregation discuss the matter; if the congregation can work some isolated territory, apply for it right away. Pioneers, vacation and regular, can apply for territory even if the congregation does not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Before going into isolated territory, know your objectives. Placing literature is but one goal. Another is to lay the groundwork for a congregation in the territory. Time is limited, so start organizing even before witnessing in the territory begins. How? Make preliminary surveys, determining where public meetings might best be held. Meetings may thus be held right from the beginning of the witnessing. When working the territory, you may wish to inquire at various homes where interest is shown if the householder knows of anyone willing to open his home for group Bible study in the area. If some in the territory start to publish, arrangements can be made with the Society for the circuit servant to visit this isolated group.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace-pursuing Assemblies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Many have already enjoyed the rich provisions of spiritual food that Jehovah provided at the June conventions in Fort Worth and Nashville. Most of us, however, are still looking forward to the abundance of good things to be served us at the Peace-pursuing District Assemblies. If you have not made your plans yet, do so immediately. Write the city of your choice for rooming accommodations. Spanish programs will be provided at the assemblies in Boston and Los Angeles, as at Fort Worth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Receiving so richly of our heavenly Father’s generosity, we will want to show generosity to others while at the convention city. How? Share in the field ministry scheduled for the first three mornings. Invite </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Assembling Still More as the Day Nears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Welcome, text, comments and talk on “Assembling Still More as the Day Nears.” (See “Watchtower,” July 1, I960, p. 414.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of the main article “Assemble Still More as the Day Nears.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Sermon Refresher on “Your Will Be Done on Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(13 min.) With sermon outlined on blackboard for all to see, chairman discusses with audience parts of the sermon and their transitions. Need for refresher as this sermon not used for several months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Your Will Be Done on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Taught to pray for God’s will to be done &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 6: 9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom will make possible doing God’s will on earth —Dan. 2: 44</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">When God’s will done, wars and hatred between men end—Isa. 2:4</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Earth to be filled with happy people doing God’s will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 65:21-23</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An introduction which might be used is: “My name is -----. I am calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to discuss briefly the solution to a major problem of our time, that of hate and bias among people. This is not only a national problem but one that is earth-wide. There are very little love and mutual understanding among people today. Do you feel it is God’s will for men to live in a condition of continued tension like this? [Allow householder to reply.] Likely you have prayed for an end to this situation as so many of us have by asking that God’s will be done on earth . . .” (See July, 1959, “Kingdom Ministry” for other introductions.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As two books will be offered, the conclusion should tie in with the book you will highlight. For example, with “Your Will Be Done on Earth” you might turn to the picture on page 341 and say: “In this publication it pictures beautifully how people will be able to live together in love and mutual understanding, all doing God’s will on earth. You will enjoy reading about this and the prophecies that prove this condition will come to pass on earth. This book and its companion, with these two booklets as a gift, are yours for only a $1 contribution.” (In “The Kingdom Is at Hand” see page 351, par. 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(6 min.) Publisher prepared in advance gives sermon, starts study in “Good News” booklet in conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Chairman discusses with audience good teaching methods employed by publisher giving sermon. Audience notes points that were applied, such as: Won interest of householder by introduction, drew householder into conversation, spoke in terms householder could understand, used illustrations, watched reaction of householder and was guided by it, showed enthusiasm, sincerity, tact, kindness, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman sums up, noting that all can use this sermon and employ good teaching methods if they prepare ahead of time. Urges regular use of sermons in the field service for most productive ministry. Also, have in mind starting studies on the initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Acts 2: 42, on page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 mtn: Still Time to Vacation Pioneer—talk and interview of those who are vacation pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Demonstration on . “Aiding New Ones to Appreciate Dedication and Baptism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) We want persons of good will to get life and we realize dedication is necessary for them. However, they may not see need even when they come to know this is the truth and want to be witnesses. Note how this family views their service to Jehovah: (Use same publisher and family as in previous months.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (3 min.) Family discuss blessings and joys they have had since learning truth. They consider it a real privilege to be Jehovah’s witnesses, are glad publisher showed them how to serve God. Conversation shows they think they are doing everything needed to please Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) They think they already do Jehovah’s will fully. We cannot tell them to dedicate their lives nor are we to persuade them to be baptized, but an effective teacher can help them understand the matter. With assembly approaching, publisher feels it is time they consider dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (4 min.) Study has concluded; family express appreciation for things learned. Publisher questions family, draws out their thoughts on how we can please Jehovah and whether Jehovah wants us to make a decision to serve him. Family had never thought of anything like that, want to know. Publisher suggests they study first nine paragraphs of “Dedication to God—the Way to Life” in the book “Let God Be True” for next week’s study. All are eager to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Publisher prepared additional information from “Make Sure of All Things” and issues of “The Watchtower” from recent years on dedication and baptism. Study on dedication, has concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (9 min.) Publisher discusses with family: (1) Dedication not joining a church, but entering special relationship with Jehovah to render exclusive devotion. (Ex. 20: 5) (2) Repentance, humility, change from any unclean ways of living must precede dedication. Conform to will of God. (3) Dedication brings responsibility. Once agreement made, faithfulness mandatory. (Ecci. 5: 4, 5) Serious, but joyful. Brings blessings now, places one on way to life. (Deut. 30: 19, 20) (4) Dedication should be symbolized by water baptism (immersion) as Jesus did and taught disciples. (Matt. 28: 19) Whether to make such dedication is for them to decide. Explains arrangements for baptism at coming assembly. Family express appreciation for information. Publisher counsels them to consider it prayerfully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After publisher leaves, family discuss their appreciation for things learned. Realizing dedication is essential step for them to take in the future, each will consider publisher's counsel carefully and prayerfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Publishers should be concerned with seeing persons they study with become dedicated, baptized, but do not push. Must be personal decision. At appropriate time, explain it so they know what it means, can make decision. Show full seriousness, but emphasize blessings, joys, rewards, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article on “Improving Service Meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on the need for a schedule to care for theocratic interests properly. Include “Yearbook” experiences: &nbsp;&nbsp;Publishers keep to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">preaching schedule despite heavy rain (106). Brother changes job so working schedule will allow attendance at meetings (270). Do you place same importance on theocratic activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Talk and demonstration on “Teach New Ones to Comment at Meetings.” To be conducted by “Watchtower” study servant or other capable brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Hosea 14: 2, AS, on page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” covering paragraphs 51 through 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: “Yearbook” experiences about serving where the need is great. Present with two publishers, one explaining to the other why he is going where the need is great, with references to “Yearbook” experiences as his reasons. Good-will persons are crying for help (84), remarkable response to preaching (132) and families often can accomplish more than individual pioneers or missionaries (212). Can you respond to the cry of Jehovah’s hungry sheep by serving where the need is great?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration of points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregations having a fifth service meeting will arrange their own program. The week after your congregation attends the district assembly the entire service meeting should be devoted to a discussion of convention experiences and things learned there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">those with whom you stay to assemble with the peace-pursuing New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> During the vacation months of July and August many publishers will be away from home. If you will be, keep a record of all witnessing done with the congregation in the vacation area. Mail your report to your congregation servant. Brothers on vacation always find great joy and satisfaction in assembling and working with the New World society wherever they are. Wherever you are this summer, be regular in the field ministry and in -assembling together—“and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near/’</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Service Meetings (Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> There is no successful shortcut to effective service meetings. Preparation is the key. Whether you are assigned to present a talk, a demonstration, a group discussion or a question-and-answer part, give it careful thought, with particular emphasis on effective teaching. In this article we are particularly interested in improving the effectiveness of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">question-and-answer parts</span><span class="font9"> on the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When you are assigned material to present at the service meeting, study it carefully, get it thoroughly in mind; then carefully prepare written questions. There are usually several important points in each paragraph that should be emphasized. To make these stand out, it is usually preferable to avoid compound questions. Rather, keeping in mind the time available, on each paragraph prepare several short questions that are right to the point. Some true-or-false questions may be used for variety.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Properly phrased questions will encourage pointed answers. Enthusiasm on your part is important. Do not pass over important points after just a simple comment that repeats what is in the paragraph. As time permits, encourage discussion of the material, so that all appreciate its importance and understand how to apply it. That is teaching. Your objective should be to have the audience do the talking.</span></p></li>

Then spend your time on the material in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> or other publication that you are assigned to handle. A few remarks to summarize the material, with motivation to action, will serve as a fitting conclusion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> To create further interest and enliven the discussion, the audience might occasionally be divided into two parts, with those on one side being asked a question, and if none can answer it, then those on the other side may be given a chance to answer it; alternate sides on the next question. This is not to be done in a competitive spirit, keeping score, but to create interest and to keep the discussion lively. Preparation before the meeting on the part of all publishers will do much to add life to the meeting and will ensure that the maximum good is derived from each part.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> It is not necessary to read all the paragraphs in summary. However, there may be certain ones that you will want to read because they are particularly important and the instruction in them should be made to stand out. In handling discussions of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity</span><span class="font9"> it is advisable to read each paragraph after it has been discussed.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach New Ones to Comment at Meetings</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> New ones should be helped to appreciate that their expression to others is a proof of their faith and leads to salvation. (Rom. 10:10) Point out to them that Jesus ‘declared God’s name in the midst of a congregation.’ (Heb. 2:12) Therefore, as Christians, it is their privilege to comment at meetings. It is a priceless privilege, for their expressions of faith are a real stimulus to older ones in the truth to continue in love and right works.—Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Knowledge, like faith, is useless without expression, so impress on new ones that study should be done with the purpose in mind of putting the knowledge to use, not only in the field ministry but also by commenting at meetings. The first step in teaching new ones to comment at meetings is to do so ourselves, for they will be like their teacher. —Luke 6: 40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Emphasize simplicity; an idea well understood can be expressed in few words and will be easier for the listener to understand. So teach new ones to analyze the question, help them locate the idea or thought in the paragraph that answers it, and then have them express that idea to you in their own words. Teach them to ascertain the relationship of scriptures in the paragraph to their answer. Have them mark key words in the margin or underline them in the paragraph, so as to bring the idea to mind at the time of the meeting. Encourage them to speak loud enough and slowly, so as to be understood by all in attendance. When they absorb the idea and can express it, you might say : “Now you have answered these questions here, why not plan to do this at the hall next Sunday?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> At the Kingdom Hall sit with the new one; your presence will be a source of strength. A good suggestion is to sit up close to the front, then there will not be the feeling that many eyes are watching. Perhaps the conductor can be asked in advance to look for his hand; that way he will not be overlooked. However, if newer ones do not volunteer by raising their hand they should not be called on, for we do not want to cause them embarrassment. A successful method of starting new ones to comment has been to assign them a scripture to read. After the meeting genuine expressions of appreciation for their comments will encourage them to continue. With every publisher sharing by commenting, the meetings will stimulate those present to love and right works.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">When Asked, “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In some areas people have been taught to ask, “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” and when answered, “Yes,” to close the door. You do not want to seem evasive or hesitant in acknowledging that you are. But you have only a few seconds to say something for the person to think about, or that may get his attention. Depending on the circumstances, you might use one of the following answers. Always remember, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">whatever you say must be with kindness and tact</span><span class="font9"> to help the person, not to be sarcastic, “smart” or to “get back” at him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In a “Christian” neighborhood you could answer, “That is what Jesus Christ was; so we follow his example,” or, “I would not use that name except that the Bible calls Jesus one of God’s witnesses.” If proof is needed, you can turn to Revelation 3:14 and John 18:37 or Hebrews 12:1, 2, with 1 Peter 2:21, showing the work we feel we are bound to do and then get into the sermon or show how the literature helps one to learn about Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In a Jewish neighborhood you might say: “The entire Jewish nation served Jehovah as his witnesses. I have that desire and am sure that you do also,” or, “God called Abraham, Moses and David his witnesses and, as a servant of God, I am also.” Isaiah 43:10-12 can be referred to.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font16">Still Tim© t© &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^i©gae®r</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> At times it is good to ask a question. You might say: “May I ask why you asked me that question?” (or, “May I ask why you thought I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses?”) Whatever the person answers, you can show that you have a Bible reason for bearing that name, for calling at his home, explaining why you called.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Some have met the situation by replying: “May I ask why it is that many people ask anyone with a Bible in his hand if he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses? Are they the only ones who come to talk to people about it?” This could be stated as though you wonder whether or not any other religions do such work. Then show the vital necessity of the Kingdom message and the warning being given. “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.”—Col. 4: 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark7"></a>NEW WORLD NEWS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">-^&gt;The branch office in Chile reports that many brothers lost their homes and household goods as a result of the earthquakes there. However, early reports showed that none of the brothers had been killed or seriously injured. Brothers in Chile are sending clothing to those in the disaster areas, and the Society is providing financial help to brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">^The branch servant in Poland has been imprisoned again by the Communist government, but the Polish brothers continue to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">e|&gt;The Cuban report is the best yet, with 12,745 publishers, a 14-percent increase, for April. By diligent effort with the special magazines one sister placed 3,002 copies during the month; another placed 823, while her circuit servant husband placed 745.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother N. H. Knorr left Brooklyn on June 10 for a service tour of European branches and conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Use the “Divine Wil!” Film</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many congregations that have had access to a copy of the Society’s film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses” have had amazing results in its use. One congregation servant reports that at their eight service centers they normally report 140 as total attendance, but the total for the film showings at these service centers was over 300! “It works wonders in building up the appreciation of persons of good will for the organization,” said another. “They are Impressed with the magnitude of the organization, the spirit of the brothers and their unity.” Others report similar results, with attendance at service centers usually running at least double when the film is shown after personal word-of-mouth invitations have been extended to those in the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No doubt many congregations will want to make use of the film during the months to come, at Kingdom Halls, service centers and in isolated territory. Especially will it supply a fine stimulus for persons of good will and new publishers. Congregations are invited to obtain their own copy of the film for use; circuits, branches and individuals may also order copies. The film is 16 mm, double-perforated, and silent; along with the narrator’s script in English or Spanish, it costs $200.00. Full remittance should accompany each order.</span></p>

<p><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup><a name="bookmark8"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> What a privilege it is to be a pioneer, enjoying the blessings of Jehovah’s service every day! Many who are not able to be in the regular pioneer ranks have found that vacation pioneer service has opened to them, even for a few weeks or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font9"> months each year, spiritual rewards that far exceeded their expectations.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup><a name="bookmark9"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> On concluding her annual period of vacation pioneering, one young publisher wrote: “I would like to send my thanks for making it possible for youths my age to spend their vacations in the pioneer service. The more time I spend in the service and the more study I do, the more sure I become that doing Jehovah’s will is my purpose in life.” Are you pioneering during your vacation this summer? There is still time to do it.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup><a name="bookmark10"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> Parents with young children</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><a name="bookmark11"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9">have also been able to organize their-affairs to spend three or four hours in the service each day, so meeting the pioneer requirements. “The past month of service to Jehovah, on the part of my wife and me as vacation pioneers has been a blessing and a joy. Even with three children, 3J, 5J, and 7 years respectively, we were able to plan and schedule our affairs to share in all phases of service. Together we placed 61 books, 390 magazines, made 108 back-calls and had the pleasure of starting 16 new Bible studies during the month.”</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup><a name="bookmark12"></a></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> Are your circumstances in any way similiar to those of these publishers who have found such rich blessings in the pioneer service? Is your desire to pioneer as strong as theirs? If so, prayerfully consider how you too can organize your affairs to share in this blessed service.</span></p>

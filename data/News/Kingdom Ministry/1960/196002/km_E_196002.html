<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It is only by spiritual activity that one can prove oneself to be a Christian soldier that is contending “for victory in the right contest of the faith.” That is how to experience the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise that he will be “as mightiness to those turning away the battle from the gate.” The promise is fulfilled toward those that are pushing the battle, not to those that are inactive. In view of this you will not let the generally bad weather of February stop your soldierly activities and cause you to become inactive. With Jehovah’s mightiness, push on despite the weather. If you live in a cold section of the country, try alternating your house-to-house work with back-calls. They will give you a chance to warm up.—1 Tim. 6:12; Isa. 28:5, 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Although the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription offer is being stressed, any who want to present subscriptions for both magazines for two dollars, with a gift of six booklets, may do so. Many pioneers have had good results by making this offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Look for opportunities to present </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> People should have it. They need it. A pioneer that obtained 120 subscriptions during the last </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign believes that the following things she did contributed to her success: (1) Regular participation in house-to-house work and all other Kingdom activities. (2) Calling back on all subscription promises. (3) Not neglecting expired subscriptions. (4) Encouraging people she studied with to subscribe. (5) Making the offer in telephone conversations, when writing letters, and in other incidental witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Often people that speak a foreign language are happy to get something in their own tongue. Offer them a subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> in it. A circuit servant writes that he did this when a lady that spoke Croatian and who understood very little English was contacted at a door. “Knowing that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> is published monthly in Croatian,” he says, “I offered her </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> subscription for it. She was excited to think she could get something to read in her own language and readily accepted the offer.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Since ministerial activity is essential for Jehovah to become “as a crown of decoration and as a garland of beauty” to a person, servants in the congregation will be alert to help publishers that fail to report. They will also see that new publishers that began since December are given special help. They can encourage sick publishers to be spiritually active by writing letters, &nbsp;using &nbsp;the &nbsp;telephone, &nbsp;if</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Are you looking forward to April ? Every </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">congregation</span><span class="font12"> and Kingdom publisher should be—not only with anticipation, but also by planning and making advance preparations. What is to be special about April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> First, there is the special public talk, “Universal Disarmament by</span></p></li></ul>

This talk will appear in the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> and each congregation will receive an advance issue for use by the speaker only. Handbills for the talk should be ordered at once.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Second, there is the special weekend of activity centering on the Memorial celebration. Speakers remind the publishers to commence now to prepare persons they study with for service. Perhaps such ones will be able to begin publishing by April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The new back-call sermon is not only easy to use but has proved an excellent means for starting Bible studies. Make definite arrangements for back-calls and then use it with enthusiasm. Booklets are offered with the subscription, and the starting of home Bible studies is not difficult when you use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am, Making All Things New.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> February is a short month, but one that we should fill with theocratic activity. Prove by such activity that you are a Christian soldier that acquires strength from Jehovah for spiritual warfare.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">should be assigned now and prepare well. Saturday, April 9, will be a big day of service with magazines, culminating with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study that would normally be held on April 10. Sunday will be a day of service, and a special effort will be made to visit people of good will and bring them </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font12"> Memorial with us. Since the Memorial comes on a Sunday, we ought to have the greatest attendances ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Memorial Invitations</span><span class="font12"> will be printed by the Society. They will be handbill size on special white paper. All subscribers in your territory and all persons of good will should receive an invitation delivered in person or by mail. These invitations will not be distributed on the streets as handbills are.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Acquiring Mightiness for Turning the Battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on theme for the month, “Acquiring Mightiness for Turning the Battle.’’ (See “Watchtower,” March 1, 1959, pp. 148, 149, and February 1, 1960, p. 87.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Acquire Mightiness for Turning the Battle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Demonstrate and analyze back-call sermon. One week in advance remind publishers to have “Good News” booklet and Bible with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) Purpose of back-call sermon is to start studies. New sermon gives scripture and page in booklet where it is found so portion of back-call discussion can be conducted right out of the booklet. You may want to use only the Bible for the first scripture or two, or you may start right away with the booklet. Pick out points in paragraph dealing with scripture, and show how questions direct attention to these points. Read or refer to points in booklet and have householder follow. (It is not always necessary to read whole paragraph, but it would be good to read paragraph 45.) Let householder read Bible texts quoted in paragraph in his own Bible or from yours. It is an excellent way to start studies. Any who have held back from using former back-call sermons need only try using this one to find the ease and pleasure of it. Mark points for discussion in margin of study copy of booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Urge all to follow in their own booklets and Bibles as sermon is demonstrated and to make note of good points. After sermon, publishers will be asked to analyze it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(15 min.) Demonstration of sermon. (Chairman may have sermon outline on platform.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: The Answer to the Lord’s Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Suggested introduction: “Since my last visit I have been very eager to return and talk with you further on prayer. Previously we considered the value and need of prayers and learned what prayers God hears. Now I would like to share with you the assurance that God will hear these prayers, and show what the answer to our prayers will bring. May I step in so we can consider this? [If not invited in, continue at door.] In my study of the Word of God, I have learned that in prayer it is our privilege to thank God for the many blessings of each day, for all of the kindnesses that he grants us, and to petition him for additional blessings according to his will. You will recall we discussed Jesus’ instructions for prayer, and the booklet I left considers that very point.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Taught to pray for Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">gn par. 9 (Matt. 6: 9, 10) Kingdom will destroy wicked rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">gn par. 40 (Rev. 16: 14-16) Peace, security will result</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">gn par. 42 (Mic. 4: 3, 4 and/or Isa.11: 6-9) Blessings enjoyed forever under</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom gn par. 43 (Ps. 72: 1-5) To receive benefits of Kingdom prayed for, must gain knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">gn par. 45 (Rom. 10: 17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In conclusion, review the points learned, and make definite arrangements to return to further discuss points such as the value of the Bible, the true God, Jesus Christ, the reason why God permits suffering, and how we can gain life in his new world (some of which are referred to in paragraph 45).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(7 min.) Chairman will conduct analysis of sermon. Ask audience to comment on how the call was handled and why the things done were effective. Thoroughly analyze the introduction, the way in which the booklet was used, use of the Bible, concluding review, and the way interest was aroused and arrangements were made for the next call. Draw attention to application of the principles of teaching discussed in previous issues of “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman urges all to use this simple but effective sermon to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Ps. 91:2] at bottom of page 1, and remarks on the article “238,879 Publish in December.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Read January 15 pioneer letter and talk on material in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include “Yearbook” experience from Labrador, on page 222.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17 min: “Be a Teacher in Public Speaking.” Talk by school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 min: Back-Calls Result in Bible Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Give up-to-date count on subscriptions placed. What are we doing for these people now? We are interested in lives. Need to lead sheep to flock of God. Recall demonstration last month on presenting subscription, various attitudes of family. Let us see what has been done for this family. (Use same group, if possible.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(17 min.) Household scene. Wife reading “The Watchtower,” husband newspaper, daughter busy with schoolwork. Wife comments on point in “Watchtower.” Husband remarks on her interest in it, wonders why it has affected her so. Wife explains how much she is learning about Bible, hope for future. Daughter remarks Bible isn’t that interesting to her. Husband is concerned with problems of today, making a living. He is glad wife enjoys it, maybe some day he will get to look into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publisher calls. After introduction regarding his calling with more information on prayer, wife welcomes him in. Husband says, “Hello,” and continues reading paper. As publisher starts sermon, he invites husband to note these things in his Bible too. Husband does not feel he is interested, but wife can go ahead. Publisher comments that husband is interested in family, good provider, may feel this keeps him so busy he has no time to concern self with Bible now. Publisher asks if he ever feels need for divine guidance in caring for family, when problems arise, etc. Husband acknowledges he does. Publisher proceeds tactfully to show that father is spiritual provider, needs to lead family in spiritual life, can give strength to family if he has knowledge of Bible, knows how to pray. We must know how to pray to be heard by God. Daughter’s attention has been gained, publisher turns to her, asks what she would think necessary to be heard by God. Follows with question on to whom prayer should be addressed. Daughter asks: “Jesus?” Publisher asks her to come and see what Bible says, while mother and father follow in family Bible. Gives sermon, using “Good News” booklet, in entirety. Publisher is warm and friendly, keeps whole family involved in discussion. Definite arrangements made to continue following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publisher gone, family comments on points learned. Father sees he does need to consider Bible. Daughter had no idea Bible was that interesting. Mother reflects they never learned that much in church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman (3 min.) Alert publisher has taken family another step to life. Husband’s objection was standard excuse. By answering objection his interest was aroused. Now publisher has study started with whole family. Note “Yearbook,” top of page 143. Neglect no one. Make return calls and start home. Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on district assembly announcement in “Watchtower,” February 1, 1960.)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Like a wide door, the pioneer service stands open to all publishers. Some, after carefully adjusting their affairs, readily enter and daily delight in the blessings that come as the result. But encouragement is often needed for others to take the step across the threshold into the pioneer ministry. The overseer and his assistants have many opportunities to show how the pioneer service is within reach of many more publishers. Also, those already pioneering, by their example and encouragement, can do much to aid still others to join them in these special privileges, as can circuit and district servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Continuing each month through May, the Society will be sending a special letter to each congregation, extending an invitation to as many publishers as can to become pioneers. These will be read and discussed in the service meeting by competent brothers. Perhaps the consideration of the letters will open up ways for some to pioneer or to see how they can plan for it. In reading and discussing these letters the attitude of the speaker toward pioneering will mean much. Is he convinced that more could be pioneers? Has he thought out prac-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">need. No speaker’s name will appear. You may order 250 for ten cents or 500 for fifteen cents, if you do not need a thousand. For a thousand or more the normal handbill rate applies. If you will order the invitations at the same time as you order<sup>-</sup> handbills for the April 3 special public talk, it will save on shipping costs. Order as soon as possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> April will also be a special magazine month. Both the April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and the April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will be special issues, easy to place and containing important information. To help us make April the best yet, congregation publishers will strive to meet a quota of one a day, or thirty for the month; pioneers, four a day, or a total of 120; special pioneers, six a day, or 180 for the month. Place your orders for additional magazines as soon as possible, as these should all be in by March 1. Begin planning how you can place your quota.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> And finally, April is to be a special month by reason of the 20-percent increase we will be striving for—265,488 publishers. Can we make it? With Jehovah’s blessing</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">tical ways to enhance the points made in the letter?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The general attitude of the congregation toward the pioneer service is often a reflection of the attitude of the congregation servant and his assistants toward pioneering. If they recommend it enthusiastically, and consider it for themselves, if their personal affairs will allow for this, the congregation is inclined to adopt the same attitude. As for the servants and study conductors who find that they cannot be regular pioneers themselves, it is hoped that many can be vacation pioneers sometime during the course of a year. The best way to recommend the pioneer service is to enjoy it yourself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> For those who enter the open door of pioneer service, there are even greater privileges to strive for. One in the pioneer service who is free to serve wherever he is needed can and should reach out for special pioneer service, missionary service, circuit servant work, or Bethel service. All should endeavor to improve the effectiveness of their ministry. The progressive overseer will encourage the pioneers associated to make advancement in this way. Taking an assignment to serve where the need is great may be the first step toward greater privileges in the New World society.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher in Public Speaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As a public speaker, do </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font12">than talk to your audience—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">teach! </span><span class="font12">Do not be satisfied that they </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font12">heard; help them to understand. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font12">is often insufficient simply </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">to state </span><span class="font12">an important point. Take time to explain it. So, too, with scriptures, more than reading may be needed. Explain them; make clear their relation to the subject; draw attention to the various phrases in the text that pinpoint the idea. Help your audience to see the subject just as clearly as you do.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Your own attitude directly affects your ability as a public teacher. You must realize that it is more than just an assignment to give a talk. Study your- subject until you see clearly why your audience needs to hear the material you plan to present. If you cannot find enough of a reason to make you sincerely enthusiastic about it, then speak to others about it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Prepare your talk with teaching in mind. Think out appropriate illustrations to clarify your arguments, to help your audience see tlie reasonableness of the truth in the light of their everyday experiences, to appreciate their need to apply the counsel given. Plan how you will develop your material and how you will tie it in with the theme so the talk will be coherent, the presentation logical, and the arguments easy to understand. Before you get up to speak, it would be well to state concisely to yourself the key points you want the audience to learn. If you can do it before your talk, and present the talk with those points in mind, many who hear you will also have them in mind when you finish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Employ a teaching style of delivery. An effective teacher must be interested in his students. You can show that interest by your enthusiasm, your warmth, your kindness, sincerity and conversational delivery. Speak from the heart, and you will reach the heart of your hearers. To drive home important arguments you may want to encourage the audience to look up certain scriptures with you, giving them time to do so. Just as a house-to-house teacher must not present his sermon so rapidly that the householder does not get full benefit from it, so a public speaker must regulate his pace of delivery according to the ability of the audience to grasp what is presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To be a teacher in public speaking, think in terms of teaching and pray for Jehovah’s guidance.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The sermon on prayer should awaken real hope in the hearer, also faith that he can have his prayers answered. Do not break this train of thought upon completing your sermon, but use a good transition to show him that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">will give him the help needed to lead him right into the realization of these good things.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> With the use of the February 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> you may say, after reading Revelation 21: 3, 4 : “These desirable conditions will be brought by the Kingdom we pray for. Note this comment here in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> [Call attention to page 100, the last paragraph in the article, and comment.] You will want to read this article, as well as the one here on ‘Safeguard Your Thinking Ability.’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoioer </span><span class="font12">is published twice a month. For a contribution of one dollar you can have it come to you regularly for a year, until next March, getting the excellent help it offers to guide our lives in God’s ways with the hope of living in such a righteous new world.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Another transition, after commenting on Revelation 21:3, 4, might be: “God is also very kind in being conscious of even our personal or family problems. He wants us to</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost,” said the man of Jesus’ illustration concerning the one lost sheep. The man was rewarded for his effort. A life was saved. So he called out to his neighbors and friends to rejoice with him. Jesus said there was even great rejoicing in heaven among the holy angels of God over the repentance of one sinner. With this thought in mind let us rejoice as we see the gratifying results shown in December’s report.—Luke 15 : 4-7.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In 1959, there were, on an average, 221,240 publishers in the United States that worked hard searching for sheeplike persons lost in the wilderness of the world. They combed the territories in the house-pray and seek the counsel of his Word so that these problems may be solved in the right way. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> is published to help persons who desire to get this valuable counsel. Here on the third page of this issue a problem that nearly every community has is discussed and the sure remedy shown. [Comment on a point or two in the article.] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoioer,</span><span class="font12"> coming to your home twice a month, will enable you to approach daily problems and to get the help that prayer gives in solving them. A contribution of only one dollar will bring </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to you twice a month for an entire year.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> For a more general transition you could say: “The Kingdom that we pray for- will bring this wonderful condition to earth. As the front cover shows, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoioer</span><span class="font12"> is wholly devoted to announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. Like a person on a high tower you can see with understanding from God’s Word present developments that are bringing us nearer to the Kingdom’s blessing of all mankind.”</span></p>

This represents, not one, but 17,639 more persons declaring themselves for Jehovah than last year’s average. This is an 8-percent increase, truly a cause for rejoicing! Now let us watch over these.

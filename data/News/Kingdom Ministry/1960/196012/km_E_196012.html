<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">DECEMBER, 1960 “Seek peace and pursue it. For Jehovah’s eyes are upon the righteous.”—1 Pet. 3:11,12. VOL. Ill NO. 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pursue Peace in the Love of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> We want other people to enjoy life in God’s new world; so as Christians we pursue peace in a most positive way. How? By “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” With our 10-percent increase in view, December is the month to put forth extra efforts as we “pursue peace with all people.”—1 Cor. 15: 58; Heb. 12:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> What a tremendous help is this month’s offer in aiding new ones to pursue peace with God I Both books are easy to place and so appropriate for starting studies. Here is a letter from a fourteen-year-old boy: “I was baptized Catholic, but for a long time I did not believe what my church taught. I read your book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font8"> and have found what I have been searching for. Please tell me where meetings are held -where I live.” How urgent the need to follow up all placements! If we really ‘do our utmost to present ourselves approved to God,’ a Bible study can be arranged. “I’ve been in the truth several years now,” writes one publisher, “and even though having much encouragement to share in Bible study work, failed to do so until recently. After hearing so many fine experiences of different publishers starting studies when placing literature, I decided to try it and am now happy to say—I have my first Bible study. Wish I had tried the suggestion sooner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reaching the 10-Percent Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Our goal for December is a 10-percent increase, or 255,895 publishers. What can we do to work toward this goal? Let every publisher try to be out in the field ministry by December 4. Those not out by then should be given kind encouragement, as the assistant congregation servant gives a list to all study conductors each week thereafter of ones who have not reported. Study conductors will make definite arrangements to assist all in their</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">service centers. Publishers not reporting by December 20 should be assisted by the congregation servant or assistant congregation servant. The overseer’s having a meeting with all servants and study conductors the last few days of November will help to get December off to a fine start. Let each congregation’s aim be “100 percent reporting.”</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What Has Happened to 409,531 Hours?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Life is a gift from God. Who is there in his right mind that would spurn this gift? With life we praise God and derive exhilarating pleasure and excitement. “The dead themselves do not praise Jah, nor do any going down into silence,” wrote the psalmist. To gain the gift of everlasting life we must praise God, and we will want to do this if we are conscious of our spiritual needs and privileges.—Ps. 115:17.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Last year there was a 409,531 drop in witnessing hours, which is</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR DECEMBER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4 Pursuing Peace in the love of Life. 4 &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—1 Pet. 3:10, 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">a cause for concern. When we consider that Jehovah blessed our ministry with 11,000 new publishers in the United States, this decrease in hours becomes magnified even more, because we naturally expect the increase to bring the total hours up. The congregation publishers for the first time in five years dropped, on the average, below ten hours monthly. The national monthly average per publisher is about a half hour less than a year ago. In 1959 the total hours were 36,890,221, or an average of 10.4 per publisher, where-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> To reach the goal we will need to help persons with whom we are already studying to pursue peace. Invite them to preach. Pay close attention to the suggestions for doing this when the service meeting part entitled “Help All to Preach in December” is considered. Take notes. Apply the information. Be expansion-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">as the 1960 total was 36,480,690, or an average of 9.9 per publisher. The pioneers also have dropped from last year’s average of 93.1 to 91 hours this year, which is the lowest pioneer average in ten years! The special pioneers have moved up slightly, to average 142.7 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> What has happened, brothers? This loss is serious. It may very well represent lives lost. What can we do to retard this downward trend? A solemn responsibility rests upon us to bear witness, not merely once in a while, but constantly, as persons who are “keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” As Paul said: “Necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news !”•—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font8"> Pet. 3:12; 1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> First, by servants and study conductors setting the right example in field service activity, the congregation will follow. Servants’ field service averages should always be an example for the congregation publishers. Congregation publishers will want to maintain at least the average of 10 hours a month, pioneers 100 and special pioneers 150, and with proper example and encouragement they will. They are anxious to guard this beautiful trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Second, the activities at the service centers should be looked into with the objective of cultivating a love and a warm enthusiasm for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Pursuing Peace in the Love of Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Talk on “Pursuing Peace in the Love of Life.’’ (See “Watchtower,” December 15, 1959, pp. 741-755, and December 1, 1960, p. 733.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article “Pursue Peace in the Love of Life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">23 min: “Help All to Preach in December.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Overseer acting as chairman, talks on importance of zealous share in ministry, so honoring Jehovah and saving ourselves and those who listen to us. If we do this regularly, it is only reasonable to see increase, and our goal for December is 10 percent. He expresses conviction goal will be reached locally. Special effort stimulates all of Jehovah's people. It builds faith, strengthens integrity and enlarges appreciation for service. During December strong, mature publishers put forth even greater effort through helping others; publishers usually putting in only a few hours are activated to put in more time; irregular ones are reacquainted with joys of the ministry and many new ones have their first taste of preaching the Kingdom good news. What practical means will be arranged for all to share in reaching the 10-percent goal in December?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(8 min.) Assistant congregation servant first outlines the potential congregation has for meeting 10-percent goal. Reveals number of Publisher’s cards in the file. Zealousness on the part of all of these required if goal to be met. Each week he will give lists of publishers not out in field service to study conductors. They will follow through by themselves aiding some of these to share in the field service and by assigning mature publishers to assist others. Next he discusses with audience what they can individually do to share in the field service and help others. They variously express themselves on supporting meetings for field service, adjusting their personal schedule to include more time for field service, gladly assisting others as assigned, etc. Some with health problems can use telephone, write letters, oi’ spend few minutes each week in regular feature of service, so accumulating hours of service. Every publisher can be active in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(9 min.) Bible study servant discusses with audience the need of helping persons with whom they are studying to appreciate the privilege and urgency of sharing in the field service. He will assist by calling on all publishers who have been conducting a study for at least six months and check with them on the possibility of aiding some of these students to go in the field service in December. (In larger congregations study conductors can share in contacting publishers who have had studies six months or more.) What will publishers do to help new ones? Audience responds with suggestions: Be service-minded; the more service-minded one is, the sooner the student will be ready to share in the field service. Make definite arrangements for new ones to go with you. Help them prepare what they will say, such as giving a magazine presentation or reading a scripture in the sermon as you give it at the door. Aid them to prepare a complete sermon; the better prepared they are the sooner they will share in teaching others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bible study servant invites all to come to him for help in starting new ones in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Overseer concludes with rousing talk outlining program to be followed and showing the great joy to be had by all in fully participating in tremendous December effort for 10-percent goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on “October Report” and slogan on bottom of page 1, based on 1 Thess. 5: 15.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER 5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “What Has Happened to 409,531 Hours?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">28 min: Helping Those Who Already Have the Literature Offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Millions of persons have copies of the “Paradise” book, “Let God Be True” or other Society books, but only a small portion of these have studies in their homes. Many of them have shown a receptive heart condition, but not all are being cared for. We locate many of these as we go from door to door and find people who say: ‘I already have that book.’ Will we give them the help they need or will we be like this publisher?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (3 min.) Publisher giving sermon takes out “Paradise” book after Gen. 1: 28 as suggested. Householder states he already has it. Publisher is pleased to learn that, asks if he has been able to read it, and how it was enjoyed. On hearing householder’s reply that not much has been read, publisher encourages him to read it regularly so as to benefit from its wonderful material, then offers “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” which householder also has. Publisher encourages him to be sure to study them to gam valuable information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Calls for audience comments on how effective that was and what could be done. Bring out: If you find someone who has the literature, the interest should be cultivated as diligently as if you placed the literature personally, unless another publisher is currently doing this adequately. Do not neglect caring for persons like this; take positive approach. How can such householders be helped?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (5 min.) Same publisher giving sermon takes out “Paradise” book as in Scene I. On being advised householder has it, publisher </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font7">pleased to know it, inquires as to how much householder has learned about paradise. Do you think God still purposes that there be a paradise? If so, where? Householder is not clear on the matter, so publisher gives sermon and then endeavors to start the study as outlined in June, 1960, “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Benefits and values pointed out. Someone in audience asks how publisher would handle this call if householder knew about paradise being restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (10 min.) Same publisher giving sermon takes out book as in Scene I. On learning householder understands paradise is to be restored to earth, publisher uses Matt. 6:9, 10 to establish that Kingdom we pray for will restore the looked-for paradise. It will end all wickedness, as Ps. 37:10, 11 tells us. Turn to Ps. 37:10, 11 in Bible, then to page 222, par. 11, of “Paradise.” After discussing it, publisher comments how book will help one learn more of paradise being restored and how we can live there. Publisher asks to step in to show householder how book can be effectively used in study of Bible. Householder accepts. Publisher steps in, asks householder to get his copy of “Paradise” and Bible, completes back-call sermon (November “Kingdom Ministry”) and starts study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Be always ready to help sheeplike persons where -ever they are found. On initially placing literature the interest should be cared for to help people grow in knowledge. On encountering those who have been neglected, apply these practical suggestions so studies can be held with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan at bottom of page 4, based on Col. 1: 29.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">10 min: Report from magazine-territory servant, giving suggestions regarding territory coverage and how to increase magazine placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk on blessings from sharing in holiday magazine work. Include local experiences and “Yearbook” experiences. (Pp. 119, 133, 236) Also, demonstration of Presenting the Good News article on “What to Say in the Holiday Season.” (See also “Why Do They Celebrate December 25?” and the main article in “Watchtower,” December 15, 1960.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Read pioneer letter (11/20/60) and have a talk on it, preferably by a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include “A Good Report from Alaska.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” pars. 101-110. (If time does not allow, paragraphs need not be read in summary.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Preparation Essential in Theocratic Ministry School. School servant discusses preparation with several students who ask questions on various points of Congregation Organization article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">18 min: “Be a Teacher of Children —To Study.” Talk, together with audience discussion of article.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation Essential in Theocratic Ministry School</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Study and preparation are essential to benefit most from attendance at any school. How much more so the theocratic ministry school, which is providing vital training in the ministry. The school servant must prepare, the speakers must prepare, and all who attend must prepare. This will make the school interesting and instructive for all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> The school servant should prepare the schedules sufficiently in advance and be well acquainted with material on which the talks will be based. He should have appropriate opening and closing comments for the school. He can prepare to counsel by considering beforehand the needs of each student who will be speaking.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> October was a very fine month for Kingdom service. During it 240,578 In the United States reported, some seven thousand above the previous month and a 5.9-percent increase over last October. Throughout the country the brothers put their hearts into the work, and as a result 4,973,374 magazines were placed, which makes it one of the best reports for any one month to date! Each group of publishers did well: congregation publishers averaged 16.5, vacation pioneers 108.9, regular pioneers 136.9 and special pioneers 181.7. Total subscriptions obtained were 151,180.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Literally hundreds of telegrams, special delivery letters and phone calls were received asking for additional magazines. One congregation servant in Mississippi wrote: “This is the best special magazine campaign for us yet. Four pioneers and six congregation publishers placed 740 magazines in just three days. We need more!” For more such reports see </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> November 22, 1960, page 19.</span></p></li>

On occasion, the brothers may enjoy meeting together at the Kingdom Hall as a group to go witnessing from there. A special program can be prepared for the occasion.

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Be a Teacher of Children—To Study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> To be teachers of their children, parents must sincerely desire to obey Jehovah’s command: “Train up a boy according to the way for him.” (Prov. 22:6) From infancy the child should hear the discussion of the day’s text and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> comments. From infancy the child should be able to observe his parents’ example of showing diligence, enthusiasm and joy in study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Parents with young children could read them the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> book. Progress on to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.” </span><span class="font8">When they are old enough to read and look up scriptures, a regular established study in these books will ground them in doctrinal truths and proper moral conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Hold to a planned schedule of study. Teach children that, though there is a time for play, there is also a time for study. Make a schedule with reasonable study periods. Stick to the schedule as much as possible. Monday nights might be set aside for family study, as is done at Brooklyn Bethel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Open study periods with prayer so children appreciate they are being taught by Jehovah. Make study periods interesting. Explain difficult portions, using illustrations and rephrasing questions. Teach them the mechanics of study: how to underline, pick out key words, etc. Every child who is old enough to read should have his own textbooks and Bible. Teach the child how to locate scriptures. Have him learn the order of the books of the Bible, perhaps simplifying this by dividing the Bible into several sections.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Children should also be encouraged to do private study. The schedule of study could include reading the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> preparation of the lesson for the congregation book study and the ministry school. Make written reviews something children look forward to.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The congregation can help in teaching young ones to study by encouraging their comments at the congregation book study and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study. Do not forget children whose parents are not in the truth. Congregation servants could select a qualified brother who has children giving evidence of being well trained and ask if the brother would like to help the child. The child might be invited to the home of the theocratic family when they have their family study. Be a teacher of children, and ‘from infancy they will know the holy writings which are able to make them</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">‘ wise for salvation.’—2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The brother who gives the instruction talk should do more in preparation than getting the high points in mind from reading the lesson on which his talk is based and giving a general talk on these. He should study out the material so as to get across the principles and ideas with understanding. He should outline his talk and speak extemporaneously, working in good illustrations and pointed scriptures as time permits. Lack of preparation will often show up in his going overtime or presenting mere general points on the material. The school servant should be sure to give private counsel to the brother who gives the instruction talk, and this is best given right after the meeting. Other features of the school will be treated in later issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say in the Holiday Season</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> During this time of the year the people become filled with a manufactured spirit of happiness induced by commercial interests. On the other hand, their minds are often turned to the King, if only as an infant. As we preach the good news to them we should be cognizant of theii<sup>-</sup> frame of mind and use the occasion to turn their thoughts tactfully to the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> One might say: “Much is being said these days about peace on earth and good will to men, yet it seems that there is very little real peace and not much good will expressed between men or among nations. Have you ever wondered if it is really God’s purpose for men to live under conditions like these?” (Await their reply and then lead into the current sermon.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> On another occasion while working with the regular offer you might say: “In a world filled with distrust and hatred among men most people take much pleasure in the interlude of peacefulness that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pursue Peace in Love of Life </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font8">minded. Do not withhold an invitation when it is due. Avoid unnecessary delay. Benefit from this experience sent the Society: A family had been studying about three years. Whenever the study conductor asked about this family, he received the impression that there was not much interest. The study conductor and his wife visited the family. The result? “We found them eager to talk about the Bible and we invited them to go with us in the service. They said they would love to. I asked the wife when she came to the realization she wanted to share in the ministry. She looked at me and said that she wanted desperately to go in this work for two years I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Persons with whom studies are being conducted are often anxiously awaiting the opportunity of starting. Help them. Bible study servants will assist service centers this month as outlined in “Your Service Meetings.” They will supply study conductors with a list of persons who are studyseems to come at this time of the year. One hears much talk about the Prince of Peace and his birth. I am sure you have hoped that such peace might be permanent, have you not? [Let them comment.] You will be interested in knowing that a real condition of everlasting peacefulness is promised in the Bible. It comes under the reign of the Prince of Peace as the King of God’s kingdom. We have been instructed to pray for that time at Matthew 6:9, 10 . . . ’’(Then use the sermon “Your Will Be Done on Earth” in July </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Or, when working with the magazines, you might say : “Most people I have spoken to today have been in a very happy frame of mind as they contemplate the festivities to come. While there is much happiness, it is also a time to consider seriously the reason for the holiday. I am sure you will want to learn how the celebration on December 25 has developed. You can by reading this article, ‘Why Do They Celebrate December 25?’ in the latest issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.” </span><span class="font8">ing with publishers in their service centers, along with the number of months they have been studying. Study conductors will check with the publishers as to whether new ones have been invited and will render whatever aid may be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Special Magazine Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> December 24 is a good day for magazine work; and since Monday, December 26, will be a holiday for many persons, this should also be set aside for magazine work. The cold weather in many parts of the country need not stop us. In very cold weather some publishers work for an hour and then make back-calls. One older publisher with limited physical strength spends fifteen minutes in the ministry as many days as possible each month and continues to be regular. As we push toward the 10-percent increase, there is “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” May the results of our pursuing peace in the love of life go to Jehovah’s glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">From the 1961 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> it is very gratifying to note the progress made in the state of Alaska, which reports separately to the United States branch. Whereas the United States increased 5 percent in average publishers, Alaska enjoyed a 19-percent increase for the year on the average. During May there was a peak of 312 publishers. The 1959 peak was 271. In this land with the short summers and long, hard winters, each publisher on the average has been able to devote 11.0 hours to the service every month, compared with 9.9 in the lower 48 states. There were other good increases too. Magazines increased from 10.3 to 11.8; back-calls from 3.3 to 3.8 and Bible studies have held up to .7, with September’s report showing .8 per publisher. A fine report for the year 1 Publishers native to Alaska and those who moved there to serve where the need is great have been richly blessed during the year, and we rejoice with them.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Accurate knowledge means light and life. Its Source is Jehovah. Its purpose is that you may “walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work.” Ours is not only to preach and teach Christianity, but also to live it and to teach others how “to observe all the things” Jesus commanded. Therefore, to promote accurate knowledge both in ourselves and others is our duty and privilege as ministers of God.—Col. 1:9, 10; Matt. 28: 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Start New Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Because of the splendid and effective work of ministering accomplished in April, we have much to do in May. No doubt millions have read the special issues of the magazines with great interest. We must not neglect these, but follow up each placement with the thought that here may be one of Jehovah’s sheep. By showing them key points in the magazines they already have, we may be aide to arouse further interest and start studies with many of them. Let us help them to acquire accurate knowledge.—Prov. 18:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Thousands of new ones also assembled with us for the Memorial and the special public talk. By their presence they have manifested an interest that should by all means be followed up. A study should be arranged with them in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font14">book, if possible. Teach these new ones how to receive Jehovah’s sayings and observe them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Tens of thousands of persons have become new subscribers for </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> in recent months. Every one of these should be called on with a view to starting a study. On your initial call stress the joys of learning the truth. Do not underestimate the power of friendliness. It may not be possible to start a study on the first call, but it may be after several friendly calls. Work toward that end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">A New Sermon</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We have a new sermon with which to promote accurate knowledge this month. Its theme: “God’s Purpose for Man.” A slight change in presentation is suggested therewith. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font14"> book may be brought out and placed in the householder’s hand early in the sermon instead of holding it until the end. Brothers who have been assigned to try the new sermon and new method of presenting the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font14"> book report excellent results. Give the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MAY “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained” and one booklet, for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR MAY Promoting Accurate Knowledge in Ministers.—Coi. 1:9, 10.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace-pws&amp;aingi Assemblies in 1960</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Peace-pursuing Christians are looking forward to attending one of the district assemblies scheduled during June, July and August. Where will you attend? Make your plans now. While in most cases publishers will attend the convention nearest to them, they are at liberty to attend any city of theii- choice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Attached to each Room Request form are instructions that should be given careful consideration in a service meeting about six weeks prior to your assembly. Please do not send these forms to the Society. Send them to the convention headquarters in the assembly city, doing this no earlier than six weeks prior to the assembly. Addresses and assembly dates are listed on the back of each form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Volunteer Service forms should be filled in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">completely</span><span class="font14"> and returned to your congregation servant, who will sign and forward them to the convention city where you will be attending. Much work is required new method a try. It has worked for others; it may work for you. If, however, after having tried the new method you feel that you would prefer to offer the literature after the sermon instead of during it, you may do so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> When using the new sermon, remember to apply the essentials of good teaching. As ministers, we should have an accurate knowledge of these principles. Win the interest of the people first. Then build on what they already know. Talk in terms they can grasp. Ask questions that call for them to reason on the information you have already presented. Be ready to state your point and the purpose of your call in one or two simple sentences, using perhaps one scripture from the sermon, if people say they are busy. In this</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font14"> 4, col. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">for the successful operation of a convention. Why not share in the joy of doing this work? Many hands make the burden light, and this opens another way to “let your brotherly love continue.”-—Heb. 13 :1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Advertising the Peace-pursuing Assembly en route to the convention city is our privilege. How helpful in this respect are the attractive lapel cards prepared to fit the holder you have been using at conventions for the past fe-w years I Congregation servants may order the cards and celluloid holders needed for their congregations. The cards cost 1c each, the celluloid holders 5c. No bumper signs are being provided this' year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Be positive in your plans to attend the convention. Show love for the good-will persons with whom you study by including them in your plans to attend one of the Peacepursuing District Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theme: Promoting Accurate Knowledge in Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Welcome, text, comments and talk on theme for the month, “Promoting Accurate Knowledge in Ministers.” (See “Watchtower,” August 1, 1959, p. 457, and May 1, I960, p. 268.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">16 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Promote Accurate Knowledge in Ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">26 min: “God’s Purpose for Man” Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(2 min.) Enthusiastic talk by chairman on need for using effective new I field-tested sermon -with “Paradise” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(8 min.) Chairman will briefly develop sermon for the congregation, discussing the introduction, body and conclusion as set forth so all will have it basically in mind when the model presentations are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: God's Purpose for Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A suggested introduction: “Good morning. I am one of a group of Christian workers calling briefly to help thinking people understand God’s purpose for man. Many wonder in this day and age just what God’s purpose is for man, or whether he even cares about what is happening here. We usually have a purpose in mind when doing things, do we not? [Let them reply.! Likewise, it is reasonable to expect that God has a purpose for man, and he does. To know what his purpose is helps us to appreciate why we are here and what there is to live for in the future. God’s original purpose for mankind is clearly expressed here at Genesis 1:28.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. Gen. 1:28—Made earth paradise to be filled with perfect humans (Page 25, par. 26, gives talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. After reading Gen. 1: 28, take “Paradise” book out, turn to pages 20-21, saying, “Here is an illustration of what that paradise was like,” and place the book in the householder’s hands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. Briefly comment on illustration, then say, “As we know from reading Genesis, chapter three, that paradise was lost as a result of disobedience on the part of Adam and Eve. Did it mean God’s purpose for a paradise failed? Do you think it will ever be restored?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. Isa. 55:11—Positive assurance that God’s purpose will come to pass (Page 25, par. 27, for talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">5. Ps. 37: 10, 11—Earth will be filled with peaceful, perfect humans (Page 222, pars. 11-13, for talking points.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">6. After reading and briefly commenting on Psalm 37, ask householder to turn to page 241. Comment on illustration and pose question, How will this paradise be restored? Answer: The Kingdom we pray for as Jesus taught us at Matthew 6: 9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Conclusion: “Now is the time to learn more about God’s purpose for man and of his kingdom. This publication has helped me and thousands of other people to understand from the Bible what one must do to live in this regained paradise. You may have the copy in your hand for the small contribution of 75 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(6 min.) Call on publisher prepared in advance to give sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(2 min.) Audience given opportunity to make constructive comments regarding this presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(5 min.) Another publisher prepared </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font13">advance gives sermon, but waits until end of sermon to present book, at which time pages 20-21 are shown, with brief comment, and then page 241.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(3 min.) Encourage all to use new field-tested sermon. Publishers may use “Paradise” book early in sermon or at conclusion of sermon. Try it both ways and use one that works best for you. Keep in mind starting of studies when opportunity affords when placing book. Make definite-arrangements for return call so studies can be continued or started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Philippians 1:9, on page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">7 min: New World News, Divine Will Film and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Reading of pioneer letter and talk on pioneering, using material in letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Presenting the Good News.” Demonstrate points in it, including how to start a study after placement is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Talk based on article “How Is the Kingdom Work Financed?” in May 1, 1960, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article on “Peace-pursuing Assemblies in 1960.” (Note: Congregations attending June district assemblies should discuss this article during the second meeting in May.) 10 min: “Yearbook” experiences showing courage of new ones. Present as discussion, with one publisher encouraging another who has opposition at home. New ones often example to older ones in truth for keeping integrity. Daughter stood firm against opposition from mother and friends (171), young man against mistreatment by fanatical relatives (227) and a young child in spite of bitter opposition of father. (290) They came off “victorious through him that loved” them.—Rom. 8: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">22 min: Maintaining the Increase. (Use same group as previous months.) CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Discuss local increase: result of good work by publishers with Jehovah’s blessing. Goal not just a large figure in April, but starting many new praisers and thereafter helping them to become mature publishers. Do not forget them with April over or expect them to continue by themselves. Rather, help them build up appreciation and continue in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE I (2 min.) Assistant congregation servant to study conductor: Several new ones with his group published in April; now want to help all to continue, including new family, who have not reported as yet for May. Suggests conductor talk to publisher carrying on study to see why they have not been out and what can be done to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE II (8 min.) Study conductor commends publisher for good work of starting three new ones. No report from them for May. What has been done? Publisher asked them to go, but they were busy. He doesn’t want to push them, will wait for them to indicate desire to go out again. Conductor feels problem is not just beingbusy, suggests they observe family, find reason. (Watch from side of stage.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Family working at home Saturday. Wife sees a publisher in service, feels she should be doing same. Husband reminds her they have spring cleaning to do, there will be time later for talking religion to others. Daughter feels as father, and that it is not urgent, publisher did not stress it to them as in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Conductor and publisher analyze family: While Saturday is a busy day, reasons for not being out are: Scriptural importance for service not in evidence, which is to be expected as new as they are, and publisher did not sufficiently encourage them. Conductor suggests the following for after next study: (1) Scripturally encourage them to continue sharing truths. (2) Since Saturday cleaning day, encourage to go out Sunday. (3) Briefly discuss sermon to be used and how they can share. Publisher sees points, will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE HI (8 min.) After study, family express appreciation for new things learned. Publisher commends them for good preparation, asks, Wouldn’t it be wonderful if more people knew truths? All agree it would. Publishei' has all look up Romans 10: 8-10 and comments on importance of all telling wonderful truths learned to others. Goes over 3- to 8-minute sermon (having copy of “Kingdom Ministry”) he will give Sunday morning. Family comment on fine sermon. Publisher invites them to go along. Knows Saturday busy cleaning day, can go Sunday and even read and discuss third scripture in sermon and give handbill after presentation concluded. Suggests father could go with him, mother and daughter with others. Family readily accepts, definite arrangements made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Work to maintain increase by helping new ones as demonstrated. Aid them to see importance of continuing to share in ministry; make arrangements to take them out when they can go. Bring lasting results from April’s peak by helping new ones to progress toward maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Titus 3: 8, on page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">12 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Congregation Organization” and summary stressing key points of article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">13 min: Talk on article “Be a Teacher in the Training Program.” To be given by school servant or another capable brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” covering paragraphs 24 through 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font13">min: Talk encouraging all to share in Decoration Day magazine activity at cemetery or in house-to-house work. Short demonstration featuring use of special article in May 22 “Awake!” at cemetery, stressing need of talking with the person first in a friendly way before offering magazines.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Working Alone or Together</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The New World society is made up of those who are active servants of Jehovah God. Daily, hundreds more associate themselves witli Jehovah’s witnesses, and they too are encouraged to share in preaching and teaching the Kingdom good news. Following the pattern set by Jesus and. his apostles, we lovingly give instruction to these new ones and to others who are putting forth the effort to advance to maturity, and this is done by arranging for publishers to work by twos in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> As stated in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span><span class="font14"> paragraph 22, “Being companions in the service in this manner, we shall be able to help one another go on to maturity and, when we are able to present the message without difficulty, then, at every opportunity, we should go alone from house to house.” While very new ones usually work right along with a mature publisher for the entire period they are in the service, yet even these new ones, when properly trained, will soon want to begin making calls by themselves. In the training program, too, two publishers usually work together for the first half hour or so, and then they work alone, because they know that this will afford greater opportunity to apply the counsel given and to reach more people. Even a mature publisher may want to work a few homes with another capable publisher on occasion, with a view to improving the effectiveness of his own ministry;</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Especially when engaging in magazine work is it true that efficiency is greatly increased by working alone. The presentation is brief, and even young publishers and new ones find that they are soon able to handle it by themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> On back-calls and Bible studies, too, better use of service time can usually be made when one publisher goes on a call. However, there are times when it would be appropriate for a publisher to take along someone else. Some married couples even find that by making a call together they are able to draw the entire family into the study. However, discernment should be used to determine if the second publisher really is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Having these things in mind, when groups meet for service, the study conductor or group captain should not assign the publishers to work in pairs at the doors unless there is training to be done. However, at night and in dangerous neighborhoods it may be wise for two publishers to work fairly close to each other or even in pairs, depending on local circumstances.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>0</sup> In view of the urgency of the message we bear, let us make the best use of our service time. As Paul counseled: “Preach the word, be at it urgently.”—2 Tim. 4 : 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher in the Training Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The training program is designed to make less experienced publishers better publishers. To accomplish this, those who want help in one or more features of the ministry are assigned to work with those who are in position to help them and are willing to do so. To be effective, the publisher appointed to give assistance must be a teacher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Success in the training program requires keen interest in the assignment. On the part of the one giving assistance such interest will move him to plan carefully the program to be followed and to be patient and persevering in following through on it. In turn, the one being assisted can show appreciation for the help by working hard to apply counsel given, practicing both in the service and at home. Interest on the part of the congregation servant and the book study conductor in progress being made will also provide a stimulus to advancement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Regular instruction and application are vital for advancement in any' activity, and certainly so in the ministry. This calls for a schedule setting out times to prepare together and times to work together in the service. Make the schedule realistic, one that you can keep. If changed circumstances make the schedule impractical, promptly make the necessary adjustments to ensure regularity' of training.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Effective teaching in the training program calls for more than simply letting your companion observe how you carry on the ministry. After giving a sermon, analyze what you have done and the reasons for it. Offer constructive counsel to the one you are assisting, but be sure that the counsel is on the point that will do most to improve his effectiveness, not simply' the first weakness you observe. This will usually require that you hear his presentation a number of times in order to evaluate it properly. Be sure he understands the counsel given and can explain to you how it can be applied. It is usually' best to work on one point of counsel until it has been mastered before going on to another. Progressively, each feature of service can be given the attention that is needed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> While going to the territory, use the time wisely for teaching by discussing together introductions that may be used or how to overcome objections that are common in the territory. Then apply these suggestions as you work together.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Your effectiveness as a teacher is reflected in the progress of the one you are assisting.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> “My name is -----. I’m calling</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">to ask what, in youi’ opinion, is God’s purpose for man? [Let them comment if they wish, but don’t pause too long.] Some say man was put here to suffer and die before gaining bliss in heaven. Others claim God simply doesn’t care, and has no purpose for man. What is your</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> The Congregator “taught the people knowledge continually,” and so must we. &quot;The lips of the wise ones keep scattering knowledge about,” we are told. (Eccl. 12:9; Prov. 15:7) On Decoration Day, when many are out in the cemeteries mourning their deceased ones, we ought to be there to comfort them. “To comfort all the mourning ones” is part of our commission. (Isa. 61: 2) Arrangements should be made for cemetery and house-to-house witnessing on Decoration Day, using the May 22 issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> and the June 1 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> (Outstanding experiences should be mailed in to the Society.)

<p><span class="font14">there are others who are not exactly beginners, but who still need much help and encouragement. Let us not forget these, but by thorough preparation with them, by a good example, by constructive counsel and by step-by-step teaching promote accurate knowledge in these new ministers. Assist them to become spiritually strong so that they too can walk worthily of Jehovah and go on bearing fruit to his praise.</span></p>

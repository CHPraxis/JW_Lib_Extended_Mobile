<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">SEPTEMBER, 1960 “Seek peace and pursue ih For Jehovah’s eyes are upon the righteous.”—1 Pet. 3:11,12. VOL Hl NO. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At the 1960 district assemblies our Grand Instructor provided much practical counsel on study, meetings, service and personal conduct, and during the service year just beginning we will work conscientiously to apply it. We will also want to improve our teaching ability, realizing its effectiveness to teach others of Jehovah. With Moses we agree: “In all the way that Jehovah your God has commanded you, you should walk in order that you may live and it may be well with you.” —Deut. 5 : 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Service Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We enter the new service year with vacationers returning home, schools opening and harvest at hand. The spiritual harvest is also ripe! Congregations should post the 10-percent quotas for December, while mature ministers make personal schedules for study and service. Resume Bible studies that might have been discontinued for the summer. Plan to attend Sunday morning meetings for group witnessing regularly. Proper organization of midweek group witnessing will accomplish much good for those whose service is limited on Sunday. When in the service, rather than be satisfied merely to place literature, try to start studies when making placements. Where this cannot be done, call back soon, using the simplified back-call sermon outlined in the August </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> as an aid in starting a study. Many publishers and householders find Sunday convenient for having a study. The Society will be glad to hear from you on your experiences in using the simplified back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Responding to Jehovah’s love, congregations should arrange for a special Magazine Day on Labor Day. If you cannot attend the congregation meeting for group witnessing, have some share in this important service by going direct to your own territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Unassigned Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> September concludes unassigned territory witnessing for the year. After completing the territory please report what has been done. Forward to the Society experiences and the names and addresses of interested persons, as well as names of those who should be on the isolated publisher list. It will aid us if you submit such names of good-will persons on individual slips of paper, 3x5 inches. Remember to correspond with those of good will to stimulate their growth in Jehovah’s</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each month a combined total of over 134 million copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> comes off the Society’s presses, and every possible effort is made to get them into the hands of the people. Why? Because these journals contain information that all persons of good will need in order to gain life. Since the articles are short and our Magazine Day presentations are also brief, people with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> minimum of interest will often take the magazines, and this in many cases proves to be their first step toward association with Jehovah’s New World society. What a privilege is ours to make these publications available to them!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Appreciating what </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aivake!</span><span class="font11"> may mean to the ones to whom we offer them, we should all have a regular share in magazine distribution. Do you have time set aside for this activity each week? Are you regularly meeting your magazine quota? way. Under the congregation servant’s supervision, mature infirm publishers will enjoy writing to those living in unassigned territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Healthy Service Centers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Study conductors, are you regularly making personal calls on each publisher in your service center? Stimulate all to improve personal study, meeting attendance and regularity in Kingdom service. See that new and less experienced ones get needed assistance to follow Jehovah’s way and lengthen their days on into his new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Motivated by love and appreciation for Jehovah’s Word and organization, let us enter the new service year demonstrating the truthfulness of the psalmist’s words: “Happy are the ones faultless in their way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.”—Ps. 119 :1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The magazine quota for congregation publishers in all types of territory is 12; for regular and vacation pioneers, 100; for special pioneers, 150. During the 1957 and 1958 service years congregation publishers did very well in this activity, averaging 12.4 and 12.5 magazines. For the 1959 service year the average dropped to 11.9, and again for the first ten months of the 1960 service year the average is a little below our quota of 12. Vacation pioneers have averaged 77 per month, and regular pioneers, 98, Special pioneers have gone up from 144 to 148 per month. Compare your own averages with the quotas shown above. Is there room for improvement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Many individual publishers, congregations and entire circuits are doing excellent work with the magazines, regularly meeting or exceeding their quota and enjoying the rich</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Following Jehovah’s Way in His Name.” (See “Watchtower,” September 1, 1959, pp. 520-532, and September 1, 1960, p. 542.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: New World News report and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article on “Improving Service Meet- i ings.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: “Yearbook” experiences on meeting the magazine quota. A publisher tells another publisher about his difficulty in reaching'the magazine quota. He is told that it can be done by following suggestions from the Society. (See “Your Service Meetings,” April, 1960, “Kingdom Ministry.”) Reference is made to “Yearbook” for encouraging examples. Taking the initiative helped a sister reach her quota. (192) A circuit servant reached his by missing no one. (119) Publisher is encouraged to be alert to all opportunities to place magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Regularly Place the Magazine Quota.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: The Training Program in Operation. (Use same group as previous months.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Last month training program w’as organized for new publishers. Organization essential, but key to success is effective activity by publishers assigned. Progress begins with preparation for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (3 min.) Companions pantomime preparation of sermon. Chairman narrates: Mature reviews necessities for good introductions: friendly, striking, interest-arousing, etc. New publisher practices introductions they have developed, does well. Now he will put these to use in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Study period for working on sermons may be after field service, after a meeting, or at any other time convenient for both companions. It is a vital part of training program, because preparation is essential to progress in the ministry. Now observe companions in service. New publisher has given sermon. Mature is giving commendation and helpful counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (4 min.) Mature commends on introductions and other good points; suggests as point to strengthen: use of theme. They discuss emphasis of theme to get point of current sermon across: that God’s will is to be done on earth. Mature suggests that new publisher watch development of theme as Mature delivers sermon. They approach door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) After this they will work alone for an hour, then spend last half hour together. Mature will see what progress companion has made. New publisher has seen what is needed, applied himself. See him deliver sermon now while working alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE III (8 min.) New publisher delivers model sermon: simple, coherent, using good teaching methods. Householder readily accepts offer. Publisher alertly offers to demonstrate use of publications. Householder does not have time now, so he arranges to call when the rest of the family will be home too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Training program effectively accomplishing purpose, will, in time, complete effort started less than a year ago by Mature when he contacted this man of good will, made back-call on him and his family, conducted Bible study, directed their interest to organization, started him in service, helped him continue, protected him in time of trial, explained dedication and baptism, now is training him. He responded, took stand, made dedication, now is directing other men of good will to the way to life. Cycle is complete, and another effective Kingdom publisher is doing the divine will. Are you alert as Mature was in helping interested ones to study and directing them into the organization? Apply these theocratic methods in constant endeavor to help new ones gain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk, together with questions and answers, on “Pursue Peace as a Pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Special Issue of ‘Awake!’ ” Discuss apt reasons for placing the special issue with people in your territory. Demonstrate how it may be presented effectively. (If you have a fifth meeting in September, then consider this part at that time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Analyzing Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each publisher should have his Publisher’s Record card showing year’s totals and averages, also paper and pencil for notes. Have totals and averages of congregation’s entire year’s report displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Another service year ended; it is time to pause, consider progress made, what is yet to be done, and how we can become ever more effective. All share in giving-upbuilding suggestions. (Heb. 10: 24; Gal. 6: 2) Take notes for personal improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (17 min.) Discuss congregation’s year’s report, a column at a time, considering congregation total, average per publisher, and inviting publishers to compare their averages with congregation’s. Show what figures mean in terms of help to good-will persons and praise to Jehovah. Each publisher’s activity important in compiling this total. Particularly with hours, magazines, back-calls and Bible studies, consider how well congregation did. Entertain suggestions for improvement where needed. Did we equal the nation in average hours? Did we average 12 magazines? one Bible study? (Before meeting, chairman may ascertain from publishers specific problems relative to congregation’s weak points and have these raised for discussion.) Call for suggestions on overcoming these and other weak points. Show how quotas can easily be reached by each publisher. Make discussion lively, with all expressing themselves freely to help one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most important, what has this activity accomplished? Compare number of publishers, number regular publishers, and number of baptized publishers in September, 1959, with August, 1960, commending congregation for progress made. Now, how can we maintain our progress and/or do even better? Draw out thoughts on effective teaching in all features of the ministry, working with a purpose, making time count, being optimistic and progressive, directing interest to the organization, etc. Show how the suggestions can be effectively used locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Results of all applying these suggestions: increased praise to Jehovah; more benefit to good-will persons; improved theocratic spirit, greater maturity, growth in the congregation; better spiritual health, balanced ministry, increased effectiveness, more results, more joy from service for publishers. To see this in your congregation, make use of the things learned. Review your notes. Discuss with one another the suggestions given. Apply them in the ministry. Seek not only to engage in the ministry, but to get results in gathering the sheep into the fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on the text [Luke 9: 23] at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregations having a fifth service meeting may spend 15 to 20 minutes covering paragraphs 77 through 87 in “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.” Congregations having a fifth service meeting in August may consider this material then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Place Magazine Quota &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">blessings that go with participation in this feature of the ministry. What has brought these good results? Jehovah has blessed their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regularity </span><span class="font11">in magazine service. Those who meet the quota are usually publishers who have a regular time set aside for this service each week and who use brief, enthusiastic presentations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The magazines are always of current interest because they stress the relationship of world happenings to Bible prophecies, and they show how Scriptural principles answer the problems of daily life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We can prove ourselves a blessing to the people in the territory where we minister by seeing to it that they are regularly afforded the opportunity to obtain </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> This month and throughout the new service year let us all use them well.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Service Meetings (Part 2)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Demonstrations are an important part of our service meetings. For a demonstration to be effective, it must, in the short time allotted, portray a good example of what is expected in the way of a sermon, Christian conduct, preparation for service or meetings, etc. It must be not only interesting but instructive. This requires teaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The brother assigned to develop a demonstration must study thoroughly the outline and instructions given in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> and by the congregation servant, so that he knows just what is required. Then he will select brothers and sisters to assist him, having in mind their ability to handle the various parts. The outline is a framework that is flexible, yet having a definite purpose and objective that should always be kept in mind. Build on this with originality. Being adaptable, it can be slanted so as to cover some particular local weakness within the purpose of the demonstration. The congregation servant can give directions on this, as well as suggestions on who may be used to handle the parts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Hardly any demonstration can be presented effectively without one or more rehearsals. It is well for the congregation servant, or a brother appointed by him occasionally, to oversee rehearsals and make practical suggestions for improvement. Often brothers and sisters within</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">one or two service centers and who live close to one another can be used; this makes it convenient for them to get together. Perhaps they can go over the demonstration the first time or two after the book study, or another time, and then have a final rehearsal at the Kingdom Hall so all will know their routine on the platform and proper use of the microphone, if one is used. Rehearsals work for smoothness, confidence on the part of the participants and keeping within the allotted time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Naturalness</span><span class="font11"> is essential. It is important that each participant understand his part well and know what is expected. Even the publisher who serves as the householder should have explained to him just what type of householder he should portray. Avoid the spectacular. Stage props, except simple things, are not needed. The main objective is to get across practical suggestions for improving our teaching ability in a positive, enthusiastic way. This eliminates the negative approach of demonstrating the wrong way. It is better to see the right way so we can improve or correct ourselves where necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It is a privilege to appear in demonstrations. Those publishers participating can do much to assist others in the congregation by getting the spirit of the demonstration and living the parts, so that all who see it can see themselves using in the field or in other theocratic activities the practical points presented.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Teaching at the &quot;Watchtower&quot; Study</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah teaches us through the organizational meetings, especially the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. (Isa. 48 ; 17) Servants, too, must be “qualified to teach,” and this is particularly true of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study conductor. How vital for him to employ teaching methods here! More than covering the assigned material is required. He must teach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Thorough preparation by the conductor is essential and study must </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font11">approached with teaching in mind. He ought to be well acquainted with the article being studied. He should be able to anticipate portions that may be difficult and need particular attention. He must ascertain in advance the principal ideas in the lesson and make them stand out clearly at the study. These are not simply minor points of interest to the conductor; the selection is governed by the article’s theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To teach, the conductor needs more than an understanding of the material. He needs to understand the audience. What are the congregation’s needs? How can the points be applied to local problems?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Opening remarks, prepared In advance, should focus attention on main ideas and create expectation for what is to be considered. Throughout the study the theme or objective of the article should be kept to the fore. The conductor can help do this by reading the questions with proper sense stress, and by his own brief remarks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The conductor, not the audience, determines when a paragraph has been covered. Instead of saying, “If there are no further comments we’ll have the paragraph read,” he should be sure that all the important points have been covered to the extent that time permits before calling for the sum-up. What if some main ideas have not been expressed? Then the conductor can ask pointed questions to draw out the answers from the audience. He should also encourage the publishers to comment on the scriptures in the paragraphs. In order to learn, the audience ought to do most of the talking. That means that the conductor will limit his own comments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Reading of the paragraphs can also be done with a view to teaching. With proper sense stress and enthusiasm, the reader should drive home the important points. Thus, with the conductor as well as the reader paying close attention to teaching principles, all will leave the study with increased appreciation for Jehovah and his service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Those Who Say: “Why do you come around so often?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In some places the congregations are covering their territory quite frequently. In these places and others we often meet this objection. Sometimes brothers are influenced by these comments to feel that the territory is being covered too often.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Such is not the case, however. The congregation really should rejoice. The people are hearing the good news; the congregation is keeping itself clean from the blood of all men. The people become acquainted with the message and with us as Witnesses and begin to see our peace-pursuing ways and our sincere desire to help them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In many of the larger cities this is taking place. As an example, one congregation in New York city has service centers each having as its entire territory only a 14-story apartment house with ten apartments on each floor. Here and in other congregations the people are visited with the Kingdom message Tuesday evening, Saturday and Sunday! The result? These congregations regularly exceed their quotas for the 10-percent and 20-percent increases in December and April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When the question, “Why do you come around so often?” is asked, you could reply: “Because of the im</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How privileged are those who can be full-time publishers of good news and peace! At the Peace-pursuing District Assemblies the invitation was extended to all dedicated and baptized publishers who meet the requirements to pursue peace as a pioneer. Have you seriously and prayerfully considered the invitation and acted upon it?—Isa. 52: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The most desirable way to ‘make peace to be heard’ is to be a pioneer. Not all are able to embrace this privilege, but is it within your power to pioneer? Are you able to help someone in your family pioneer? Let there be no mistake: we have an obligation to Jehovah and to all lovers of peace; as Proverbs 3: 27 states it: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, portance of the work I am doing, I would truly feel accountable to God if I should pass your door. He has commanded that the good news be preached so that everyone has an opportunity to hear. Jesus foretold this work at Matthew 24:14.” (Read.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You may say: “Because I am sincerely interested in your welfare. Our work is too important for us to be coming out of mere persistence, to trouble you. When a storm is coming, people like to receive periodic warnings. Everyone is in peril from what is coming on this world, but there is a way of safety and that is good news.” (Then you could read Psalm 37:10, 11 in support of your answer.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Or your reply might be: “You know, the people must have wondered the same thing about Jesus and his disciples. In Jerusalem there were at one time three thousand of them calling on the homes of the people there. [Acts 2:41, 46, 47] It helped many to hear the word of God; later many more joined them in preaching.”—Acts 4: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> A kind remark of such nature, coupled with patience and tact, may result in an opportunity to talk to some who had previously failed to see the importance of listening to you.—2 Cor. 5 :11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it.” Let us, then, not hold back from bringing good news and making peace heard as a pioneer if it is within our power to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Thousands of persons from all circumstances in life have found it within their power to pioneer. They have put forth the effort, trusting also that Jehovah will help them, and now they are happier than ever before in their life. Pursuing peace as a pioneer increases our capacity for happiness. (Acts 20: 35) It helps keep our spiritual vision keen, gives us peace of mind and answers the question: How can I care for all the interest found? Are you able to pursue peace as a pioneer?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Society is providing a special October 8 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> on the theme “The Catholic Church in the Twentieth Century.” This issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> frankly sets out what </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">those prominent in the Catholic church itself say</span><span class="font11"> about their attitude toward the Bible, their suppression of freedom, participation in the two world wars, viewpoint on morals, and other related topics.</span></p></li>

On April 10 there will no doubt be more people gathered than ever before to commemorate the Memorial of the death of the Lord Jesus.

<p><span class="font10">Public Meeting, April 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It will be a pleasure to invite everyone with whom we come in contact to the timely public talk “Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom of Heaven.” Disarmament is a topic that is constantly in the news; people talk about it; they desperately want an answer to the situation. We know they will get the answer in the public talk. When inviting them to come, be enthusiastic and confident. Stimulate curiosity so they will want to hear the talk. You might ask questions such as these: Will the nations succeed in bringing about disarmament, or is nuclear war unavoidable? Is it possible to disarm and yet maintain security? What can be done to guarantee co-operation among the races and peace among the nations? Will our homes forever</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on “Guarding Freedom for Doing God’s Complete Will.” (See “Watchtower,” May 1, 1959, pp. 261-274, and April 1, 1960, p. 222.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of paragraphs 1-5 of main article, “Use Freedom to Do God’s Will in April.” No introductory talk needed; concentrate on material in “Kingdom Ministry.” Work in two or three brief demonstrations of suggestions in paragraph 2; also demonstrate first suggestion in paragraph 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: Talk on “Zealous Service at Memorial Time,” developing points in paragraph 6 of main article, “Use Freedom to Do God’s Will in April.” 15 min: Questions and answers on “Increasing the Number of Publishers,” and “Magazine Distribution,” covering paragraphs 7-11 of main article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. (Head and discuss letter from Brother Knorr, on first page of “Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK OF APRIL 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Use of April 15 “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In brief introductory talk, point out why it is important to give this issue wide distribution. Mention the many opportunities there are to place the magazine, emphasizing those other than regular house-to-house magazine work. In connection with using the magazines with the sermon, point out choice excerpts from the April 15 issue that could be used at the end of the sermon. Have it demonstrated briefly. Discuss how two magazines may be offered when the subscription is not accepted. Demonstrate this. If any publishers have already had good experiences in distributing the issue, call on them to relate them. (These should be planned in advance.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Offering Magazines from House to House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (12 min.) Our own enthusiastic activity, coupled with the fine magazines we have for distribution, can easily make April an all-time peak month for magazine distribution. Review opportunities to share in house-to-house magazine distribution. Urge all to participate at times that are convenient to them. Let us all have a part in magazine distribution some each week during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Below are a number of suggestions for effective magazine distribution. Discuss each with the congregation, asking publishers why the point is important and how to apply it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Have friendly smile, friendly tone of voice, perhaps friendly comment: “I am glad to find you at home.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Be enthusiastic about magazines you are offering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Use good articulation and unhurried delivery.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Speak on only one theme at a door, such as family security, world peace, the moral crisis, etc., and tie it in with the magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">5. Usually highlight just one article. It should match your theme and be especially appropriate for householder. Open to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. Briefly show value of subject to householder. For Magazine Day do not usually discuss at length contents of article; briefly stimulate interest in subject and then offer magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">7. Feature only one magazine, offering other as companion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">8. If you have not done so earlier, at the moment you actually offer the magazines hand them to the householder, though not in overbearing way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">9. Prepare the way for return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">10. Have friendly, positive conclusion when magazines are refused.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">DEMONSTRATION (10 min.) Have several magazine presentations, including suggestions for “Watchtower” under “Presenting the Good News.” After each one call on publishers to point out from list above two or three suggestions that were applied particularly well, but no negative counsel. However, at the end, if chairman observes that certain suggestions have not been emphasized, draw attention to them and demonstrate the points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Before going in service, practice your presentation. Go over it aloud, either by yourself or with someone else. This preparation will increase your effectiveness. i 10 min: Talk on theme “Welcome the Stranger.” Point out the importance of the Memorial. Discuss what can be done in the next few’ days to aid new ones to attend. Ask audience for suggestions on how to make new ones welcome when they come Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comments on slogan, based on Hebrews 10: 24, 25, on page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK OF APRIL 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Using the April 22 “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brief talk on value of April 22 “Awake!” Stress reason why we want to get it into the hands of everyone in our territory. Demonstrate suggestions on “Awake!” presentations found under “Presenting the Good News”; use others as time permits. Chairman may call for publishers to point out good features of magazine presentations, highlighting the suggestions given on the previous service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Demonstration: Starting New Publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) April is month for 20-percent increase. Most persons studied with need to be shown importance of ministry to them before starting. Proper preparation and encouragement necessary. Family who started attending meetings last month now to be helped in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (9 min.) After study, publisher explains he wants to discuss with them preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Father states they have wondered about it. Publisher explains Bible lectures not only method of preaching. Early Christians went to homes of people. (Acts 20: 20) Jesus revealed importance of finding and feeding the sheep, at Matthew 24: 14 and John 21: 15-17. This is done by all who love truth learned. Truth moves them to want to tell others; find joy in ministry. Family can experience this joy by telling what they know to others. (Rev. 22: 17) Family invited to go with him Saturday or Sunday. Wife expresses desire to go Saturday; husband and daughter say, “Maybe later; not now.” Publisher will look forward to their going later. He makes definite arrangements to take wife in magazine work. Publisher illustrates simple 30- to 60-second presentation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I to be used; leaves copy to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Publisher has taken wife in service. Let’s look in on next study and see what publisher does to help father and daughter at conclusion of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (10 min.) In response to publisher’s inquiry as to whether wife had opportunity to tell husband and daughter good experiences enjoyed, husband remarks it is all they have heard since. Wife expresses appreciation for field service, hopes sweet woman who took magazines will read them. Publisher explains return call will be made by them; encourages husband and daughter to share same joy, showing again responsibility and privilege of sharing what they know. (All look up scriptures together.) To be real Christians we must follow Christ, share in ministry. (1 Pet. 2: 21) Family wants salvation; Romans 10: 8-10 tells how it is gained. An experienced minister will go with each one, they can listen to him at a few doors until ready to give presentation. With wife’s encouragement, father and daughter agree to go Saturday. Publisher has written out magazine presentation in “Kingdom Ministry,” shows family how easy it is to use. All agree to learn it; definite arrangements made to go out Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After publisher goes, family tries presentation on one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) For good-will persons to find life, sharing in ministry essential. Do not think they cannot or will not go out. Years of study not necessary. Use these suggestions and help ones you study with to share in the ministry starting in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include local experiences had in getting new ones into the service. These should be planned in advance. If more are needed, see “Yearbook,” pp. 115, 150.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK OF APRIL 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Report from study conductors on meeting with congregation servant. 15 min: Reading of pioneer letter and talk on pioneering, using material in letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: Talk and demonstration on the article “Be a Teacher of New Ones,” by school servant or another capable brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include experiences had in placing magazines during April. These should be selected in advance.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK OF APRIL 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of booklet “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” covering paragraphs 18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk on “The Joy of Serving Jehovah.” Build warm appreciation for the privilege that is ours as Jehovah’s witnesses to preach and teach, to aid our brothers in theocratic activity and to train new ones in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Our Magazine Activity. A report from the magazine-territory servant on results thus far of magazine activity during April, commending publishers for good work done. Outline magazine service that can yet be done this month-. Have several demonstrations of effective 30- to 60-second presentations of magazines that could be used in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on Titus 2: 14, at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jse Freedom to Do God's Will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Confd) </span><span class="font12">be sure to welcome them, introduce them to others—yes, make them feel at home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Since no other meeting will be held before or after the Memorial on Sunday evening, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study may be scheduled for the day before—Saturday afternoon or evening. It may be held at the Kingdom Hall or at the service centers if this is more convenient.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When we call to mind the intensive service activity of the Lord Jesus during the days that preceded Nisan 14, A.D. 33, and the work he carried on during the days following his resurrection (as outlined on page 287 in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”), </span><span class="font12">it moves us to copy his zealous example. During Memorial week endeavor to reach a personal quota of five hours of service. One and all, let us make the entire month of April the outstanding one in our service year. Each congregation will no doubt make every weekend in April an occasion of intensified service, but there are seven days each week in which we can praise Jehovah, and the congregation should also make arrangements for meetings for field service at other times that are convenient to the publishers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Increasing the Number of Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> April’s activity should be a stimulus to many new ones to start in the service. Our 20-percent goal is 265,488 publishers, and surely there are many with whom we are studying that will be included in that number if we invite them. The article “An Invitation to Preach,” in the April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> should be a great aid. First, read it yourself; then, where appropriate, discuss it with those with whom you are studying. If they are ready for service, make definite arrangements for them to go with you. If you have endeavored to help them to see their responsibility to serve Jehovah, a definite invitation is often all that is needed for them to start.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> There are many others in our midst who appreciate the assistance of mature ones in the service. They are already publishers, but home circumstances may make it difficult for them to go with the group. Gall on them, find out when they can go, invite them to work with you. From the first of the month servants will be alert to help those who need assistance; the rest of us can be too. Keep in mind the principle: “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.” (1 Cor. 10:24) With all of us encouraging one another, what a grand month of service April will prove to be I</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Magazine Distribution</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Another outstanding feature of April’s activity will be magazine distribution. When you receive the special issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> read them right away. You will be delighted with their contents. These magazines contain information that you will want to get into every home in your territory. In the April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">is the important article “Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom of Heaven.” Offer it all month until every one has been placed. The April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> asks in bold letters across the front cover; “Is a righteous world possible?” This issue, made up almost entirely of Bible articles, is designed to help people see their need of the truth, what course to follow today, the hope of God’s righteous new world, what the New World society is, and how they can associate with it. Both of these magazines will appeal to people of all walks of life, and they will be a blessing to all who want to do the will of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> In order to get this information into the hands of everyone possible, we all have special magazine quotas for April: Congregation publishers, 30 each; pioneers, 120; special pioneers, 180. Can we do it? Yes! Start work the first day of the month, using the issues you have. After the public talk April 3 the special April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will be released for use. Plan to be in service with the magazines each week during April. Have well-prepared presentations. Be enthusiastic. Offer them to everyone you meet all month. Mail copies to persons you feel would read them but who may not otherwise receive them. Arrangements can be made to meet for magazine distribution on weekdays, before book studies, and both morning and afternoon on Saturdays. What about special activity for those who have time free for Easter holidays? Most publishers will be able to meet with the group for some of these activities, some will be able to share in all, but all of us can have some share in the service, and that we want to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Remember, too, that April is the last month of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">subscription campaign. Publishers report that householders will really ‘listen to this sermon on prayer.’ Continue to use it, along with the subscription offer. Follow up on all subscription promises and expiration notices this month. Make it possible for others to have this life-giving information come to them regularly during the year to come. Guard your freedom to do God’s complete will by helping others to learn it.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be a Teacher of New Ones</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Being a teacher of new ones in the field ministry involves four essentials. Let us examine them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>2</sup> Preparation : Help the new one learn the current sermon, possibly teaching him one scripture each week after the study. Go over the sermon with him before you start out in the regular house-to-house field ministry. Explain how you are going to develop particular points. Prepare him with knowledge of the dividing work so he knows that both sheeplike and goatish persons will be found. (Matt. 25:31-46) Prayer before service can teach reliance on Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>3</sup> Being an example : Show real enthusiasm yourself. Radiate zeal and love for the ministry. Be tactful. Try to avoid long discussions. Let simplicity help you teach; it will help the new one see that you are holding to a theme and help him grasp transitions. Let parents also set an example for their children, taking them regularly in the ministry, teaching them as methodically as they do adults.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>4</sup> Constructive counsel : Corrective teaching should not dampen the new one’s enthusiasm or discourage him. When correction is needed, be patient, kind and encouraging. Never the “you-did-it-all-wrong” attitude! Rather, you demonstrate the correct way; then draw attention to the advantages in what you have done and encourage him to try it. Commend the new one on good points and progress made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>5</sup> Step-by-step teaching: In house-to-house service rarely will it be necessary to stop and teach extensively. Rather than have extended discussions on the sidewalk, save some points for after the service. Most of the necessary instruction can be given while walking to the next house. Take a point at a time. Each call could yield many points for instruction, but do not try to teach all at once. Step-by-step teaching will not discourage the new one nor markedly slow down your house-to-house work. At one door you may ask the new one to pay attention to the introduction, as he will have opportunity to try it at the next house. Cover other points one by one. As the new one progresses, invite him to take a few houses alone. At the close of service arrange for a time to work together again. Continue to study with the new one if he has not yet studied the basic books. Use the four essentials—preparation, being an example, constructive counsel and step-by-step teaching—to become an effective teacher of new ones.</span></p>

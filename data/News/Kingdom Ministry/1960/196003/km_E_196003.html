<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As ambassadors of Jehovah’s perfect government, already established in heaven, we have the grand privilege of aiding others to become reconciled to God and to his perfect government and to receive its benefits.—2 Cor. 5:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Having reached the halfwaypoint in the subscription campaign, it is well to analyze how we are doing in using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> as an instrument of reconciliation. As a publisher, have you obtained at least one new subscription, ten as a pioneer, or fifteen as a special pioneer? The best way to obtain subscriptions is by sharing regularly each week in house-to-house work with the offer and by following up on all subscription promises. Do you? The sermon on prayer has proved to be very effective in this work, especially when publishers are able to draw the householder into the conversation. Exchange ideas with other publishers on how to do this effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Do not overlook incidental witnessing as a means of obtaining subscriptions. In 1959 a brother said: “I have always taken advantage of incidental witnessing. Dor a few years I took fifteen or twenty subscriptions each time we had our subscription campaign. Last year I obtained forty-three subscriptions and this year I took sixty-one.” Yes, incidental witnessing can be fruitful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Since we are sincerely interested in aiding sheeplike ones to seek reconciliation with God’s perfect government, we should call back on all new subscribers as soon as possible and endeavor to start home Bible studies. Try the practical suggestion for starting studies that was '-.ven in last month’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry;</span><span class="font12"> it has proved very effective. Also, many are continuing to have excellent results in starting studies on the initial call, using one of the study booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Persons who are being reconciled to God with the help of our ministry should by all means attend the Memorial. Begin talking with them about it now, and then, commencing March 27, you can leave witli them a printed invitation to attend. Let us make March 27 an outstanding day for service by following up an hour or two of house-to-house witnessing with as many calls as we</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What joy to a family to have guests over for a special dinner! Getting ready for such an occasion, however, often means a lot of hard work and thoughtful planning. But what family complains about the work involved at feast times? The work is considered a privilege and a pleasure—a mark of Christian hospitality. So our April's feast should be viewed for which we are getting ready. It, no doubt, will mean a Jot of hard work, but the</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">work will be an expression of our love and it will bring us much pleasure and great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> There is so much to get ready for in April that special ways will be needed to keep everyone alert to all the activity. If possible, plan to be a vacation pioneer during April. I/it us all keep our appreciation alive and ready for the occasion. Certainly we have the best food ever, the good news of God’s established kingdom; truths that set can make on interested persons, including subscribers, to present them with a Memorial invitation. How these invitations should be distributed will be considered in the service meeting during the week of March 20. Because of the Memorial, this meeting, as well as service meetings for the weeks of March 27 and April 3 will be of special concern to all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Our interest in seeing people reconciled to God and his perfect government is reflected in our desire </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> With the help of the special meetings outlined for us for the weeks of March 20 and 27, we should be well on our way in getting things ready for April’s feast. No doubt, we have already begun to invite guests to the special talk “Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom of Heaven” scheduled for April 3, and to tlie Kingdom Hall for the Memorial, April 10. Study conductors will want to be alert, because they will have a big share in playing up the special activity. See that every means is used to inform good-will persons of these events, such as the mails, the telephone, personal contact, and so forth, so that all are invited.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">22 min: </span><span class="font11">Directing Interested Ones to the Organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Congregation has studies with many people. Must associate with organization for life. Cannot start too early to encourage association. Observe how it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (5 min.) (Note: Use same publisher and family as in demonstration last month on starting study.) Bible study servant talking to publisher about Bible study. Publisher enthusiastic about it. Servant asks if they have been at Kingdom Hall yet. No, but publisher is sure they will be soon. Servant asks how they are being directed to organization. Publisher has talked to them about the organization after each study; has covered “Jehovah and Christ as Superior Authorities, Head of Organization” and “Constitution Is Bible” (from “Make Sure of All Things”). Servant commends, suggests family ready for contact with local organization. Never too soon to invite to meetings. Use “Yearbook” experience on page 191. Publisher asks how to go about inviting. Study 55 in “Qualified to Be Ministers” referred to-by servant. He suggests public meeting first, making definite arrangements to bring to meeting. Publisher appreciates suggestions; will use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (3 min.) Family all prepared for study, are discussing Jehovah’s witnesses before publisher arrives. They observe that doctrines certainly are based oh Bible, impressed by Biblical organization. But do they have churches? What kind of services? Private or public? If there is anything they can attend, they conclude, publisher will inform them when they are eligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE III (6 min.) Study concluded, publisher explains they have discussed various things about organization of Jehovah’s witnesses recently; tonight will talk about congregation meetings, particularly Sunday Bible sermon. As Jesus and apostles gave Bible sermons, open to public (Matt. 5: 1, 2; Acts 17: 22), so do Jehovah’s witnesses today. Christians commanded to meet together. (Heb. 10: 25) Accordingly, all congregations assemble in Kingdom Halls. Kingdom Hall described, way of conducting meetings, no collections, explained. Persons they know that attend are mentioned. Highlights of previous lectures related, importance of Sunday talk subject emphasized; invitation given them to attend. They agree to go; definite arrangements made to go together. Family given few handbills to invite friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE IV (2 min.) After publisher leaves, family expresses gratitude for information, looking forward to talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Many with ■whom we study just like this— wondering about organization. Responsive students result from alive teachers. Progressively teach them about organization. Give information each week, using material from sources this publisher did, also “Watchtower” articles, etc. Start now, if you are not doing so, even if study new<sup>T</sup>. Direct them to Jehovah’s organization as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion on “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Inviting Others to the Memorial and the Special Public Talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) April activity brings interesting variety to our ministerial schedule. Special talk April 3 in all congregations. Memorial, Sunday evening, April 10. Encourage all to support both. Society suggests calling on all subscribers for “Watchtower” and “Awake!” as ■well as all other known persons of good will with Memorial handbill. Procedure to be followed in giving out subscribers’ names as outlined in Congregation Organization is briefly discussed from a local standpoint. Preparation needed for efficient handling of these calls. See arrangements demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (5 min.) Study conductor, distributing names and addresses of subscribers at service center, enthusiastically tells publishers largest attendance ever expected at April 3 talk and Lord’s evening meal, April 10. All publishers should attend and aid good-will persons to be there. Society has prepared attractive handbill to invite subscribers and other interested persons to Memorial. Each publisher to call on those from whom subscriptions obtained. One publisher has so many she feels she may not be able to call on all of them. Conductor arranges for others to assist. Asks publishers what they will say when delivering invitations. One volunteers: “Oh, I’ll just say we are inviting them to attend the Memorial on April 10 and the special talk on April 3 and give them the handbills.” Conductor agrees this is one method to use, but suggests they watch publisher who has prepared brief message to use when delivering invitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (4 min.) After introducing himself to householder, publisher says: ‘We are making calls on all Watchtower’ [or ‘Awake!’] subscribers, personally inviting them to two important events soon to be held by Jehovah’s witnesses. The first event is the talk being given world-wide, ‘Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom of Heaven.’ Disarmament will bring peace, as nations will learn war no more. As Isaiah 2: 4 says, . . . [reads from Bible]. We are sure you will want to attend and learn when and how this will come about. Whether you are able to attend or not we especially want to invite you to the most important event of the year for all Christians, the commemoration of the Memorial of Christ’s death. This is the only celebration Christians are commanded to keep. Note Jesus’ words at Luke 22:19 . . . Tn obedience to Jesus’ command, Jehovah’s witnesses and others of good will will be meeting-on April 10 for the celebration in 20,000 congregations world-wide. It will be held . . . [shows time and place on Memorial handbill].” Householder agrees she will try to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Discuss with group points made. Suggest they try to place the April 1 “Watchtower,” which contains the article “The Anniversary That Must Be Kept by Christians,” with all who do not subscribe. Then discuss briefly together the main points in this article so all will be prepared to answer questions they may be asked about the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Make effective use of Memorial handbills by being prepared to call. Be sure all subscribers are invited and, where necessary, aided to attend. Our diligence and zeal will bring Jehovah’s blessing and favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH WEEK IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Congregations that have a fifth service meeting should use the first service meeting in the April “Kingdom Ministry.” It will contain additional instructions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Inviting Good-Will Persons to Memorial and Special Lecture</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> This year we will keep the Lord’s evening meal on April 10, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. All should be present—not only those who regularly attend our meetings, but all the interested ones in our territory. Also, we want to invite all ’o attend the special April 3 public talk. To aid us in reaching these the Society is printing a special invitation to the Memorial and a handbill for the special talk. All on whom back-calls are being made and with -whom Bible studies are being-conducted should receive both invitations. But we want, to go farther than this. Call on the many subscribers for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The congregation servant should arrange for the accounts servant, and several publishers as assistants, if necessary, to list on sheets of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record sheets (S-10) since January, 1959. Beside each subscriber's name should be shown the name of the publisher, since the Society would like for each publisher who obtained subscriptions to call back personally and deliver the invitations. The sheets might be cut into slips to be distributed to the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Where there are slips for publishers who have moved or if one publisher has more than he can care for, other publishers may assist with delivering the invitations. The slips should be ready for distribution by tiie fourth service meeting in March. On Sunday, March 27, after spending one or more hours in house-to-</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">for a 20-percent. increase in April. This increase, of course, should consist of persons that want to serve Cod and that understand what the ministry means. From the approximately 200,000 home Bible studies conducted nationwide, we should be able to find a sufficient number of persons to reach the quota for April of 265,488 publishers. If you think that a person with whom you are studying has made sufflr ient progress to appreciate the ministry, begin now to prepare him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What greater joy could a dedicated Christian have than to take advantage of the opportunities open to him for furthering the reconciliation of persons of good will with God and his perfect government? It is a ministry that means salvation not only for those that listen but for us who share in the ministry. house work, distribution of the invitations will begin. All should be invited before the April 3 public talk. After this the Memorial invitation can still be used for a week. It should not be distributed as we do regular handbills. It should be given to those who are already interested and those we contact in the field service who show unusual interest. It should not be distributed on the streets. Some subscribers may not be reached personally, or some goodwill persons might be contacted best by mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Sunday should be a very convenient day for all to attend the Memorial. Offer to assist those who may be lacking transportation. What a pleasure it will be to come to your place of meeting and see so many who have come obediently to observe the Lord's evening meal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ A Memorial report card is being sent to each congregation with the March Statement. The congregation servant will please see that it is filled out and put in the mail promptly after the Memorial, Sunday. April 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Congregations that attend a circuit assembly on April 3 will hear the regular circuit- assembly public talk by the district servant. These congregations may schedule the special talk “Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom of Heaven” for April 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ So that all who assemble to hear the public talk “Universal Disarmament by the Kingdom, of Heaven” benefit from the same material, the speakers should deliver it from manuscript, as it is found in “The Watchtower” of April 15, pages 232-246. This will require careful preparation so that it is presented in a natural manner.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Be a Teacher of Your Children</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Upon parents Jehovah has placed the obligation to be the teachers of their own children. Properly given, this training equips them to meet the problems of life, prepares them for a productive life in the service of God, and firmly plants their feet in the way of life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A principal means of instruction is by word of mouth. When teaching facts, endeavor to show children the reason why they are so. If you forget, they will usually ask. Their favorite question, it seems, and a good one, is, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Why?</span><span class="font12"> When teaching principles that govern conduct, be sure the child knows what the words mean, can explain the idea in his own words and can give examples of the application of the principle. For example, a child may be taught not to steal, but this means little to one who as yet has no sense of property rights and who is fascinated by everything he sees. Explanation of the rule is needed. Parents who are good teachers know that it takes more than one lesson to teach important matters; they inculcate truths; that is, they employ frequent repetition. It is important, too, to aim your instruction, not only at the mind of the child, but also at the heart. Help him both to know and to love what is right.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As a teacher, train your children in good study habits. With this in mind, it is very important to have regular times set aside to study together. Encourage them to comment in the meetings, but do not make this the only goal of study; seek understanding. Help them to acquire the good habit of meditating on truths learned in order to deepen heart appreciation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Children learn many things more readily by example than they do by precept, though both are important. It is by your example as parents that your children learn proper habits of meeting attendance, field service, good conduct, respect, proper language, and so forth. Verbal instruction is seldom enough; it must be backed up by consistent parental example if it is to take hold. Additionally, children must be helped to avoid bad associations outside the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Discipline ip also part of teaching children, but it must be administered consistently, fairly and out of love if they are to learn the right lesson from it. It should be remembered that, just as punishment discourages wrong conduct, so commendation encourages good behavior. Yes, love moves parents to be patient teachers of their children</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Subscription Expiration Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> subscribers should be called on regularly, though sometimes this is not done. So when expiration slips are received, the congregation servant should see that they are immediately distributed and that calls are promptly made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> On approaching the subscriber it is not good to mention at first that his subscription has expired and that you wish to have him renew it. Approach him in a friendly way as on a back-call, as one you feel is interested in the truth. You might say: “Good morning. I am a representative of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watc,Mower</span><span class="font12"> [or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!]</span><span class="font12"> magazine. [At this point you may be invited inside.] We are interested in all persons who are concerned about conditions today and especially those who believe in God’s Word. In reading </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> [or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.']</span><span class="font12"> no doubt you have increased youi* faith and hope in the Kingdom we have all prayed for. Speaking of prayer, . . Then give the sermon on prayer. On conclusion of the sermon have scriptures or points selected in an article in the current magazine to show them. Then in a positive manner present the subscription. You could say, in a confident way: &quot;I know</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Jehovah from house to house. Make this a full day of praise. In the afternoon or evening have good-will persons accompany you to the Kingdom Hall to hear the special lecture. After the discourse, the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> should be released for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> During the week of April 3, the service meeting will be specially designed to prepare us for the weekend’s ministry. Saturday, April 9, will be a special Magazine Day. Contact points for witnessing should be arranged at convenient times and definite arrangements should be made to aid new ones out in this activity. The articles in the special issues are designed to help all persons to see that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world. The weekly </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study should you have enjoyed having this magazine in the past and would like to have it continue. I have a notice that your subscription has expired. The renewal is only one dollar for a full year. I’ll be happy to renew your subscription for you at this time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> If the person enjoyed the magazine, it is often good to offer the subscriptions for both magazines. If he says he has not read the magazine, you may express regret that he missed many good things, then show him something good from a current issue as above described and suggest he take the magazine again in order to get the real benefits lie missed by not reading it before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes another member of the household answers your call. If the original subscriber is not at home, explain why you called; go ahead in a similar way and offer the subscription. Often the person will subscribe either for himself or for the other member of the family.</span></p>

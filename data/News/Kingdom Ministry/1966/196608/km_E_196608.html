<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST, 1966</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. IX NO. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Those of us who have attended one of the first three conventions are certainly enthusiastic and very grateful to Jehovah God for what he has brought to our attention during the five days of the assembly. Here at Bethel it has been talk, talk, talk about what happened. Expressions such as, “Isn’t that great about Jeremiah!” and, “They certainly made some strong points in the demonstration about Potiphar’s wife,” are often heard. The keynote speech too gave us all something to think about seriously. As one brother put it, “If you miss the first day of this convention, why, you have just missed too much.” If you haven’t attended yet, be sure to be present right from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You will be interested to know that, after the Toronto assembly, CBC carried a half-hour TV program from coast to coast about Jehovah’s witnesses, and lots of people are talking about it It showed the convention in Toronto, the Bethel home and branch office there and how the preaching work is done world wide. This stirred up much interest for the next two assemblies too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We had an excellent public meeting in Toronto. The day was beautiful. While it was warm, that did not keep people away; there were 46,118 present. A few days before that, 483 were baptized. The next week the convention was held in Corner Brook, up there in the beautiful woods of Newfoundland. Daily attendance was about 900 to 1,000. Friday was a holiday, and that evening we had 1,249 at the meeting; they thoroughly enjoyed it. Sunday there were 1,284 for the public meeting. Sixteen were baptized. Following the Corner Brook assembly, brothers from twentyeight states of the U.S. and all parts of Canada showed up in Halifax for the next one. Right from the first day, average attendance was steadily about 3,900, and then for the public meeting we had</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Building One Another Up</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “You mean I should try to build others up? I have never felt that I was supposed to. That’s really the responsibility of the servants, isn’t it?” Is that the way you feel about it? If so, you will want to give close attention to what the apostle Paul says at 1 Thessalonians 5:11: “Therefore keep comforting one another and building one another up, just as you are in fact doing.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Paul addressed this to the entire congregation, not just to the servants. Also, he said that they were already doing it. He simply encouraged them all to keep it up. Yes, the obligation to build up falls on each one of us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How can we do this? By a steady course of faithful endurance and zealous service that sets a fine example, for one thing. We can also build others up by what we say to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Usually, it doesn’t take much extra time. Think of how often we see our brothers at the meetings each week. Some Kingdom</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">4,668. Thirty-three were baptized on Friday morning. Briefly, that is the report given by Brother Knorr when he returned to Bethel for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Knorr attended all three of those assemblies and he expects to go to Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver in Canada, Jehovah willing. He also plans to spend some time with the brothers in Alaska, he told us. And he is going to San Francisco for the first two days of the assembly there, in addition to spending a few days in Miami and Mobile. That is the latest news from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We might mention to those of you planning to attend the San Francisco and Baltimore assemblies, it would be wise to take umbrellas or large hats to use as sun shields, because both of these conventions are in outdoor stadiums and you Halls just buzz with cheerful, theocratic conversation before and after meetings. Sometimes new ones are impressed by this spirit as much as by what they hear from the platform. Many thoughtful publishers make it a point to get acquainted with each one in the congregation, take </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font11"> personal Interest in them and have something encouraging to say each time they meet. One older brother, now limited in his activity, explained to one of the Society’s traveling representatives that he spends a good deal of time thinking of how he can encourage different ones in the congregation. He was doing a fine job of it too.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Family members, too, can build one another up. This also can be done in your normal daily schedule. For example, is the consideration of the text for the day just a routine matter in your home? It need not be. Many have made it just the opposite—a time for a spiritually upbuilding discussion. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">may need some protection from the heat of the sun during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here in Brooklyn in the sweltering heat of summer—it has gotten up above 100 degrees a number of times so far—we are busy as usual. Excavation work Is under way on the new factory site, and we will let you know more about that when the building gets above the ground. We are also as busy as bees getting your literature orders filled. We are certainly happy that you are so busy in the service and we are glad to be able to serve with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with you and may you have as good a time at the assemblies as those of us have had who have already attended one of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our warm love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Keeping Our Minds Fixed on the Things Above. (Col. 3:2) Song 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Introduction, text and comments. Blend all of this in with discussion of branch letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Discussion of “Soul” in “Make Sure,” pages 463-465. May be handled by having a publisher at a new Bible study where clergyman has dropped in to stop the study. Clergyman can bring up subject of soul, perhaps stating we are destroying hope of life in heaven by teaching man does not have a soul. Publisher, using points from “Make Sure,” can show man is a soul, souls die, and how deliverance from death by resurrection is promised for those souls counted worthy. Clergyman leaves, remembering another appointment. Publisher encourages continued study on subject of soul in Chapter 5 of ‘Impossible to Lie’ book. Householder will continue study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: “Building One Another Up.” Questions and answers on article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Short demonstration can also be arranged, showing brother coming home from work tired and worn from dealing with unhappy worldly complainers. Wife, recognizing his condition, lovingly greets him, telling him how happy she is that he is home. Meal will shortly be ready. She mentions that new “Watchtower” came and there is a wonderful article in it. (Use current “Watchtower.”) Briefly they talk about article and how helpful it will be to them. He is anxious to read it himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other settings may be used, if you so desire, to show need of talking on profitable matters to cover local needs. For example, two or three sisters can be talking about another one and the conversation drifts into critical remarks about the sister. Then one recalls the service meeting discussion “Building One Another Up” and they all agree conversation is not upbuilding or profitable. Will remember in future to speak upbuildingly of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If time allows, more than one demonstration may be given, making the points in the article stand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments. “How Did We Do in June?” and congregation’s report for July may also be covered. If some are pioneering, be sure to mention their good work. Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Showing Love by Feeding the Sheep. (John 21:15-17) Song 103.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk, “Handling Family Problems Before They Grow,” based on the August 1, 1966, “Watchtower.” To be handled preferably by a mature brother who has set a fine example in rearing his own family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: Theocratic News, Announcements and “Most Beautiful Music.” Make this part lively and interesting. 23 min: Feeding the Sheep. Demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman: As we are now using the ‘Impossible to Lie’ book for the third consecutive month in the field ministry, many have been placed with interested persons. What is being done to study with them? If you are not yet conducting a study in this publication, you may wish to try starting one. This book is designed to answer questions of persons of various faiths throughout the world. It presents a concise summation of the Bible and highlights important doctrines that distinguish true worship. The people need this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Scene I: Publishers presenting sermon to householder. Householder comments that he thinks it is terrible that so many favor the philosophy that God is dead. Publisher points out that the first chapter of ‘Impossible to Lie’ book powerfully refutes that contention and he will enjoy reading it. In fact, may be interested to know that part of our work is conducting home Bible studies, and would like to demonstrate briefly how we do that, as this service is entirely free. Is invited in and starts study with first paragraph of chapter one. They discuss several paragraphs. Publisher concludes by arranging to continue study. Encourages-person to read ahead, noting particularly interesting points starting with paragraph 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Scene II: After leaving, one publisher says to other that he enjoyed starting right in ‘Impossible to Lie’ book, but he thought that we were supposed to start study in a booklet first. Other publisher points out that it depends on circumstances and what seems best in each case. Often good to study in booklet because it makes many points clear very quickly and person can see difference between what Bible teaches and what false religion teaches. Then, too, it helps us determine more quickly if person is sincerely interested or not. However, in some cases householder has a question that needs more explanation than is found in the booklet, and it is good to switch to the more complete comments in the ‘Impossible to Lie’ book to help overcome the obstacle to progress by clearing up any troublesome point thoroughly. There is certainly no objection to starting right in the book, either on a chapter that holds particular interest for the householder or right at beginning, especially where considerable interest is shown and there is a good possibility of continuing the study. Encourages brother to try it himself. Explains that, even though many people we speak to may believe in God and in the Bible, still material in first three chapters is very important to give them more solid foundation for their faith and reasons why such belief is proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Chairman invites comments from publishers in congregation, especially those having studies in ‘Impossible to Lie’ book, telling how they got study started and what points they have found of particular interest to householder thus far. Concludes by pointing out that this publication has taken place of “Let God Be True” as the book most comprehensively covering true Bible doctrine and that it is important for those progressing in the knowledge of the truth to consider this material. It should be covered before a person is baptized. We do not want to give the people just the milk of the Word, but we want to help them progress in appreciation of the varied spiritual food found in this excellent book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Include mention of slogan on page 4. (Col. 1:10) Song 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Remembering the Creator —As Youths and Parents. (Eccl. 12:1) Song 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Laying a Good Foundation. Brother invites to the platform a number of the young children of the congregation (check with their parents in advance for approval), preferably preteen-age who have studied in the “Paradise” book and asks them simple questions that they may answer. In preparing for this part brother could make up about 40 to 50 questions. Twenty or so of these he can post a week ahead so youngsters will be able to prepare answers. The other questions will not be previously shown to the youngsters, so they will have to answer from the knowledge they have gained from family studies. Brother can emphasize in conclusion the importance of family studies and how they establish basic Bible truths and beliefs in minds of youngsters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Discussion, possibly with overseer and two or three couples, on article “That They May Not Turn Aside.” They will discuss how they may cooperate together in a fine way to help the children stay close to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk, “Making the Most of Our Lives.” Deal with pioneering and other full-time ministerial work, encouraging all the younger publishers particularly to consider pioneer service, Gilead and Bethel. “Yearbook” experiences or local experiences may be used to add interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding announcements. Encourage publishers to support Labor Day field service activity. Song 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Fearlessly Spreading Truth Though It Plagues Men. Song 113.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on month’s theme, “Fearlessly Spreading Truth Though It Plagues Men,” based on July 1, 1965, “Watchtower” and September 1, 1966, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Presenting the Good News. In his brief part chairman should stress how essential it is that we lovingly consider our Catholic neighbors and do our utmost to help them. Now more than ever it seems Catholic people are responding to the Kingdom message. Biggest increases in publishers this year in Catholic countries. (See also February 8, 1966, “Awake!”) If no Catholics in territory, may use time for some other matter needed locally or may approach it from the standpoint of what to do if encountering Catholics in future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Publisher talks to Bible study servant, asking question discussed in Question Box. He reads the answer and explains the point in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Consider local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 7.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That They May Not Turn Aside</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In many congregations there are young folks who have made fine progress in spiritual matters and whose feet are firmly set in the way of the truth, and, yet, in other congregations some have dropped out of the race for life. Recently we asked a few overseers who ' have many fine youngsters in their congregations what they thought accounted for the difference. This is what they told us:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> “Basically, the answer is to be found within the family circle. When the father takes the spiritual oversight of his family, arranging for a practical family schedule, children really benefit. Such balanced schedules include time for attendance at all meetings, field service, relaxation and association with others in the truth. These families are really happy because the father takes a loving Interest in each one, building up a warm bond of love and unity.”—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Another overseer put it this way: “We have a number of sisters whose husbands are opposed or indifferent. We know it isn’t easy for</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ In each congregation an actual count of literature should be taken early in September. We are sending out two Literature Inventory forms with the monthly statement. We would appreciate your filling them out and returning the original to us no later than September 5. You may keep the duplicate in your file. For the next service year a new chart and supply of congregation monthly report cards and magazine distributors’ order blanks are being sent to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The next group of twenty new public talk outlines will soon be mailed to each congregation. These may be scheduled anytime after you complete the present series of twenty and are able to arrange for speakers to deliver them. Six months ago each congregation was requested by the Society to provide speakers for certain ones of the talks in order to get the program going in each circuit. We suggest that those congregations that were assigned talk #1 in the first series take #21 in the new group; those that had #2 before will have #22 now; etc. Of course, if you have more competent public speakers, you may assign them any others of the public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The Society does not send out personal copies of the booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum on Procedure of Jehovah’s Witnesses Under Selective Service</span><span class="font10"> to individuals. Each congregation should have one copy in its file. Those needing it may borrow it from the overseer for a short time, study it, and then return it to him so that it will be accessible to others needing it. The Society has only a limited supply of these booklets, so they should not be ordered unless the congregation has no copy in its files or has many brothers of draft age and so needs an additional copy. If a copy is ordered, please enclose 25c. </span><span class="font11">them to bring up their children theocratically by themselves. Yet many are doing a fine job and their youngsters are holding fast to the truth. These mothers have a regular Bible study with their children. Appreciating the importance of theocratic associations, they encourage these and reasonably limit their children’s associations with others who are not in the truth. By their own good example they instill a love of the truth and theocratic associations in the hearts of their youngsters.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> “In our congregation,” said another overseer, “we let our youngsters know they are wanted and needed. In cooperation with the parents we use them in demonstrations, teach them how to be helpful in cleaning the Kingdom Hall and keeping it neat, and as they grow older, we use them as attendants and assistant servants. Grown-ups in the congregation make it a point to speak to them at meetings, commending them whenever they are on the program or make a comment. We let them</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The literature offer for October will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> with three booklets, for $1. The October 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will be a special issue featuring a subject that perplexes countless millions of persons: “Why Does God Permit Wickedness?” The October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will contain the article “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?” During October we will not be offering bound books but we will be using the entire month to distribute these timely magazines and to obtain subscriptions. Order now so that you will have ample supplies.</span></p>

In this way they have grown up with the truth as a way of life, and we are happy that we have lost none of them.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In general* the Society has observed that, where parents do not take their children for granted but really help them to make the truth their own, they are more apt to stick with it. As one father whose children have grown up to be faithful servants of Jehovah put it: “It’s hard work to bring up children in the truth, in view of the way things are today. My wife and I always tried to set a good example in applying Bible principles in our lives as well as teaching the children to do so. They have been obedient and have always showed respect for us even though at times they may have thought we were a little strict, Today, thanks to Jehovah, they are faithfully serving him.” .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> How can you parents help your children to get a firm hold on the truth? The above thought-provoking suggestions may help, and, when they are able, encourage them to prepare their own talks in the theocratic ministry school. Family spiritual discussions aid them to think and reason on Scriptural matters. You can discuss the importance of obedience to right principles with them and help them to see the folly of pursuing the course this world is taking. In this way they will have not only a “head” knowledge of the truth but a “heart” appreciation of it as well. The spirit of this world with its fads and customs will not be able to overthrow such a well-founded faith. True, there is much to do in fulfilling one’s responsibility as a parent, but the reward comes in seeing that your youngsters have not turned aside from the faith.—Prov. 22 : 6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Very well in placing books and Bibles. We placed 13,114 more than we did in May, or a total of 238,191. This is excellent! What a blessing it will be to those who obtained these as they learn of God’s promise of a righteous new order. Even though many of you were preparing for and attending the assemblies, you still made 1,321,570 back-calls. This is fine. We commend you for taking an interest in others and endeavoring to help them get started on the way to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Assist Our Catholic Neighbors</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> One woman said, “We’ve been tricked.” Another said, “Now that we hear the mass in English, there’s nothing to it.” Others say, “We are supposed to witness to Christ, but we don’t know how.” These are some of the comments heard from Catholic people since the ecumenical council in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What approach might we take so as to assist our Catholic neighbors? If we are certain that it is a Catholic home, we could say, “We have been making friendly visits on our Catholic neighbors to encourage more Bible reading and discussion.” Whatever introduction you use, there are three points that you may wish to Include: (1) our call will take only a few minutes, (2) it is free, and (3) we would like to have the householder use his own Bible. The householder can be invited to get his Bible, and, if there is some hesitation, we might mention the subject we want to discuss. If Revelation 21:3, 4 is used, for example, we could briefly discuss what its fulfillment will mean to the householder. Other appropriate texts from a booklet such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font11"> can be used. After discussing appropriate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Building One Another Up </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">next time you consider the day’s text, why not formulate a comment on it that you believe will do the greatest amount of good in encouraging other members of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Does your family prepare for service together? Think of the opportunities here for building one another up. This month the offer is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book, with a booklet, for 50c. Many families prepare a sermon together and, after experience with it in the field, exchange ideas on just what seems to work best. The same is true with starting studies. Have you experienced the happiness that comes from strengthening .a loved one in this way, not because of obligation, but because of affection?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Is it really worth while going out of your way to build someone up? Yes, indeed. Being with our brothers and having their interests at heart is always worth while. scriptures right from the householder’s own Bible, literature can be offered as an aid to understanding the Bible. If the literature offer is refused, you may still be able to arrange for another call to have a further discussion directly from the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> However we handle such calls, it would be good to make the sermon simple and something that appeals to us as well as being informative and setting out a Scriptural hope. Make plain the purpose of your call so there will be no doubt in the householder’s mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> At the outset some brothers talking to Catholics find it best to state that they are Jehovah’s witnesses and then kindly explain why they are calling. They mention that they are very much interested in their neighbors and that is why they take time to come to their homes to help them with their study of the Bible. Also, you can stress the importance of Bible study because of the seriousness of the times in which we live. Try to end the call on a positive note, even if the householder does not respond to the offer of assistance made. May our plain words of truth appeal to the ears and act on the hearts of those who feel they have been tricked by their church.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Most Beautiful Music”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A letter recently received by the Society from a publisher appreciatively states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Right now I’m in the middle of my housework and my home is filled with the most beautiful music ever I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Our two teen-age daughters have lost all interest in the radio and play the records every chance they get. We didn’t notice No. 10 with the songs from the Bethel family at first, but what a thrill in hearing those beautiful voices!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Now when the friends call on the phone they get to listen to a few notes of beautiful music before we talk. I just had to write you a letter of thanks for all the works of love that went into getting these records to us. This blessing from our Father, Jehovah, draws us closer to him and to our brothers as we serve Jehovah at his House.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font10">• May more than one home Bible study be reported if more than one study is conducted with members of the same family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Circumstances in families vary somewhat, but it is best, wherever possible, to have the entire family together for one study of the Bible. Sometimes misunderstandings arise when a study is started with the wife without the husband’s knowledge. Make every effort to have him participate in the study right from the beginning. Children, too, regardless of age, should be included. The conductor of the study will necessarily have to take into consideration the capacity of each member of the family to grasp the material being studied and direct the study in such a way that each member progresses to maximum understanding. Studying together draws the family closer and between studies they will be able to discuss the things learned for further enrichment. Parents can be encouraged from the beginning to discuss the Bible with their children and help them to prepare for their family study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are times when circumstances may prevent all members of a family from being together at one time. The husband may work nights and thus not be able to attend a study when other members of the family are together. Also, there are cases where one marriage mate may have started studying sometime before the other. In order to catch up, a separate study may be necessary for a short while. In these and similar situations, it would be allowable for the publisher or publishers conducting the two studies within one family to report both and count the time spent conducting them. (Clarifying information on reporting family studies conducted by parents appears in the February 1964 ‘‘Kingdom Ministry,&quot; page 5, paragraphs 22 and 23.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </span><span class="font1">OCTOBER, 1966 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. IX NO. 10</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">^PuMiske/ts:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">All of us who attended one of the “Gods Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies this past summer were given much to think about, weren’t we? The talks and the dramas made us feel the urgency of the times and the need of walking circumspectly before Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The young people, too, have a lot to think about. Where are they going to expend their energies? Young men who are dedicated to God can offer to serve Jehovah at Bethel. There is also the missionary service, preceded by special training at Gilead. The Society is doing everything possible right now to open up foreign fields and get the Kingdom message preached. The work is urgent, and here at Bethel we feel that urgency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On September 11, 106 who share that feeling graduated from the 42d Class of Gilead, and now many are already on their way to their assignments. The auditorium was packed out for the graduation program. Hundreds of servants and their wives specially invited by the Society from congregations near<sup>-</sup> New York were glad to be present, along with others. The program emphasized the responsibility of each one to give free to others the truth that he has received free. It highlighted the fact that people everywhere desperately need something they can really believe in, and we have it for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the afternoon Brother Knorr showed interesting pictures about the missionary work world wide, and there was a fine musical program. Also, the students put on a fascinating Bible drama, showing how the Mosaic law was administered and what the principles embodied in that law mean to us today. It reminded us of the conventions this past summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now another month is here and the opportunity to use it well to honor Jehovah. May we all share fully in the work that Is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your loving brothers, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Share in Vindicating Our God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> While in the field ministry, you have no doubt often been confronted with the challenge, “If there is a God, why does he permit all this sorrow, suffering and wickedness?” By misleading mankind on this matter, Satan has caused much reproach to be east upon the name of our God, as we well know. It is our privilege to share in clearing away the reproach by making known the truth and, at the same time, comforting those who love righteousness. In a clear, understandable way the special October 8 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> presents the facts. The theme of the entire magazine, “Why Does God Permit Wickedness?”, surely is timely, isn’t it? What </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a privilege</span><span class="font12"> it will be </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font12"> all of us to have a part in sharing it with others!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During the entire month of October, as we distribute this special issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, we</span><span class="font12"> are going to urge people to subscribe for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine for a full year. We know from our own experience that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> gives insight into the meaning of current affairs and it contains sound counsel for meeting the problems of everyday life. We also enjoy its articles on science, the marvels of creation and the way of life of people in many parts of the earth. And we know that when </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> covers these fields of information it presents facts and highlights viewpoints that other publications do not, isn’t that so? This is so because it does not compromise the truth and because it always takes into account the principles and prophecies of God’s Word the Bible. Furthermore, when a householder receives and reads </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> regularly he is kept aware of the vital fact that God has promised to bring in a righteous new order in this generation. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> often appeals to persons who are not inclined to accept our other publications. They like its broader coverage; so It is an effective means of reaching these people with the Kingdom message. Also, for those, who do read </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!</span><span class="font12"> serves a valuable purpose in aiding them to see how Christian principles should affect one’s view on all the various matters of life. So, during October let’s enthusiastically encourage everyone who will to subscribe for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In addition to obtaining subscriptions, we can have a share in vindicating our God by offering individual copies of the special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> with its Scriptural answer to the question, Why does God permit wickedness?, and the October 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> which answers the question, What has God’s kingdom been doing since 1914? This is something that we all can do. If people are too busy to listen to your sermon, at least offer the individual magazines. If they do listen to the sermon but do not want to subscribe, certainly encourage them to accept the special issue. Then, too, there is regular magazine work that can be done, whether from house to house, store to store or on the streets, and just getting these magazines into the hands of the people may open the way for them to learn the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Who else is there with whom you could share this message contained in the special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span><span class="font12"> Do you have a relative to whom you have tried to witness? It may be that you will want to send him a copy. Are there certain neighbors, deliverymen or shopkeepers to whom you have talked about the Bible? Many of them would appreciate a satisfying answer to the questions, Why does God permit wickedness? and, How much longer will it be? Let them have the opportunity to get the answers; offer them the magazine. It may get them started on the way to life. Let’s keep on using these magazines just as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Theme: Meetings to Equip Us for the Ministry. Song 99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Question Box. Include audience participation and comments on application of points to congregation. Emphasize importance of being at the meetings to be effective ministers. 12 min: “Our Public Meetings.” This can be a discussion between two public speakers, particularly analyzing paragraphs 4, 5.

<p><span class="font10">25 min: Using “Awake!” to Start Home Bible Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Encourage all to make return visits on those who obtained special issue of “Awake!” Placement of magazine can do much good, but more good can be done if we keep a record and follow through to aid householders to gain accurate knowledge of the truth. The first issue of “Awake!” each month is now designed to aid you to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Servant discusses matter with publisher who wants help to start Bible study. Direct attention to article “Why, Then, Does God Permit Wickedness?” Point out that study questions at end of article correspond with paragraphs; one question for each paragraph. Bible quoted in article is often the one householder will have. Publisher asks how to start off return call, what to say. Servant suggests: remind householder of earlier call, ask if he read magazine. If answer is, ‘No, I have been too busy,’ as often is the case, you can say: ‘That is exactly why I called to see you again. I know you are busy, but I realized that you were interested in that subject discussed in the magazine.’ With that, turn to the study article and read first paragraph. If it arouses a spark of interest, consider next few paragraphs and refer to the Bible. Publisher asks how to handle it if householder has already read magazine. Servant suggests saying: ‘That’s fine. .No doubt you enjoyed it as I did. I particularly enjoyed this last article. Notice what it says.’ Then start reading that first paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Demonstrate call on magazine placement. Householder says he did not read. Use suggestion above. After first paragraph, no interest shown, householder says he has no time. Conclude call pleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstrate another call. Householder here, too, says he did not read magazine. Use same approach. When first paragraph is read, householder responds. Go on to next paragraph. When article refers to Bible, stop and encourage householder to get his. He does, and invites publisher in. Discussion continues to extent time permits. Use Bible. After reading paragraph, if you want to ask the corresponding question at the end of the article, fine. Use your own discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Servant emphasizes how easy this arrangement is. At conclusion of call, arrange to call back. When you finish the article, you might say: ‘It is interesting how much we have learned in such a short time. But; this is just one of the precious truths in the Bible. There is more concerning God himself, his purpose for the earth and those of us upon it, and the hope for the dead. We need to know these things. I would be glad to spend some time each week assisting you to learn what the Bible says. We will use your Bible, and the arrangement is absolutely free of charge.’ Then arrange to go into the “Good News” booklet, the ‘Impossible to Lie’ book or another study article in “Awake!” 10 min: Concluding comments. Include an experience or two from a local publisher telling how he learned the truth by means of a home Bible study. Song 82.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Youths, Parents and the Christian Congregation.” Talk, preferably by one of the- congregation committee, on article in September 15, 1966, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min:,Discuss and demonstrate suggested sermon for November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Life Everlasting in a Better System of Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ps. 37:10, 11—Wicked to be destroyed, righteous preserved into peaceful new system of things</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ps. 37:27—Must turn away from bad, learn and do what is good</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ps. 37:34—Those hoping in Jehovah will see end of wickedness shortly Suggested introduction and transitions: ‘We are living in a system of things where there is much wickedness. Honest-hearted (peace-loving) persons wonder if God is forever going to tolerate wickedness and evildoers. What do you think? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says at Ps. 37:10, 11. [Read and emphasize promise that wicked will soon be no more, and righteous will be blessed with life everlasting in peace on this earth.] Would you like to live forever in a world with no wars, sickness, sorrow or death? [Allow for response.] Well, the Bible tells us how we can be part of such a peaceful world. At Psalm 37:27 we are promised: [Read and make point that we not only must turn from bad but also must do good; must study Bible to learn what God requires.] In this same book of the Bible, in verse 34, we are told: [Read and stress again need to study Bible in order to know and keep Jehovah’s way; then we will actually see end of wickedness.] We have the unique privilege of living at the time when these promises will be fulfilled. This book “Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God” contains an interesting chart on pages 31-35 showing that this present system of things does not have many more years left. [Be careful not to make any predictions about when certain events are going to occur.] I would like to encourage you to check into this Bible chronology and other fine points in this pible publication. The book along with a booklet is left for just 50 cents.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After discussing and demonstrating sermon, chairman can comment on following points: At outset it would be good in some cases to invite householder to get his Bible. Encourage householder to express self. Endeavor to start a study on the first call, if circumstances make that possible; may use new book or a booklet. In giving sermon we should not make any predictions about Armageddon’s coming in a certain year; let them read the chapter and see what the evidence indicates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Ask for experiences had in starting studies with “Awake!” Song 116.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Public Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It has been heartwarming to receive the letters that many of yon have sent to the Society expressing appreciation for the new publicmeeting arrangement. As one said : “The topics and teaching methods employed are helping those in the congregation as well as the newer ones really to learn the points dealt with. They have proved to be a fine stimulus for even those living some distance away to attend each talk.” Another wrote: “Our attendance has increased about 20 percent since we started the new series.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now there are twenty more new talks available for you to use, and in October you will no doubt be hearing some of them. Each one provides a real spiritual feast and practical counsel that we all need. Don’t miss any of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Though the name of the speaker usually means little to the public, and so is^not printed on the handbill, the 'publishers are often acquainted with the speakers and appreciate it when they are told in advance who is to give their public talk. If you prefer, this can simply be posted on the information board for each month. Also, it stimulates interest in the talks when the congregation is told in advance, not only the title of the talk, but something else about it to whet the appetite. Why not try it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If you have the privilege of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Share in Vindicating Our God </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">long as they last, and if you want more, we will be glad to send them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Keep in mind, too, that the placement of each copy of this special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> can be a step toward a home Bible study. The last article in the magazine has been specially designed for that. Entitled “Why, Then, Does God Permit Wickedness?”, it presents the answer in a simple, satisfying way. The article is really a condensation of the entire magazine, each paragraph setting out key thoughts from the preceding articles. At the end of this article are numbered questions that correspond to the paragraphs, and these are for your use in conducting home Bible studies. Having in mind that this magazine is designed for starting studies, by all means keep a record of those who obtain it and call again. Take a personal interest in aiding them to learn the truthful answer to the question, Why does God permit wickedness? In that way let’s all share in vindicating Jehovah our God and in blessing those who respond to his loving provisions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">giving a public talk, by all means make it your best. Though the outline is extensive, do not just read it to the audience. Careful preparation is required to do a good job. Get a clear grasp of each one of the main points and then speak with earnestness, from an overflowing heart. Remember, enthusiasm is the life of a talk! In delivering your talk, keep in mind, too, that you have fifty-five minutes to teach your audience something of lasting benefit. The job is not accomplished simply by covering the material. You need to use local illustrations, reasoning, repetition and oral emphasis to fix the points in the minds of those in your audience. If you cannot cover everything that is on the outline and still do really effective teaching, then feel free to skip portions. It is not how much you say that counts; it is how much the audience remembers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Where speakers have followed through on the suggestions given concerning the use of the blackboard. illustrations, reviews, and so forth, this has added greatly to the enjoyment on the part of the audience. Others have taken the initiative in using other teaching methods, too, and with good results. Give careful thought to this matter in preparing your talks, because it will make your presentation more lively and interesting and will help to impress on the minds of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting the Special “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Having an appealing presentation is a big factor in placing magazines. In offering the October 8 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> you may want to use one of these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I am making calls because people are concerned about the wicked conditions that we see all around us. Possibly you have asked, as others have, ‘Why Does God Permit Wickedness?’ [At this point, take out magazines.] That question is answered in this special issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> You may have it, with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> for 10c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another suggestion: “We are calling because we believe that you are concerned about the increase of violence, even as we are. Many sincere persons are well aware of the fact that God is not responsible for this wickedness. But they ask, How much longer will he tolerate it? [Take out magazines and open to article.] That question is answered in this article, ‘How Much Longer Will It Be?’ This copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is yours, with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> for 10c.” your audience in a more lasting way the material that is presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■s All of us enjoy these public talks, and we are looking forward to a most beneficial series of meetings in the months to come.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With Well-Planned Arrangements for Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In a discussion among some of the servants here at the Brooklyn branch office a short time ago, it was mentioned that sometimes publishers and study conductors alike become discouraged because they cannot support all the meetings for field service. Do you feel that way at times? Well, perhaps the problem is that we need to keep those meetings in proper perspective. They are meant to be an aid to us, not a burden.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Some of you brothers can be out in the service every day, and that is a marvelous blessing. Others of you may get out in the field ministry just once or twice a week. But not every publisher can be at every meeting for field service, can he? Of course, when you do go out, if it is convenient for you to work with a group, it is usually mutually upbuilding. On the other hand, there are times when you may find that it is advantageous to work alone, and it is quite all right to do that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our book study conductors endeavor to arrange things conveniently for us, and we appreciate that. From time to time they may want to talk to all of us in their service groups to see just what time we have available that we would like to use for group witnessing, and perhaps some of us can adjust our schedules to coincide with those of others in order to help them. If some of us can share in prestudy service or other evening activity, from house to house, making back-calls or conducting studies, our study conductor will be glad to arrange for that. If some can go out on weekdays, arrangements will also be made for that, even though not everyone can go then. So, too, some may be able to go out on weekends, while that may not be possible for others. The point is that these meetings for service are arranged for our convenience; they are not arbitrarily selected times at which everyone is expected to meet for service. The study conductor himself may not be able to be on hand for every meeting for service, though he certainly will be taking a zealous lead in the ministry. He may ask someone else to care for the service group when necessary. But if the one in charge of a service group finds that he is often the only one at the meeting for service, then perhaps other arrangements need to be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is good to be flexible in matters such as these. Sometimes where there are only a few who can share in Saturday-morning magazine activity or Sunday activity, for example, it may be advisable for the overseer to combine several groups, if this does not make it inconvenient as far as travel is concerned. A congregation that has ten service centers, for example, may want to have just three meetings for service on Saturday morning and then possibly some meetings for service at the same places or other locations in the afternoon. Even where such arrangements have not been made, a publisher who would like to work with a group may find it necessary to go to a meeting for service at another service center on a certain day, and that is all right. But do not forget the importance of following up interest that is located.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As we arrange our field service, either Individually or as groups, let’s keep in mind that the important thing is to have a full share in preaching the Kingdom good news and making disciples. In the short remaining time, let’s work at it with urgency!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN AUGUST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A nice conclusion to our year’s report! Yes, it was very fine to see 302,317 publishers, an increase of 4,430 over last August. Especially was the report good considering that August was district assembly month for the U.S.A., with assemblies at San Francisco, Dallas, Newark, Baltimore, Miami Beach and Mobile. Even with many publishers in the country attending an assembly, the field service activity was well supported.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font10">• Is there a set time at which all congregations ought to have their meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No, there is no rule. The important thing is to arrange for them at times convenient for the majority of the publishers. That can mean that both the times and the days when meetings are held may vary from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In some places more than one congregation uses the same hall, as you know, and meeting times need to be set accordingly. In congregations where most of the brothers are dairy farmers it may be wise to adjust the meeting time to make it possible for those with farm chores to get their work done and still be at the meetings. Congregations with many children of school age sometimes find that attendance at the service meeting and theocratic ministry school is better on an evening that is not followed by a school d$,y. We even know of an instance in which quite a number of sisters whose husbands were unbelievers found that they could not get to the congregation book study in the evening, and so arrangements were made for them to have a meeting during the day. The important, thing is that we do not forsake the gathering of ourselves for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most publishers prefer to do their field ministry early on Sunday, and then gather for congregation meetings in the afternoon or evening. But certain congregations have found that, because of the way of life; in their locality, they get a more favorable response in the field ministry on Sunday afternoon than in the morning, so they have their meetings in the morning. Either is all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, in setting meeting times, we suggest that you consider these points: (1) Are the meetings at times convenient for most of the publishers and other interested persons? (2) How will the times of the meetings affect the field ministry of the congregation?</span></p>

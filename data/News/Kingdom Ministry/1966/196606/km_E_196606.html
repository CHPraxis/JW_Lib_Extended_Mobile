</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have been asking ourselves, “What will the results in the U.S.A, be for April?” Now the final figures are in, and we rejoice because such a fine witness was given and you worked hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">First, look at the hours. Excellent! There were 5,263,371 hours spent preaching. Bible studies conducted, one-quarter of a million! To be exact, there were 258,569 Bible studies, a new peak for the U.S. Your magazine distribution, 7,191,379 copies. Additionally, you obtained, 148,280 new subscriptions. The report is fine and all Kingdom publishers have reason to be glad. But now we have another question. Did we lose some sheep in April? A year ago we had 327,588 publishers in the field. But this year we had 318,559. We are wondering why, and we guess you are too. This is serious, isn’t it? Did your congregation have fewer sheep in April than last year? How many? How did it happen that we had 9,029 fewer publishers in April? True, this is our best month in publishers so far this year, but why did we not have as many as in 1965? Really, we had </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> whole year, twelve months, to help mature those publishers who worked with us last year. Did we get these publishers to the meetings regularly during the year and help them mature? Did we continue to show interest in them and have studies with them ? Did we try to take them in the field service with us during the past twelve months? Why did some of those persons discontinue publishing? Who were they? Teenagers? Children? Grown-ups? Baptized ones ? It makes us think, doesn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is easy to say, “It is the trend of materialism, you know,” and to let it go at that. It could be. But we would rather look at it from this point of view. Have we, Jehovah’s witnesses, done everything possible to help our brothers who once shared this glorious treasure of service to fully appreciate it?</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We Have What They Need</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> No doubt you have observed, as we have here in Brooklyn, that perhaps the majority of homes have a Bible. Yet we know that merely having a Bible has not given people accurate knowledge of God’s purposes. Haven’t you also discovered that even those who have done some Bible reading often admit that they have difficulty in understanding it? Of course, we know that the archaic language is one of the problems. Yet we are aware that their lives depend on understanding and applying God’s- Word. So when we call at the homes of the people with the New </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation</span><span class="font11"> we can have confidence that what we are offering is what they really need. And if they will listen for just a few minutes, any one of us can show them that it is a Bible that is a delight to read, can’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But in addition to that, people need help to understand the full significance of what the Bible says. Again, Jehovah has provided us with just what people need in order to be guided aright—the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book! We’ve all enjoyed reading the book and discussing it together at the congregation book study, and we realize that it is just what people need if they are going to come to an accurate knowledge</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Where are these lost sheep, 9,029 of them? Have we neglected something during the year? Maybe we were so busy with our own Kingdom interests that we failed to look around and help some of our brothers who were in need. We have a responsibility toward them to help them, maybe even find them again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They are nearby because they attended the Memorial. There were 558,494 in attendance with us, 22,763 more than during the previous year. That is wonderful. There were 5,016 partakers of the emblems, 107 fewer than during 1965; but, then, we expected the number of the remnant to decrease. Interested people are of the truth. So when we offer these two publications—the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book, and two booklets, for $1.50—we can be confident that this is what people need. '</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Realizing what people need, haven’t you often used the scripture at John 17:3 in your ministry, stressing the householder’s need to take in life-giving knowledge of God and his Son? And here in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book we have just that! A whole chapter on the true God and another on his Son!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Something else that all of us have found that deeply concerns honest-hearted persons is this : Why does God allow wickedness? Many have become agnostics because they stumbled over this issue. Others may profess to have faith, but it is weak. What can we do to help them? Offer them the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book; chapter 15 answers their question, and satisfactorily.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Some other people that we would like to help are difficult to reach for a different reason—they are seldom at home when we call. Here again we have something to fill the need! The Society has printed 16,000,000 folders advertising the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font11"> 3) associating with us, because at the special public meeting we had 326,263, an increase of 9,483 ovei- the previous year. That’s good! But the question is, Where is that one sheep, or two, that strayed from the ninety-nine? Do you think we can find him?—Matt. 18:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah bless all of us as we make it our business to find the lost sheep, feed them, cherish them and help them get back into the fold, there to enjoy the fellowship of God’s flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah bless all of you in your happy, interesting work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Sharing Our Spiritual Plenty with Others. Song 65.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include some reference to Isaiah 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “We Have What They Need,” also “For Use on Bible Studies.” Questions and answers; perhaps a short demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Branch letter. Discuss with congregation as a whole or in an appropriate demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Plan for an Upbuilding Summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: School is out or soon will be in most localities, and youths in the congregation are looking forward to an enjoyable summer. With planning, it can also be upbuilding. What are you and your family planning to do in the next few months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Mature brother, preferably one with a family, discusses with two other parents his plans for himself and his family for the summer. Highlight attending the assembly. Comment on any plans for enlarged field service, which may include vacation pioneering for some of the family, or at least more service for the children under the supervision of the parents. Brother asks what the other parents are planning for the summer months. Perhaps they have not given the matter much thought. May have in mind going to the assembly, but had not really planned anything definite as to added service activity. Brother comments that summer goes by fast. Advance planning helps us to get done the things we want to; otherwise we find that the summer is gone and we never did get them done. Parents agree that added theocratic activity would make the summer especially enjoyable and upbuilding; they plan to discuss prospects as a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(6 min.) At mealtime the next day father, mother and children discuss prospects for summer. Father asks children what they are planning to do. One says he is looking forward to assembly, relaxing, sports, etc. Other child agrees. Mother says that it would be fine if they could plan some of their outdoor recreation together while the weather is nice; others like the idea. Father suggests that the children might enjoy having an increased share in field service, and perhaps they can arrange so the family can do it together. Children would enjoy that. Mother says that she could plan to take some time several days a week to work along with them in service during the day. Father comments on when he can be with them. If anyone in the family can plan some time to vacation pioneer, by all means include that. All delighted with prospects; something to look forward to when plans are made in advance. (Make the demonstration true to life.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman encourages families to work together as much as possible during the summer. Point out the blessings of vacation pioneer service, whether for two weeks, a month, two months or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">2 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include appropriate Announcements, “How Did We Do in April?” and “Assemblies Start This Month.” Song 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Helping All to Keep “a Firm Hold” on Life. (1 Tim. 6:19) Song 66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk based on article “Time Is Running Out!” in June 1, 1966, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Servant discusses with undedicated publisher questions that that one has about dedication and baptism. Draw material from “Make Sure,” pages 39-42, 150-153.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Presenting the Good News —“Getting a Hearing Ear.” Talk and demonstration of main points. Make it applicable to local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Local experiences with current offer may be tied in with items from Theocratic News. Remind brothers to bring “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity” booklet next week. Paragraphs 1 to 4 will be covered. Song 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Making the Truth Available to All. Song 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Magazine Distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) After magazine-territory servant starts talking about ‘street witnessing’ a brother raises his hand and, on being acknowledged, says, “Are we still supposed to do street witnessing? I hardly ever see anyone doing it except at assemblies. Usually we go from house to house.” Servant shows it is good to go where we can meet people and accomplish most good. All features of service are good. Scripturally based street witnessing is not out-of-date. (Prov. 1:20, 21; Acts 20:20. For further information see “The Watchtower,” issue of November 1, 1957, page 668, paragraphs 11 and 12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Where and when is street work advantageous? Some publishers and pioneers enjoy excellent results in magazine activity early in the morning before it is wise to witness from house to house, or at times when persons are leaving for work or are coming home. In areas where there are people living in hotels or inaccessible apartment houses publishers often do more street witnessing than they would in other areas, because this is about the only way that many of these people can be contacted with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As with any magazine activity, it is well to be familiar with contents of issues you offer and it is usually good to highlight one point or article in a magazine. Since persons on the street are usually in a hurry, it is important to keep that in mind when approaching them and make your presentation brief. How can this work be done? The most successful way is to approach persons waiting for others in automobiles along the street or in parking lots at shopping centers, those waiting . at the bus stop or train station, persons leaving or entering large factories or other buildings, people walking down the street, etc. Why not share in street witnessing yourself? (See “Qualified to Be Ministers,” Study 46, page 185.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Demonstrate some ways that it would be appropriate in your territory to do street witnessing. Magazine-territory servant may call on various publishers he has asked to prepare presentations. As much as possible use publishers who really do that type of work. Before or after each demonstration, it may be helpful to explain pertinent points regarding the approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman encourages all to share in street witnessing as opportunity affords. When offering magazines, always be kind, respectful and polite, never insistent. Street witnessing can be done at any convenient time, morning, afternoon or evening, and usually in any public area or place, as long as one does not block the door or disturb others, allowing the passersby free access to the street. 15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of paragraphs 1 to 4 of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.” Remind brothers to bring booklet next week (unless you have a fifth meeting in June) and study paragraphs 5 to 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Question Box. Person now associating with congregation asks a servant if he should send a letter of resignation to church with which he was previously affiliated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Comment on article entitled “Is It Up-to-Date?” Include suggestions on places and means for magazine distribution locally. Song 89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This can be prepared by overseer. Consider carefully needs of the congregation and arrange for interesting, beneficial program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Maintaining Worship at “the House of Our God.” (Rev. 7:15) Song 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on theme for month, “Maintaining Worship at ‘the House of Our God.’ ” See “The Watchtower” of July 1, 1966, and December 15, 1965. 15 min: “Carrying the Load Well.” Overseer (if possible) discusses points with congregation book study conductor who has difficulty getting everything done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of paragraphs 5 to 9 of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.” Read and comment on scriptures as time is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Literature offer for July. Encourage any who can to share in witnessing activities on the fourth of July. Song 119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We Have What They Need </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">explaining the free home Bible study service that we offer. So even when people are not at home, we can slip this attractive folder under the door, and this may stimulate them to obtain what they need. Have you obtained your personal supply? Be sure to use them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We have all come to realize that there has never been a time when more people needed to learn God’s will before it is too late. Our work is urgent! We have what they need. It is a privilege for all of us to share in taking it to them.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Carrying the Load Well</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “How do you get everything done?” is the question that is often in the minds of assistant servants reaching out for the office of overseer, especially so when they see all the work the congregation servant has to do. (1 Tim. 3:1) His duties are certainly many, aren’t they? However, week after week a capable overseer endeavors to care for these responsibilities so that the congregation will operate smoothly. It is apparent that he must take care of small matters as well as big ones day after day. But how does he find the time, and how does he remember all the things he must do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many capable overseers keep a checklist to help them. Do you? Some may use a notebook, others a small diary, desk pad or a calendar, writing down things to be accomplished at certain times and checking them off when finished. It saves time, organizes their work and serves as a constant reminder. Their checklist for the coming month is made out as soon as they receive their </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> and have read it over. The publishers also reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> know what‘should be done and, when they see their overseer progressively carrying out his work, they develop even greater respect for him as one who can be depended upon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To see the work involved, look</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Assemblies Start This Month</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Yes, the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly opens at Toronto June 22 through 26. Will you be there? Evidently a great crowd will be, and what a spiritually upbuilding five days they will have together !</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Incidentally, if you are going to one of the Canadian assemblies you may want to keep in mind that the U.S. dollar is worth approximately $1.08 in Canadian funds. However, if you do not want to, it is not necessary to convert U.S. funds into Canadian currency, as American money is readily accepted anywhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Rooming work will also be starting in other cities during June. In San Francisco and Dallas the brothers will begin to sign up rooms on June 12, and on June 19 in Baltimore. So, your brothers are getting ready for you. They are anxious for you to be with them for the full five days of the assembly. And you will be glad if you make arrangements to do just that. The program is just what we need, and it is one that we will all long remember. through this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> and put down all the things you would have to do if you were overseer. For June you would need to assign meeting parts, plan for rehearsals so that the brothers will gain the most good from the meetings, and meet with the school servant. Did your list cover all these points? Local congregation events and the individual spiritual needs of publishers will make the list even longer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Can the overseer carry all this load by himself? No, it is apparent that he needs help. Whether you are a servant in the congregation or</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Announcements</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Literature offer for July and August: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font9"> and a booklet for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It is suggested that a half hour on the service meeting following the week most of the congregation attend the district assembly be used to review assembly highlights. Encouraging experiences may be included. Overseers will want to plan this in advance, making whatever adjustments are necessary in the service meeting schedule. ♦ Those who wish to share the joys of vacation pioneering for two weeks, a month or more this summer are encouraged to get an application and fill it out right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Congregations may find it advantageous to arrange for group witnessing on the fourth of July, since that is a holiday for many persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Suggested meetings for field service: June 12: Deal with common objection encountered when making the offer. June 19: Suggestions for ‘getting a hearing ear.’ (See Presenting the Good News.) June 26: How studies can be started. July 3: Review current sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Starting July 3, circuit servants will give the public talk “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Has Failed?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ Overseer and school servant will meet early in June to discuss the congregation’s ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ When ordering bumper signs for conventioners, please be sure to indicate the assembly city for which they are desired. If you have not yet ordered bumper signs and lapel cards, now is a good time to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Pioneers may obtain songbooks at half the publisher rate. Records are available to pioneers for their personal use at 50c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ When the new records are used to accompany congregation singing, at least at the beginning it may be wise to remind the brothers not to sing during the introduction or during the interlude before the final verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ New publications available:</span></p>

For example, the assistant congregation servant can advise the overseer of trends that need attention in the congregation. Study conductors have certain things that need attention at their service centers and they can call these to the overseer’s attention as well as making personal calls on publishers who need assistance. Publishers, by cooperating with the overseer in every way, just getting their field service reports in on time, helping to keep the Kingdom Hall clean, and supporting arrangements for field service, are a great aid. If all cooperate together, the overseer can carry his load more effectively and efficiently, and that with benefit to the entire congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• Before becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is it necessary to request that one’s name be removed from the membership roll of his former religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Generally speaking, what does coming out of Babylon the Great mean? Straddling the fence and keeping a nominal membership in a Babylonish religious system and at the same time desiring to be listed in the files of a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses? What does Revelation 3:15, 16 say? When a person approaches Jehovah to make a dedication, is He pleased to accept such one and at the same time let him list himself as a member and supporter of Babylon the Great? Where, definitely, does one stand? Or is one indifferent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One’s serving personal notice on Babylon the Great furnishes, an opportunity for a witness. If a Christian writes his former church, this should be done with dignity, briefly stating why he is becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses. One may wish to enclose an appropriate magazine, booklet or tract, such as “What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In some lands failure to remove one’s name from the membership roll of a false religious organization means that part of one’s tax money will continue to go to that church. That, of course, would not be desirable; so, in such a case, diligent effort ought to be made to get one’s name removed from the church register.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a person withdrew from Babylonish religion many years ago, he does not need to be disturbed if he did not make a formal withdrawal from the church with which he was associated. The fact that, perhaps in childhood, one’s name was entered on the membership rolls of a church has no bearing on his present course; nor does it make his dedication invalid. What is it that actually makes one a member of a Babylonish religion? It includes attending church services, engaging in church social or recreational functions and contributing to the church. By ceasing to attend, participate, share in false worship and contribute, it should be clear to the church organization and observers in general that one is no longer a member, whether an actual letter of withdrawal was submitted or not. With an individual’s ties to a false religious organization cut, he may share in the Christian ministry and make a valid dedication to Jehovah God, if otherwise qualified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting a Hearing Ear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Are you finding it difficult to get people to listen to you in the ministry? Many of us are having this difficulty, at least in some of our territories. But why? Is it because people are deciding they do not want the Kingdom good news? In some cases this is no doubt the reason. Yet in others it is not, especially when other publishers can go into the same territory and have good success. Well, how is it that they get a hearing ear? You will no doubt find that a number of things are involved.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For instance: Have you observed that children, even though their presentations are very simple, can often hold the undivided attention of adults? Perhaps you have noticed that foreign-speaking publishers and new publishers often get a hearing ear where others do not usually succeed.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> You will be interested to know that we already have the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font11"> printed in nine languages—Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish—and more are on the way. These are tongues that are spoken by 833 million of earth’s inhabitants, and it is wonderful to realize that we are equipped to use this fine study aid to help any of them to learn the truth from God’s Word. We would like to do more than place the book with them ; what we really want is to have a regular home Bible study with them.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> .Our brothers have found this book ideal for the purpose. It comes to grips with the thinking that is sentation around the things that are of greatest concern to them, and keep it simple.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Men, too, are often more interested in local events and problems than they are in those of other countries. A man’s job, his family and their safety are of Immediate concern to him. Young people are interested in their future; older people, in their security and better health. But no matter what people are interested in, it soon becomes apparent to them that they cannot remedy all the difficulties they face. It will take someone more capable than man. Their hope lies in the Kingdom.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jesus said that the good news of the Kingdom is the message we are to carry to all in our territory during this “time of the end.” If we feature the Kingdom theme, we will be able to keep things simple. Also, you will find it easy to' make personal application of information concerning God’s kingdom. Help the householder to see himself being benefited by the Kingdom. If our presentations are simple, warm and fit the individual’s needs personally, it may be all of us will be able to reach the ears and hearts of more people in oui- territory. In this way we will be able to aid more people by our presentation of the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

Of course, at times we meet a person who is particularly interested in a certain subject, and we need to be flexible. It may be necessary to start studying the chapter that specially interests that householder. But when the study is well established, it would be good to go back and cover the earlier part of the book too. The important thing is to help interested persons to study on a regular basis; and Jehovah, through his organization, has provided us with a fine instrument to accomplish it.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Not long ago two Witnesses on vacation in Connecticut inquired in the town where they were staying as to the location of the Kingdom Hall. Without hesitation the shopkeeper told them where it was, near the edge of town. They drove out to the hall and stopped to read the sign in front to make sure of meeting times, so they could plan to be there. It did not appear that any of the brothers were at the hall just then, so the visitors started to drive away. But as they did, a brother came from behind the hall, curious to see who had stopped. The visiting Witnesses were glad to meet him, and told him that they were looking forward to being at the meeting there Friday evening. “Our meetings have not been on Friday for quite a while,” he said. “We meet on Thursday.” It was a good thing that the visitors met him, because, if they had followed the sign, they would have missed the meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In another location, in Pennsylvania, a Witness whose husband is not in the truth located a Kingdom Hall and checked the sign in front to be sure about meeting times. She worked hard to get the children ready and, with her husband’s permission, left for the hall —just in time for the concluding song. Meeting times had changed, but not the sign.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What about the sign that shows meeting times at your Kingdom Hall? Is it up-to-date?</span></p></li></ul>

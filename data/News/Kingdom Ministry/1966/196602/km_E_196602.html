<p><span class="font10">There is more news to add to what we wrote you in December about the Latin-American tours and Brother Knorr’s visit to that part of the world. Everywhere Brother Knorr has gone up to date he has found tremendous enthusiasm among local publishers and missionaries and in the branch offices. The brothers are all looking forward to greeting their visitors in December and January, and they hope even more will be able to visit them than have decided to go up to now. The local brothers are prepared to make arrangements for hotel accommodations and other things necessary for their brothers to enjoy a good visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been possible to find stadiums, auditoriums and meeting places of various kinds for the assemblies that will be held, and many arrangements have been worked out so the visitors will have an enjoyable time, including some share in the Kingdom service and an opportunity to see what the living conditions are like. Brother Knorr’s visits are brief, but in some places there were opportunities to speak to the local brothers. In Guatemala City 510 attended the talk given by Brothei<sup>-</sup> Knorr and 294 in Managua, Nicaragua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been a great pleasure to receive numerous letters from brothers in the United States expressing appreciation for the Saturday night program presented at the last series of circuit assemblies. Beginning in February there will be a new circuit assembly program operating, with the program highlighting the Bible study work. We suggest that by all means you do not miss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for Ood to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> continues to be received well in the field and demand for it is very heavy. We rejoice to see the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon the work. May Jehovah’s rich blessing be with you as you use the book to aid righteously disposed persons to learn to worship the living God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">Go . .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It was Sunday evening. A dedicated brother had just returned from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study. As he sat alone quietly in his home, thoughts of the ministry filled his mind. “In what ways do I need to make progress?” he asked himself. Jesus’ instruction came to mind: ‘Go and make disciples of people of all the nations, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.’ (Matt. 28:19, 20) “I had a good share in the witness work this week,” he thought to himself. “But where do I need to improve? Jesus said ‘teach.’ Really, how well do I teach? Perhaps this is where I need to improve.” It was very beneficial for this brother to reflect and examine himself like this. After thinking things over, this brother followed through and made good progress. Have you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In February we will all be busy in the witness work presenting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription. To present the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription most effectively in the field, have you done some advance planning and preparing, just as you do with your student talks? If you do you may be able to help householders to learn how greatly they will be benefited personally by the truths presented in this magazine. Let’s talk about </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and its benefits, or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> if you will be offering a double subscription, at every opportunity as we endeavor to help other people to learn the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But back to what Jesus said at Matthew 28:20: In our ministry our goal is to teach other people so that eventually they will want to observe and do all the things that we have been commanded to do. Our just placing literature with interested ones does not usually accomplish this, does it? Why, often it is necessary for us to call back and discuss things further to get the householder even to open the literature again. So regular back-calls</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark3"></a>. Teach'</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">and effective Bible studies are needed if we are to teach these people to be “doers of the word.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The brother mentioned in our first paragraph found that he needed to get started in the Bible study work in order to be a better teacher. Is this a step you need to take too? He got the help he needed. You can too, from the brothers with whom you are associated. One of the mature publishers or your own parents will be glad to assist you. Also, the Society has asked the circuit servant and, if married, his wife to endeavor to start two studies each week and turn these over to publishers in the congregation they are visiting. Why not arrange to work with them the next time they visit the congregation? They will be glad to turn one of these studies over to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> How and when can studies be started? Perhaps you have observed that some publishers endeavor to start studies on the initial call, and often this is a good time, while the householder’s interest is still strong. Some, after placing the literature, say: ‘Everyone who obtains this literature is entitled to a free demonstration so he can know how to use it in understanding his own Bible. If you would like, I would be happy to demonstrate this for you right now.’ To succeed in starting a study usually requires that we take the initiative. Have you offered to study the new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie' </span><span class="font10">book with one of your relatives, a friend or neighbor, or with someone who studied before and still shows interest in the truth? You may have success if you try.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> It is good to review our activities from time to time, whether we are alone at home or together in the Kingdom Hall, isn’t it? We all have the assignment to ‘teach others to observe all the things Jesus has commanded.’ May Jehovah bless us as we help one another to do this work well.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: ‘Go . . . Teach.’ Song 17. 5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Jesus Was a Teacher and Our Model. This should be a Scriptural talk highlighting Jesus’ activity as a teacher and his manner of teaching. Encourage all to follow his example. Fine information appears in the April 1, 1960, issue of “The Watchtower,” pages 200-206. See also “Watch Tower Publications Index” under the heading “Teachers” and the subheading “Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: ‘Go . . . Teach.’ Questions and answers on main article. Read paragraphs 1, 4, 5 and 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Various Ways Studies Can Be Started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman, preferably Bible study servant, analyzes the Bible study activity of congregation and pioneers. How are we doing in working toward the suggested goals? Are publishers averaging one, regular pioneers seven and special pioneers ten? Comments on importance of conducting Bible studies to fulfill our commission to ‘go . . . teach.’ What can we do this month to start more studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(10 min.) Have individuals in audience prepared to tell how they have started studies when (1) literature was initially placed, (2) by arranging for a definite back-call when circumstances did not permit starting a study when literature was placed, (3) when householder already had magazine subscription, and (4) by use of' suggestion under “Presenting the Good News” in November “Kingdom Ministry.” Discuss them one at a time. After discussing each one, chairman will ask publisher briefly to demonstrate his approach, -what he said or how he handled things in getting the study started. Experiences may be given in connection with each way as time permits. Many fine experiences are coming into the Society’s office telling of the success brothers are having in following the suggestion given on page four in the November “Kingdom Ministry.” Have you tried to start studies in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Discuss the need for more Bible studies. Encourage all to fulfill our commission to ‘go . . . teach’ by conducting Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Closing comments. Include some news items, high points of Branch Letter and appropriate Announcements, “311,933 Praisers of Jehovah” and report bn congregation accounts. (Material rfiight be presented as news broadcast or otherwise as desired. To the extent possible, make this part alive, fresh, newsy and interesting.) Song 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: “What Is Looked for . . . Is for a Man to Be Found Faithful.” Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 12 min: “Presenting the Good News During the Time Set Aside.” Congregation book study conductor calls on publisher irregular in the ministry. Publisher tells of his good plans for field service, but how unexpected and unavoidable difficulties interfered. Consider together information under “Presenting the Good News,” reading parts of article. Be kind. Encourage. Be optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: “Finding Increased Joy in Jehovah’s Service.” Questions and answers; discuss scriptures; read paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Stand Strong in the Faith. Chairman should encourage all to continue personal study, meeting attendance and service so we may all remain strong in the faith. Prepared publishers should be called on to relate experiences. These can be presented as “first-person reports.” Make presentations alive, forceful, describing things as they happened, just as if you were there and saw and experienced it all. After relating the experience, the publisher should tell what impression the experience made on him. The chairman can also emphasize the point of each experience. (You may choose to include the account in the 1966 “Yearbook” on page 235, paragraph 2, of the brother who was imprisoned. See page 239, paragraph 2, about a pioneer brother. Personal impressions of the publishers might include comments on Acts 5:41 or Revelation 2:10. See the “Yearbook,” page 284, paragraph 1, about the increase Jehovah has given in Russia. See also the account of two parents in the “Awake!” of November 8, 1965. pages 17-19, which brings to mind Psalm 19:7, 11.) In conclusion chairman should encourage all in congregation to take advantage of freedom to grow stronger spiritually by regular study, meeting attendance and keeping busy in the ministry. , 10 min: Concluding comments. Encourage all to faithful, regular service. Give congregation report to date, including subscriptions placed. Commend brothers for work done. Read and comment on Question Box. Song 57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Delight to Do Jehovah’s Will. Song 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “What Is a Christian’s Responsibility to the Needy and the Sick?” “Watchtower,” February 1, 1966. It is suggested that, after brief introductory remarks, chairman invite all publishers to look up James 2:15, 16. After reading the scripture ask the congregation for suggestions as to how the counsel in this scripture can be applied. Then read Galatians 6:10 and ask for comments from the congregation as to how the counsel in this verse can be followed. In conclusion the chairman can give a brief talk summarizing the points made in the article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Following Up on Subscription Promises and Those Not at Home. Two publishers discuss progress they have made individually and the progress of the congregation in meeting suggested goal of two subscriptions per publisher during the campaign. One publisher suggests to another how they personally might obtain subscriptions by calling back on those who promised to subscribe and those who were not at home when they first called. When householder shows interest in subscription it is good to try to set a definite time for the return call and then keep the appointment. Take a positive view. Show the householder the great value of the magazine and how he personally will benefit. Interesting experiences showing the appreciation of the public for “The Watchtower’’’ can be found in “Awake!” of February . 22, 1964, page 19, and in “The Watchtower,” February 1, 1964, page 87, under “Changed Attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When asked if our introduction when calling back on those who were not at home should be the same as in regular house-to-house work, publisher suggests that it is usually best to tell the householder that you called before and because he was not home you have come back to present this very important information to him personally. This Often stir,s greater interest in the message. You might tell of' your own successful experi-, ences in following up on subscription promises and those not at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Overcoming Obstacles and Keeping Busy in the Work of the Lord. In your congregation there are no doubt a number of obstacles the brothers face at this time of year that sometimes interfere with their regularly sharing in service. (It may be much snow or rain, caring for small children, sickness, lack of transportation or something else. Discuss only obstacles that face many in your congregation.) Chairman, perhaps assistant congregation servant, can name two or three obstacles that face those in the congregation and then ask audience for suggestions as to how these can be overcome and how we can help one another to have a regular share in the service. Chairman may also add his own suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3 min: Vacation Pioneering. Two sisters walk toward platform, one asking the other: “Are you going to be at the special meeting of those who are planning to vacation pioneer in April?” Publisher hesitant; would like to vacation pioneer, but cannot see how to work every thing-out. First sister says that is reason for meeting, so that all can discuss the situation and see what they can do to help one another. Publisher didn’t realize that; glad to know; will be present. (See tenth item under Announcements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Concluding comments. Include “Over 4,500,000 Copies.” Song 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Holding Fast as Slaves of Our Repurchaser. Song 86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">6 min: Introduction, text, comments. Also high points of March 1, 1966, “Watchtower” article on theme for month, making personal application of material to theocratic activities of congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: “But, How Can I Help?” Question-and-answer coverage. Read paragraphs if time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: “Yearbook” experiences on vacation pioneering. Consider items on page 76 paragraph 2, 90 fll, 170 fl3, 232 fi2, 236 fll. Report how many in your congregation have applied for vacation pioneer service in April. Invite any who would like to do so, but have not yet made out an application, to ask for an application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Settling Personal Difficulties. Talk based on material in “Make Sure,” pages 446-448. In “Make Sure” questions are asked in each of the eight subheadings. These should be the basis or outline for the talk. Invite all to follow along in “Make Sure” or in their Bible as the Bible answer to each question is read and discussed. Comments on some scriptures can be entertained from audience if desired. You will probably have time to read and comment on only one scripture under each heading. Do not try to crowd too much material into the presentation. Rather, make it clear and simple so all understand the points. Do not scold. Rather, let the Bible teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 34.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FINDING INCREASED JOY IN JEHOVAH'S SERVICE</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How happy we are to be numbered among Jehovah’s people! (Isa. 65:13, 14) As his witnesses, we have a treasured privilege of service, and we are grateful for it. Jehovah has not used his angels to shout the Kingdom good news from the heavens for all men to hear. Rather, through his Son he has entrusted it to us, confidentially as it were, and has commissioned us to make it known publicly. Sharing in this God-given work results in the enjoyment of rich blessings from our Father in heaven.—Matt. 10:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But with this great privilege goes responsibility. It is Jehovah’s announced purpose for his name “to be declared in all the earth.” (Rom. 9:17) Through his Son he has informed us that “in all the nations the good news has to be preached.” (Mark 13:10) So there is work to be done, and the time is short. If even the Devil knows that “he has a short period of time,” how much more so should we be aware of the urgency of the situation!—Rev. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> This urgency in no way diminishes our joy. We volunteered to work; we expect to work, and there is no other work on earth that we would rather be doing at this time. (Ps. 110:3) We find joy in serving Jehovah. Understandably, then, those who can share in that service in fuller measure experience even greater joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> While all of us share in the ministry to the extent that we are able to do so each month of the year, there are thousands of Jehovah’s people who put forth a special effort as vacation pioneers during certain months. Those who spend a full month in this activity devote 100 hours to the field ministry; others, who enroll for two weeks, report 75 hours for the entire month. This is open to any regular publisher who has been baptized and who is recommended by the congregation committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> How do those who have been vacation pioneers feel about it? A sister from Washington, D.C., wrote: “As a congregation publisher I have experienced many happy moments in the field service, but April 1965 proved to be the happiest month of all my ministerial service to Jehovah. You see, I had the joy of being a vacation pioneer.” A publisher from New Jersey wrote: “I just can’t find enough adjectives to describe the happiness I’ve enjoyed.” From Massachusetts came the expression: “There are no words adequate to describe the joy I have had while vacation pioneering, but I just had to write and tell you how grateful I am this privilege of service is available.” A brother from Illinois described it as “the most enjoyable month of my life.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Why was it such a happy month for them? Principally because they find their greatest happiness in doing Jehovah’s will, and as vacation pioneers they were able to devote more time to it. Increased activity also made it possible for them to do a more thorough job of following up on interest shown, and there is satisfaction in that. Some experienced that, while they had little success in starting home Bible studies before, during the time they vacation pioneered they were able to start several.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It was not just a few who shared in this vacation pioneer service during the year, but many thousands. In the United States there were 25,448 in April alone, and thousands more in other months. In Argentina more than 10 percent of the publishers enrolled as vacation pioneers last April, and nearly two and a half times that number during the entire year. In Congo Republic, 18 percent of the publishers were sharing in the full-time service in April. And tfiere were similar fine responses in other lands around the globe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Can you, too, share in this service? Just what is there that might prevent a person from being a vacation pioneer at some time during the year? Would old age? Not necessarily, because not long ago a publisher in Oklahoma who was 103 years of age thoroughly enjoyed a month of this service. Does having young children make it impossible? This Scriptural responsibility definitely should not be slighted,<sup>1</sup> but the fact is that this past year there were many sisters with youngsters who enrolled and met the requirements without neglecting their families. What about those with unbelieving mates? A sister in Pennsylvania admitted: “I somehow viewed this as not for me, since I have four small children, two preschool age, and an unbelieving mate.” But, with the cooperation of her children and other publishers in the congregation,, she, along with many in similar circumstances, enjoyed vacation pioneering. Might poor health make it impossible to vacation pioneer? It might make it more difficult, but there are many with varying health</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">[Be sure to keep this insert. It will be used during March and April also.]</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">problems that have been able to enjoy this service at times. Surely this service would not be possible for a man who must hold a full-time job to support his household, some might say. But many of them, too, vacation pioneer. Some find such pleasure in this service that, for a period of two weeks from time to time, they actually pioneer after working hours, during strikes, in seasons when work is slow or at vacation time. Additionally, there are thousands of single persons, some who are of school age and some older, who frequently use their vacations to pioneer. As one brother said, after his first vacation spent as a pioneer: “I have done many things on vacation in the past, but this has been the most memorable of all.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Many whose circumstances might make it difficult for them to vacation pioneer alone find that, with the mutual assistance of a group, they are able to do it. In some localities the servants in the congregation have been able to take the lead in this activity, and this has greatly encouraged others to follow their example. Also, groups of sisters and families have discussed their situation together and, among themselves, arranged their affairs so they could vacation pioneer. During the month of April there is much special activity—the special public talk, Memorial, special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines to distribute, reaching out for a new peak in the number of praisers of Jehovah—so thousands find this a good month to plan together for vacation pioneer service. Others,'unable to do it in April, may enroll in May, June, July or any other month. The fact is that there are vacation pioneers enrolled every month of the year, because they can see that “the harvest is great, but the ' workers are few.” (Matt. 9:37) They prize the privilege of being numbered among Jehovah’s people and want to share in serving him as fully as their circumstances will permit. In doing so, they are finding increased joy in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A GRAND PRIVILEGE OF SERVICE</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How do you feel about the ministry? Is it a burden or a blessing? The Lord Jesus, though spoken against and even mobbed during the first year of his preaching activity on earth, delighted to do his Father’s will. The apostle Paul, too, viewed the ministry as a privilege, and said: “I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry.” (1 Tim. 1:12) So, too, in our case, it was not compulsion but a heartfelt response to God’s love that moved us to make a dedication to Jehovah and become active preachers of the good news.—1 John 4: 16-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> That does not mean that it is always easy for us to share in Jehovah’s service. Careful planning may be required. Some undergo severe opposition because of their determination to serve God. But appreciation for the privilege of serving the interests of our loving heavenly Father moves us to surmount these obstacles and share in the ministry as fully as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In the case of some, the hours they are able to devote in the actual field ministry might be compared to the two small coins that Jesus observed a woman depositing in the temple treasury in Jerusalem. What she did was pleasing to God, because, as Jesus said, she gave “all of what she had, her whole living.” (Mark 12:41-44) Others are able to spend more time in the service; regularly each week they are out preaching, averaging at least ten hours a month. Still others have been able to arrange their affairs to devote at least one hundred hours every month to praising Jehovah publicly as regular pioneers, and, if they are able to do that without neglecting other Scriptural responsibilities, it is the reasonable thing for them to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> That is the way those who are regular pioneers feel about it. As a newly enrolled pioneer in Kentucky wrote: “When I made my dedication to Jehovah, it was for all my time, not just what I could spare from other activities. So actually, I felt that if I was in a position to pioneer and didn’t, I wouldn’t be fulfilling my dedication.” Another, in California, said: “The same desire that moved me to be baptized moved me to become a regular pioneer. I wanted to serve Jehovah.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Interestingly, most of those who are nqw pioneers at one time felt that, in view of their circumstances, they could not enter this full-time service. But that is not strange, because when they were first learning the truth many of them also felt that they could never go from house to house preaching to others. Yet in time their growing love for Jehovah moved their mouths to speak, and they found that, when they relied on Him, He strengthened them for the work. To have time for the ministry as congregation publishers, they found that they had to buy it out from other pursuits, and love for Jehovah moved them to do that. (Eph. 5:15, 16) They did not argue: ‘Well, if Jehovah requires me to study the Bible and go to meetings, I will do that; but I am never going to preach.to others; that is asking too much.’ Nor, when they became congregation publishers did they reason to themselves: ‘If I have to preach, I will do it as a congregation publisher; but being a pioneer is just too much.’ No; they view the ministry, not as a burden, but as a blessing. (Matt. 11:29, 30) They want to have the fullest possible share in doing the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done at this time. They feel as the psalmist who said: “Jehovah is great and very much to be praised.” —Ps. 145:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> But, now, what about these who at one time felt that they could not pioneer but have succeeded in taking hold of that grand privilege of service? How did they get started? In various ways. Some were in position to alter their circumstances, and they did it, to make more time for what they realized was the most important thing in their life. There were many who were encouraged by the example of others. Frequently, those who really wished that their circumstances would permit them to pioneer enrolled as vacation pioneers for a month or two to put the matter to the test and see if they could succeed as regular pioneers. Many of them found that pioneering was not as difficult as they had anticipated. It called for better personal organization in their lives; but, then, it brought deeper satis-</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>MAKING A CAREER</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The majority of working people view their employment only as a means to obtain the necessities of life. Some are very conscientious about their work, but comparatively few have such love for their work that they devote themselves to constant study and specialized training in or- , der to be equipped to share in it more fully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Yet Christians are encouraged to apply themselves in just such a wholehearted way to the ministry. Rather than viewing it simply as a job at which they spend only as much time as is required, it becomes the most important thing faction too. They began to realize that when they relied on Jehovah more heavily, he blessed them more richly. Not only was their ministry more productive, but their home life was happier too. Having tasted the blessings of this service, they knew that they would not be really content until they could enjoy it regularly; so they filled out their applications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> A considerable number of the younger pioneers say that for years they had anticipated enrolling as soon as they finished high school, and that is what they did. For'as long as they could remember, their parents had taught them to prize spiritual treasures above material possessions. (Matt. 6:19-21) Together they had read the life stories of full-time ministers published in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> At vacation time their parents had pioneered with them. They now realized that in the pioneer ranks they could give the fullest expression to their love for Jehovah, that it would prove to be the most satisfying activity, and that it offered a future far better than anything that the world could produce. How grateful they are that their parents had so lovingly taught them to view things Jehovah’s way!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> If you are one whose heart moves you to want to make fuller expression of your love for Jehovah, why not consider again the possibility of pioneer service. Analyze your own circumstances. Discuss the matter with the other members of your family. Talk to pioneers, to your congregation servant or to your circuit servant when he visits your congregation. Try it out as a vacation pioneer. But most of all, make it a matter of prayer to Jehovah. In this way you may find that you, too, ean be one of the thousands regularly enjoying this grand privilege of service.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>OF THE MINISTRY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">in their life. They make a career of the ministry; that is, they view it as a course of constant, progressive achievement. They take to heart the Scriptural counsel to “press on to maturity,” to “widen out,” to be absorbed in the ministry, that their “advancement may be manifest to all persons.”—Heb. 6:1; 2 Cor. 6:13; 1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When one first starts out in Jehovah’s service, if he looks to Jehovah for direction and applies himself, his progress will readily be apparent. In a comparatively short period of time he will be commenting in the meetings, going from house to house, making back-calls and sharing in the home Bible study activity. But once the ministry becomes an established part of his life, will he continue to progress? Will the ‘love that he had at first’ lose its vigor, or will it move him to further advancement?—Rev. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If we keep strong our love for Jehovah, our service to God will never become just a job at which we work, but it will continue to be the most important part of our life. We will build our lives around it, as Jesus did. (John 18:37) There will be regular advancement made. We will have goals in mind toward which we are working. For example, we may be concentrating on overcoming objections met in the ministry, learning pointed Scripture texts on a variety of topics, improving teaching ability on home Bible studies, sharing more fully in congregation meetings, training others in the ministry, perhaps qualifying as a servant in the congregation. Do you have such a goal toward which you are working? Is there evidence of continued progress in your ministry? Is it really your career?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Those who are able to arrange their circumstances to pioneer find that it opens up many new avenues for advancement in their ministerial career. Daily experience in the ministry speeds up their progress to maturity. With increased frequency they enjoy the heartwarming privilege of aiding newly interested ones to become active praisers of .Jehovah. Furthermore, service as a regular pioneer can also be a stepping-stone to other fields of full-time service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Those who now serve as special pioneers have experienced that. They were once regular pioneers; they enjoyed their work, did well in it, and were willing and able to serve wherever they might be needed. Now, as special pioneers they share all the blessings of regular pioneer service and, in addition, they have the privilege of opening up new territory and organizing new congregations. It was in this type of service that the apostle Paul particularly took pleasure, and the record of his ministry continues to be a source of inspiration to those who reach out for this privilege of service.—Rom. 15:20-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> From the ranks of those who have been pioneers for at least two years, there are at least two hundred' each year who are invited to take. a special five-month training course at Gilead School in preparation for foreign missionary service. During their time of schooling they share in a verse-by-verse interpretative study of the Bible from Genesis through Revelation. Basie Bible doctrines are thoroughly discussed. History as it relates to the Bible, improving one’s ministerial ability and organizational principles all are given careful attention. In preparation for the missionary assignment to which they will be sent, they are also given intensive instruction in language, usually the one that they will particularly need to know. Though they will be moving out to a land where living conditions may be quite different from those to which they are accustomed, they have no need for concern about their physical necessities, because, not only does the Watch Tower Society assist them, but they have the dependable assurance of their Father in heaven that, if they seek continually the in- -terests of his kingdom, he will see that these other things are provided for them.—Luke 12: 22-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Others who took the forward step of pioneering have since been appointed as circuit and district servants. They proved themselves faithful in a few things and, in accord with the Bible principle, now they have been put in charge of more. (Matt. 25:19-23) As whole-souled servants, they share to an even greater extent the joy of their Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> For many, pioneering has been a stepping-stone to service at Bethel, where they find it richly rewarding to know that what they do is a contribution to the ministry of their brothers everywhere. They love their work, because they feel as the psalmist who said: “A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.” (Ps. 84:10) Some who entered the pioneer work years ago have now been at Bethel for twenty to sixty years, and they have enjoyed grand privileges of service. Indeed, they have made the ministry their career!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> To the extent that you are able to fill your life with the ministry, you too will be able to crowd out the old system of things and its frustrations. As you lay hold of enlarged privileges of service you will enjoy to a greater extent the contentment that is the portion of the people of God. The knowledge and capabilities that you acquire now will help to equip you for further privileges in God’s righteous new system of things. So let the fullness of your love stimulate you to move ahead in the ministry, making it in reality your career.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But, How Can I Help?&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A concerned father and mother, interested in the congregation, approached their overseer, and with some discouragement said, “We have often heard encouragement given to the congregation to be generous in offering personal assistance to others. But, really, it seems that when we have looked after ourselves and the children, seeing that we get to the meetings, into the service and study together, there just isn’t time left to do much in helping anyone else.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Are you a parent who has a keen desire to assist, and who has ended up asking, “But, how can I help?” Well, maybe you are helping—more than you realize.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Look at it this way: You want to help the congregation. Fine. Your children are a part of the congregation, aren’t they? Certainly! Why, in some congregations children make up half or even more than half of the congregation. So, if they are helped, a very large contribution is being made to strengthen the congregation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Have you ordered an increased supply of the special April 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">and April 22 Awake! for the congregation? Magazine goals for the month are thirty for publishers, two hundred for pioneers and three hundred for special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The offer for February through April is the Watchtower subscription, with three booklets, for $1. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> subscriptions, with six booklets, can be offered for $2. ♦ Offer for May: Each congregation may present any older book of which it has a large supply. Use up all supplies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.&quot;</span><span class="font8"> When your supply of older books has been exhausted check with nearby congregations. The Society has on hand 29,000 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand,&quot;</span><span class="font8"> which you may order for use during May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Memorial will be celebrated after 6 p.m. on Tuesday, April 5, 1966. Memorial invitations may be ordered from the Society using the regular Handbill Order form. The price is 25c a thousand; 15c for five hundred; 10c for two hundred and fifty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A special public talk entitled “What Binding Satan the Devil Will Mean for Mankind” is scheduled for April 3. Manuscript for the talk will be sent to each congregation. Handbills featuring just this talk are available. Please order your handbills early. Congregations having circuit assemblies scheduled that weekend may have the special talk on April 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ If the circuit servant is with your congregation during the week of Memorial, Wednesday should be used for field service and the service meeting may be held on Wednesday evening. Congregations being visited that week may ask the circuit or district servant to handle the Memorial if they wish. ♦ Early in February the overseer should meet with the accounts servant </span><span class="font10">tance? Why, you, the parents, of course. Not only is this your Scriptural responsibility but you are in the best position to do so. Thus, when you are regular in studying with them, working in the field with them, getting to the meetings and commenting at those meetings with them, you very likely are having as full a share in giving personal assistance as any in the congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Actually, if you are carrying out your family responsibilities well, you may be doing even more in the congregation than what has just been mentioned. How is that? Well, all of us influence others in some way. If the family is poorly organized and irregular in service and meeting attendance, this is not the best influence on others. On the other hand, if the family is well organized, zealous in service and attends all meetings, this is a wholesome influence, having far-reaching effects for good in the congregation. So, here is another reason for parents to be concerned with giving' personal assistance first to their own</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">to discuss his duties. Arrange for an audit of accounts on March 1. Are subscriptions being prepared and sent to the Society </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">each week?</span><span class="font8"> Consider servant’s field activity and work together in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Suggested meetings for field service: February 13: Ways to Start Studies This Morning. (See page two.) February 20: Effective Introductions in Your Territory. February 27: Talking Points in the Current </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font8">March 6: Plan your own program. ♦ Starting February 6, the district servants’ new public talk will be “Does God Have Influence in This Twentieth Century?” Beginning March 6, the circuit servants’ new talk will be “How Practical Is the Search for Wealth?” ♦ Many who would like to vacation pioneer find it encouraging to know who else has in mind doing it at the same time they want to. So we suggest that, at the end of February, the overseer arrange a convenient time, perhaps after a meeting, when those interested in vacation pioneer service in April can get together to discuss their plans. This will afford them opportunity to work out arrangements among themselves, and it will enable the overseer to determine what arrangements for group witnessing should be made to assist them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ “Portugal Continues to Persecute Jehovah’s .Witnesses.” That is the title of an extensive special report in the February 22 issue of Awake! The Society would like to have this issue receive as wide a distribution as possible. to give support to our brothers in Portugal. Can you use extra copies? If so, please order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Each regular and special pioneer who has been on the list since July 1, 1965, may receive a free copy of the new </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index </span><span class="font8">for 1961-1965 by making request through </span><span class="font10">children. Think of it in terms of making your family a good </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">family example.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> But do you still have the desire to help others outside your family? Maybe you can. Many are able to look after their families well and still offer such assistance. Some have found that, as long as they are going out in the service anyway, it doesn’t take too much time to encourage and arrange for a less-experienced publisher or two to go along. Also, some parents are pioneers and can take others along during the day without too much, if any, loss of time. And sometimes older children in a well-organized family can assist other children. Maybe through one of these ways you can fulfill your desire personally to help some besides your family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Need busy parents ask in discouragement, “But, how can I help?” No, because they are already helping greatly, aren’t they? Indeed, parents can rejoice in having more opportunities for giving personal assistance than most other publishers. Keep up your good work, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">The account in this chapter is fast moving and the study of this material should be kept moving too. It is not intended to be a detailed, long-drawn-out affair, but it gives the reader a quick r6sum6 of the entire Bible account as it relates to the Seed of promise and thus lays a good foundation for the study material that follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not necessary to read all those scriptures listed in the footnotes during the time set aside for your study, but they are there for consultation by those who want to know the basis for the information presented on the page. However, if you as a study conductor, whether at a home Bible study or at a congregation book study, feel that it would be beneficial for those present to read a few key verses directly from the Bible during the study of this part of the book, you may pick them out ahead of time and use them to emphasize the high points of the lesson.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever planned to share in field service on a certain day and then had unavoidable circumstances interfere with your plans? Most of us have had that experience. Perhaps there was sickness in your family, severe weather or a breakdown in the transportation needed to get to the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> However, if we have set aside a certain time for field service, it may not be necessary to miss out just because unexpected situations arise. When we stop and think about it, there are many ways to present the good news even if unavoidable circumstances make it impossible for you to follow through with your original plans. For example, possibly you could work the territory right around your home. Or, perhaps you could resort to public transportation to get to the territory. Some have used the telephone to make return visits on people with whom literature had been placed or to make comforting calls on those who had lost loved ones.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Of course, you could also write letters. In Alaska, a pioneer- wrote a letter to a person whose subscription had expired but whose address was just a box number. One evening there was a knock at the pioneer’s door, and there stood the man and</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">311,933 publishers in the field is an excellent report for December! Our united efforts to praise our God and the resulting grand witness before men and angels unquestionably made Jehovah’s heart glad. Only during April 1965, with warming spring weather, did more share in the witness work in the United States in 1965, when there were 327,588 who shared in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just consider for a moment the fine way Jehovah blessed our efforts. In the months from April to December the number who shared in the ministry varied from month to month. Of course, some of the new ones had not yet come to appreciate the importance of regular service to Jehovah. With others, sickness and other unforeseen obstacles were permitted to interfere with their ministry. Yet in Decemhis wife with books under their arms. As reported in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font10">the man commented: “When it comes to religion, I can make just as many excuses as the next person, but when someone takes the time to write me a letter about it, I figure it is time to do something.” (Page 65) Some even conduct studies by mail. In the Bahamas, a woman became interested in the truth and it was agreed that she would study with a missionary in Nassau by mail. Because of her desire to learn, a chapter a week was covered in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.” (Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> page 71) While this sister wasn’t confined to her home, it does give you some idea of what can be done along these lines. As to what you might include in your letter, please refer to the September 1965 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> article “Have You Tried This?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Oh, yes, one more thought. In your letters it would often be good to refer to material in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> particularly if the person is a subscriber, for this will keep him alert to its excellent material, so conducive to developing a love for the truth. We do hope that some of these suggestions will help you to overcome obstacles so you can present the good news during the time you’ve set aside to do so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">ber, when many had difficulty with illness and when there were problems with bad weather and other obstacles, 311,933 were aided to have some part in the ministry. It just shows what can be done, with Jehovah’s blessing, when each of us arranges his own affairs to have a part in the service and when we try to help one another as we did in December, doesn’t it? Yes, December was an excellent month of activity to Jehovah’s praise!</span></p>

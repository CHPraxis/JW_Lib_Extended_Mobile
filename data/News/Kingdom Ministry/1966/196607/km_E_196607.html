<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY, 1966</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">There has been a lot of excitement around Bethel during June. The Gilead students have been talking about missionary partners and foreign assignments. Classes for the circuit and district servants have been in session, and we have been very busy filling your orders for the new songbooks and records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Just the other day we were talking about you young folks who are dedicated to Jehovah and the wonderful prospects ahead of you. You can get a truly fine education through the meetings at the Kingdom Hall, especially if you enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School. Then when you finish high school, there is the pioneer service open to you, and it is a joy to see many taking up that full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A great need still continues for brothers and sisters to take up missionary service in other lands. If a person enters the pioneer service when he graduates from high school, by the time he is twenty-one years of age he may well be ready for an invitation to Gilead and foreign service. If a person’s heart is set on doing the kind of work the apostle Paul did, traveling into foreign fields to spread the good news, what a life of joy he can experience!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then, of course, there is Bethel service to consider. Some have made it their life’s work. In time others leave to get married and then continue on in pioneer work, special pioneer activity or circuit service. Some may return later for training at Gilead School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So, wonderful opportunities exist for young persons who are devoted to Jehovah. This is something for parents to think about so that they aid them to develop a deep appreciation for spiritual things. Then they will want to build their lives around their service to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">You young folks have the prospect of full and satisfying lives ahead of you in Jehovah’s .service. Consider the possibilities seriously,</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach the Word-Anytime</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Many of us have been looking forward with keen anticipation to July this year. Why? Well, for quite a few oi us that is convention time. If you did not attend the assembly in Toronto, you may be heading north to Canada along with many of us for one of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies during July.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> What a happy time we will have! We will hear the Word of Jehovah come alive for us on the platform, and this will be most encouraging and upbuilding. Of course, we are all looking forward to that thought-provoking public talk, “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?” Additionally, on the way to and from the assembly no doubt you have in mind sharing the truth with people such as motel owners and personnel, gas station attendants, restauyes, prayerfully. When attending the “God’s4Sons of Liberty” District Assembly this summer, give careful attention to the talk on the first day, “What Full-Time Service Accomplishes”; also the keynote speech, “Building on a Right Foundation with Fire-Resistant Materials.” Then, why not sit in on the meetings held with those Interested in Gilead School and missionary service and those interested in Bethel service? We feel that, if you pay close attention to what is said at the assembly, you will feel motivated to action. But then do not fearfully hold back; with faith in Jehovah, act!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">The May report shows that there were well over 308,000 publishers in the field service during the month. During the 1960 service year we have consistently been able to report over 301,000 publishers each month. It is evident that there is a solid group of publishers who make up the main core of Jehovah’s witnesses here in the United States. That is fine. We hope that the rant people and others. If you haven’t tried this yet, we recommend it; many of us have had marvelous experiences in doing incidental witnessing. The truth is so wonderful, and we want to feel free to share it anywhere, anytime. —2 Tim. 4: 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Many of us are looking forward to having a vacation as a fine change of pace during July too. Some brothers have had excellent experiences during their vacation periods just because they had their Bible, briefcase and some literature along. Opportunities to witness are ever present, and if we take advantage of them we can enjoy some outstanding blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Of course, incidental preaching is not the only witnessing we will be doing in July, is it? Naturally, we want to start as many home </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font14">coming months will continue to show that steady activity on the part of Jehovah’s people here.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Many April reports from other lands have now been received, and it is gratifying to see what some have done. Belgium was up nearly 15 percent in publishers. Brazil had an increase of over 21 percent, so they now have 40,340 publishers. Chile reported a 22-percent increase. Republic of the Congo, with its branch office in Leopoldville, had a 54-percent increase. Truly marvelous! It is evident that the work is still moving ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Oh, yes, another point of progress : All the old buildings have been demolished on the lot next to our factory here in Brooklyn, and we expect at this time of writing that excavation will begin during June for the new ten-story printing plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">May Jehovah richly bless you as you continue to declare the good news of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Your brothers,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Theme: Paying Constant Attention to Our Teaching. (1 Tim. 4:16) Song 20. 15 min: Introduction, text and comments and handling of Branch letter. Give warm encouragement to young people and pioneers to make Gilead or Bethel their goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">17 min: Profitable discussion between publisher and honest inquirer who asks, “Did Peter Visit Rome?’’ (Based on March 1, 1966, “Watchtower,” pages 150-155.) Use main headings as guideposts to conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Preach the Word—Anytime.’’ Question-and-answer coverage. Keep lively and enthusiastic. Have scriptures read and applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">3 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Include some appropriate points on development of Scriptural theme from 1 Timothy 4:16. Also, cover “How Did We Do in May?” Song 89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Putting Jehovah’s Worship First in Our Lives. (Rev. 14:7) Song 92.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Introduction, text and comments. Two publishers discuss material and register appreciation for excellent encouragement that text provides for us day by day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: “Stepping Over into Macedonia.” Question-and-answer coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">17 min: Discussion of material in “Make Sure” on “Sign of Christ’s Presence,” pages 451-456. Could handle this as a TV interview with two brothers answering the question: “What makes you people think we are living in the last days?” Make the setting in accord with actual conditions. If working unassigned territory, or assisting another congregation, interview could be as a result of doing this work. If working local territory, then adjust setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers and demonstration of appropriate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Include appropriate thoughts on slogan on page four and selected items from Announcements and Theocratic News. Song 118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Attending Meetings with Regularity. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Song 41. 10 min: Introduction, text and comments and “Keep Up the Good Work.” 10 min: Discussion between two publishers on benefits of attending assemblies. Can draw on past experiences and blessings at assemblies or this year’s assembly, if have already attended one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk on “Make Sure” material on “Encouragement,” pages 171-174. If desirable, can have a short demonstration portraying an experienced brother calling on one who needs encouragement. This should be done in an upbuilding manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Demonstration. “Can We Do More to Help?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Chairman: Discusses the value of meetings. They build up our spirituality. We need all of them each week for growth to maturity. Meetings are highly essential to our Christian development and faith. We can help one another to attend.—Heb. 2:1; 3:12; 12:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) A mature sister visits another sister who has been missing a number of meetings. (If it seems practical, the sister might be calling on phone rather than personally visiting.) She wonders how the sister has been. Tells her about the excellent meetings they have been having and of the especially interesting subject to be discussed in public talk on Sunday. Does not scold her, shows a loving interest in her and her family, asks how the children are, whether they have had some illness, for there has been quite a bit of sickness of late. Wonders if she can be of help and gives encouragement in an upbuilding, friendly and helpful manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(1 min.) Chairman. How good it is that we show an interest in one another and, of course, when we see persons missing meetings, we want to encourage them and help them to be present, if at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(5 min.) Family (the ones above who have been missing meetings) just home from meeting, reflect on how much they enjoyed excellent talk. Glad they stayed for “Watchtower” study too. Brothers were so warm and friendly. They are glad sister called to express interest in them and remind them of good things they have been missing. Husband and wife sit down and talk over the situation. They realize they have been lacking in spirituality of late, have slacked their hands and need building up. They are concerned about influence of world on family without protection of God’s spirit. Wife asks: “What is holding us back? Why don’t we regularly attend meetings?” Husband then suggests: “Let’s list the reasons and see if we are justified in staying away from meetings.” Husband then lists such things as overtime, unexpected guests, the fact that he is tired when he comes home from secular work, and sometimes they plan for other things at the time the meetings are scheduled. Husband then reasons with wife and states that he realizes none of the above are sufficient reasons for not attending meetings. They both come to the right conclusion, that they should be attending meetings and it will do much to develop the spirituality of their family and give them the right outlook on life. Wife again expresses appreciation for the sister’s call, displaying a loving interest in them and family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) Chairman. Encourages audience to prepare for, attend and participate in meetings. Show a concern for others and their spiritual development. No need to criticize or condemn. Reason with them and lovingly offer help. This builds up unity, spirituality and better praisers of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Also, “Is It Listed?” and “Very Fine Encouragement.” Reason with publishers on importance of being friendly at Kingdom Hall. Greet strangers, build up warmth and loving atmosphere. Strangers should be such only one time. Song 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Please arrange program locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Become Mature Ministers in Order to Aid Others. Song 100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk on month’s theme. (Based on article in August 1, 1966, “Watchtower.”) Also include some points on the text and comments for the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Discussion between two mature brothers, with one preferably the magazine-territory servant, on the material in the Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk by mature brother based on May 1, 1966, “Watchtower” article “Increasing Happiness Through Christian Economy,” pages 283-286. Slant toward possible problems needing solution such as contributing toward rent of Kingdom Hall, families setting aside sufficient funds to attend conventions, or making contributions to the Society for the worldwide advancement of the work, or whatever local application is needed. May want to feature a discussion of appropriate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Demonstration on directing interested ones to the organization at home Bible studies by encouraging attendance at the Theocratic Ministry School. Stress use of visual aids to encourage attendance at the school. Use such aids as the counsel slip, school schedule, Bible and “Beneficial” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Could conduct review with audience on how theme has been developed throughout program. Song 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach the Word—Anytime </span><span class="font14">(Conf’tZ) Bible studies as we can, for we recognize how much good we can accomplish in this fine avenue of service. In this regard, several days ago one of the brothers here at Bethel was talking to a sister from his congregation, and she felt somewhat discouraged. The reason for this was that she couldn’t seem to fit her Bible study in at any other time except before the book study on Tuesday evening, and she felt this was not a proper time for it. This sister was encouraged by her overseer to feel free to preach the Word at anytime. Some of our brothers in urban areas have found they have had great success in conducting studies for the first hour of service on Sunday morning, and there is no objection to doing this either if you find it advantageous. You know your territory locally and what is best for it. (1 Cor. 9: 19-23) With regard to starting studies, we hope you enjoy the practical suggestions under Presenting the Good News in this issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We here at Bethel hope you have a fine time during July, attending an assembly, sharing the truth with others, placing bound books and starting studies. We will be doing the same things. When the month is finished, we should be able to look back on it with great satisfaction because of our zealous and voluntary works of preaching the Word anytime, anywhere.—Ps. 119: 108.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Are you one of the overseers that recently got a letter from the Society inviting your congregation to help a nearby congregation with their territory coverage this summer? Hundreds of overseers received letters like this not so very long ago, and we want you to know that the Society has every confidence that all of you brothers invited to share in this field will really do good work this summer and we hope you have a wonderful time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Some of you may feel that you are not covering your own assignment as much as you would like to, and we can appreciate why you might feel that way. However, if you could just see the records here in the Society’s office, we believe you would agree that you are doing well enough to be In position to help others. The harvest is indeed great, but the workers are few. Of course, it will require good planning in order to send groups of the proper size into the territory, as well as good advance organization so that the most possible time can be spent in this special activity. It may be, too, that you will be able to encourage some in your congregation to vacation pioneer so they can have the fullest possible share in this grand privilege.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In some cases you may want to stay with the congregation you are helping, to share in their meetings and to get to know the brothers</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Literature offer for July, August and September: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,”</span><span class="font12"> and a booklet, for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Suggested discussions at meetings for service: July 10: Review sermon in May </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry;</span><span class="font12"> this may be used during July, August and September. July 17: Consider appropriate talking points from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font12"> book. July 24: Review suggestions for starting studies as outlined in Presenting the Good News. July 31: Discuss what to put on House-to-House Record for effective return visits. August 7: Suggestions on directing interested ones to the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ New circuit assembly program begins in September. Title of public talk to be given by district servant: “Satisfying Mankind’s Greatest Need.’’ New film “God Cannot Lie” to be shown on Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Congregation servants will want to order regular pioneer supplies for the 1967 service year. Include 12 pink monthly report cards for each pioneer; also weekly record sheets for those who might need them. No need to order supplies for vacation pioneers. ♦ Congregations may want to make special field service arrangements for July 4, since it will be a holiday for most persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Is it possible for you to vacation pioneer in August? We will be pleased to receive your application. </span><span class="font14">there. This would be very enjoyable. And, of course, if some want to conclude their service day by enjoying a picnic lunch or other meal together, that is a personal matter. Your sharing of happy experiences together will make it a joyous occasion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> As for you congregations that are being helped under this arrangement, we know that you appreciate this help very much. The Society believes you feel just like Jesus, who said: “Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9: 38) But what can you brothers do to utilize this help to the full? You can supply ample territory, cooperate together in the working of it, follow up the calls made and, in general, welcome the assistance given. We recognize that the time is short, the work is urgent, and we all want to see that it gets done thoroughly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We know, too, that some of you brothers will be working unassigned territory this summer, and we wish you well in this special assignment. Whatever our work is this summer, whether we are assisting nearby congregations, working unassigned territory or covering local territory not often worked, we will all want to have the same spirit of zeal and love that Paul had when he willingly responded to the call: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.”—Acts 16: 9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">♦ if you are away on your vacation or perhaps are at an assembly at the end of the month, do not forget to send your report to your local congregation so it can be included with their July activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In the June issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> it was stated, in the Branch letter, that the attendance at the special public meeting in April was 326,263. Really it was much better than that. It should have read 362,263.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> It is most encouraging to hear of your consistent efforts to help our brothers get the necessary spiritual food. Those who stop coming to meetings indeed give us cause for great concern, and we know you feel this way about it too. A recent experience from New York state bears this point out, and we thought you would enjoy reading it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> “One of our brothers became inactive and stopped coming to the meetings some time ago. We visited him and worked hard to revive him, and the circuit servant went with us on several occasions, but all of this to no avail. We became somewhat discouraged. Then I read the many </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> experiences from the various countries where the brothers just kept going back as a friendly visit, not giving up. So just recently I went back and, sure enough, about three weeks later the brother called and asked to come back to the meetings and inquired if someone would study with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> “As the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> says, when we read experiences similar to ones we may encounter, ‘we get a head start on overcoming problems and objections.’ ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Is there someone you can help to attend meetings?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Is It Listed?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In many communities it is possible to open the telephone book to “Jehovah’s Witnesses” and find a number that can be called. Frequently it is the phone number of the congregation servant or, with his approval, someone else in the congregation. What are the results?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Well, at this time of year, when many people are traveling, our brothers and other interested persons travel too, and if they can locate Witnesses through the telephone book in those places where they visit, they often share with them in meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Also, in some localities newly interested persons have called, requesting a home Bible study. In other places representatives of local organizations have phoned to request that one of Jehovah’s witnesses visit them to explain their work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Do you have a telephone number listed under “Jehovah’s Witnesses” in your community? If you have a personal telephone, it usually involves only a small additional monthly charge. Whether you want to do it is for you to decide. But we thought you would be interested to know that others have had good results because their number was listed.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Recently one of the circuit servants suggested a practical and successful approach in connection with starting studies when working with the current offer. When we heard of it we thought that you would enjoy it too, since we know you are very much interested in building up your Bible study activity.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In using the current sermon, “The Bible Tells the Truth Concerning Man’s Future,” you could say something like this after reading 2 Peter 3:13: “What, then, must we do to live under that righteous new system of things? It is obvious we need to take in knowledge of it. But how can we best do this? It would be reasonable to assume that a Bible study would help us to get that knowledge, isn’t that right? And really that is the reason why I came to your door, to help you study your own copy of the Bible. As a minister I would be pleased to conduct a Bible study with you and your family without any charge or obligation whatsoever. We can use your own copy of the Bible or any copy of the Bible, and I feel sure you and your family would enjoy it very much.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If the offer to start a Bible study is accepted, then, of course,</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What a great pleasure It was for. us to tabulate the report for May and to see that 225,077 bound books were placed in one month! Just think of it, nearly a quarter of a million books filled with information that can aid sincere persons to transform their lives. No doubt many persons in addition to the ones to whom you talked will pick them up and read at least portions of those books. As a result of your efforts, many new Bible studies will be started in these homes too. So brothers, we rejoice that your combined efforts resulted in a great witness during May. </span><span class="font14">we have accomplished our purpose. We could then use the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News” </span><span class="font14">booklet and the householder’s copy of the Bible. If, on the other hand, the offer is not accepted because the person does not have the time for It or perhaps shows no inclination toward a Bible study, you might say this: “Well, in view of the fact that you cannot have a Bible study now, the next best thing for you is this splendid publication </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.’</span><span class="font14"> It’s available for just 50c, along with this free booklet, and I believe you will enjoy them both very much. You show quite an interest in what is right and undoubtedly your own personal research into this publication will prove to be very beneficial. Perhaps at a later date we can share some of the points in it together.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> So, if they accept the Bible study, which is first and foremost in our thinking, or if they accept the publication, with the possible hope of starting a Bible study later, in either event we are putting forth a real effort to preach the good news effectively.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Up the Good Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Recently one of our sisters sent the Society a letter she had received from someone she had written after learning of the loss of a loved one in this family. The letter is as follows:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> “Dear Mrs. S--- I am deeply</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">grateful to you for your long letter of sympathy and explanation of our hope of the resurrection. Such a thought brings great comfort at </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font14">time of the loss of one’s loved one. I have read and reread your letter and the enclosed tracts. The Bible does indeed hold the answers to all of our problems, even when we come face to face with death and the loss of one’s life companion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> “Thank you for trying to help me find the right way and the answers I need so much now. May God bless you for all the trouble you went to for me. Sincerely,” etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> So keep up the good work, brothers and sisters, and may Jehovah bless you as you keep on writing letters to all kinds of persons who need encouragement at this time.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>(Question (15ox</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">• In magazine activity are we always limited to not more than sixty seconds when making a presentation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” paragraph 34, suggests speaking a few words, for “about thirty to sixty seconds,” and mentioning the high points of the magazine. However, this does not mean we must always confine our speaking to a limit of sixty seconds. We search for the sheeplike persons, and, if in the magazine activity we meet someone who has questions about the Bible or the organization, it will be beneficial to take time then and give him an answer to his immediate questions as well as try to arrange for a call on him again at a later date. It is also proper to consider the local customs of the people and be willing to converse for several minutes where it is customary in order to show ourselves friendly and interested in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When there is much territory to be covered, we usually make our presentations brief so we can reach more homes. But in some places territories are limited and, if we spend a little more time at a call, we may have better success in placing our magazines and arranging for back-calls, which can lead to home Bible studies. It is good to let each publisher determine what is the best method to use in his territory to distribute magazines and build up interest.</span></p>

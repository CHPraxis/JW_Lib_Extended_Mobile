<p><span class="font12">My recent trip through Mexico, Central and South America was certainly enjoyable. The enthusiasm for the 1966-1967 assemblies is running high, and all are so happy that, many brothers are coming. I had the opportunity to visit twenty-one branch offices, discuss Kingdom interests with branch servants, dedicate a new Kingdom Hall and branch office, meet many happy missionaries, talk to local congregations and at district assemblies, as well as arrange for the 1966-1967 convention sites. The brothers worked diligently in trying to find sufficient hotel accommodations for 400 brothers who are planning to visit Central America and for another group of 400 who will be going to South America, all by air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I made arrangements for English-speaking sessions for some mornings at the assemblies as well as for field service. At these special meetings in the morning the travelers will be able to meet and hear the local missionaries and the branch staff. I have arranged for them to give a complete history of the work in their lands and to report many of their experiences. What a pleasure it will be to listen to these missionaries, some of whom have been in their Spanish and Portuguese assignments for fifteen or twenty years! Some of the Society’s board of directors will be speaking at these morning sessions too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">AU- of those whose names were sent to the Society letting us know that they plan to go will receive a letter and a questionnaire around March 1, 1966. They will have to fill it in and return it to the Society in Brooklyn along with a preliminary deposit, and that will assure us that they really intend to make the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For excitement—the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which. It Is Impossible for God to Lie,”</span><span class="font12"> in Spanish, is going tremendously well. Some branches have already placed their third large order with the Brooklyn</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Delighting to Do God's Will</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Are you sure that we have been out for two hours already? Why, it seems as if we just got started.” Isn’t it true that when we are doing something interesting and enjoyable time flies? And, in connection with our ministerial service, do we not have abundant reasons to delight in the grand privilege of serving the happy God, Jehovah?—1 Tim. 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> One thing that helps us to get full joy is having a balanced view of the preaching activity. We know that not everyone is going to respond favorably to the Kingdom message. (John 10:25, 26) Does this discourage us? No, not at all, for we appreciate that we are only messengers. Our responsibility is to present the truth in the best possible manner and then leave it up to the individuals concerned to decide what they are going to do. If some reject the Kingdom message, that is their responsibility. Perhaps the next time we call, there will be , a more favorable response. Regardless of how we are received, printing plant, where half a million copies have been printed. I was also asked, “When are we going to get the complete Spanish Bible?” You know, our brothers do not have any idea of the work involved in translating the entire </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> into any language. But their desire is great and they surely want this Bible translation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">It was a real pleasure to be with my brothers in Central and South America and to have something to do with making the arrangements for the assemblies. Some of the men having to do with air travel said that this is the largest group of “tourists” that they have ever tried to move at one time from city to city in South America. I am very pleased that so many of you have decided to go, because, this will bring joy to our fellow workers there. All the brothers I met along we still show kindness and empathy and do not allow a lack of response to rob us of our joy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps you have found it profitable before engaging in the service to ask yourself: “What do I want to accomplish, what is my overall objective?” Having this clearly in mind, we can next ask: “How does giving the sermon or obtaining a subscription relate to this overall objective?” If our objective is to encourage more Bible reading or promote greater understanding of the Bible, then it is not too difficult to relate the sermon, the starting of studies or the placing of literature to this. If we can help the householder to realize our main purpose, his mind will be put at ease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At times we work in territory where not too much literature is placed. Should this be a cause for discouragement? No! not at all, because the important thing is to help people. If we can say that we left people .in a better frame of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">the way sent their warm love and greetings to all their brothers everywhere. They appreciate very much the marvelous support you have given them too, because you have made it possible for many missionaries to stay in these countries through your generous contributions to the Society. I want to thank you, too, in behalf of the Society.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Now we are in a wonderful </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we will make this another good subscription year and a year in which we start many new home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you. Be assured of my warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brother,</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Helping Others to the Way of Life. Song 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: Obtaining New Subscriptions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Tell publishers how many have been obtained to date. Draw comments from audience on following points: (1) Why we want people to receive “The Watchtower.’’ (2) Benefits they will receive from reading it. (3) What is there in current issue to which you could particularly direct attention? What did you learn from that article? (4) Possibilities for obtaining subscriptions and local experiences. Publisher can be assigned to read experiences from “Yearbook’’ (p. 250, par. 2; p. 261, par. 3). (Have some prepared in advance to comment.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Talk on article “Will You Have Enough?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Acquainting Newly Interested Ones with Jehovah’s Organization. CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Chairman discusses following points with audience. Over 225,000 Bible studies were conducted in U.S. each month last year. Many are not yet joining us in meetings and service. This raises the question: How can we regularly direct interested ones to Jehovah’s organization and his service? To help us, the Society has prepared just what we need. Invite audience to turn to “Make Sure” and heading “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Enough material is provided for almost fifty discussions. Observe the logical sequence: First, consideration is given to our name and origin; next, matters of conduct and what kind of people we are; then what kind of meetings we have and why; this is followed by information on the organization and field ministry. You may choose to consider one heading a week, or several headings may be handled at once, though it is best not to try to handle too much at one time. The point to emphasize is in the heading, which is in boldface type. DEMONSTRATION (3 min.) You might say: “Something I thought you would want to know is why we are called Jehovah’s witnesses. The answer is here in Isaiah 43:10-12.” Read verses and repeat idea expressed in heading in “Make Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (7 min.) Ask audience for comments on how Convention Reports, the “Yearbook,” “Kingdom Ministry,” Theocratic Ministry School Schedule, etc., can be used, along with other headings in “Make Sure,” pages 270-281. It is suggested that subjects be considered just one at a time, according to the need of Bible students. Keep things simple. You may find it appropriate to direct attention to the organization and Jehovah’s service in the above manner before or after your study. Need not limit to after-study discussions. Progress of student will enable you to determine frequency of such discussions, having them each week or less often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Young publisher talks to overseer about the school assignment to write to a “pen pal.” Discuss material according to what is outlined in Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3 min: Accounts report. (Make mention of audit on March 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Concluding comments. Include “How Did We Do in January?” Also, local service report. Mention that it is not too late to fill out a vacation pioneer application for April. Remind publishers to bring “Watchtower” that will be studied next week for part on service meeting program and February insert on pioneering. Song 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Obedient Slave's of Our Repurchaser. Song 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Two publishers discuss Branch letter and Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: “Watchtower” study servant, having met with overseer, offers suggestions to congregation on how to study and prepare comments on lesson to be studied that week. Publishers can be encouraged to bring their own copy to meeting. Show how scriptures cited can be used for comments. Give encouragement to read all articles in magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “A Grand Privilege of Service.” (Question-and-answer coverage of insert on pioneering in February “Kingdom Ministry”; look up scriptures cited; read paragraphs.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Interview at least two publishers in congregation, asking them, “How did you become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” Remind the publishers to help others in service during April. Song 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Joyful Servants of the True God, Jehovah. Song 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “Delighting to Do God’s Will.” Have entire audience look up, read and comment on Acts 13:48, 52. Then discuss article, with questions and answers. Comment on scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">30 min: Aiding Others to Attend the Special Public Talk and the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(13 min.) Chairman gives short talk on article “Talks You Are to Give.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Next, draw comments from audience on why it is that we are particularly interested in getting everyone to attend the Memorial. Let them read scriptures showing its importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Stir up enthusiasm for special April 3 talk, “What Binding Satan the Devil Will Mean for Mankind.” Have several in audience ready to comment along these lines: Until people understand what the Bible says on this matter they blame God for everything, find it difficult to love him and put faith in his promises. Many today are skeptical about existence of Devil. Even those who believe he exists often ask why God does not do something about the situation. This is a vital topic. It will answer many questions in the minds of newly interested ones, if we can aid them to be present and get the truth on this matter clearly in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(17 min.) Subscribers and others who have shown interest should be given personal invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publisher from audience can ask for suggestions on how to go about inviting them. Have audience give suggestions on what to say. Chairman can stress need of keeping things simple, warm and inviting. Publisher inquiring can then demonstrate how a call can be made, showing he appreciates suggestions. Chairman can then discuss prospects, ask who needs help, how we can help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Also, read to congregation titles of new public talks. (Congregation servant has list.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Remind publishers to schedule time so calls can be made on all subscribers, and those studying, etc., to invite them to special meetings. Song 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN APRIL </span><span class="font11">(Or fifth meeting in March)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Strengthened to Faithfulness by Resurrection Hope. Song 35. 10 min: After brief introductory remarks, show family of three discussing day’s text. Father calls on son to tell the family two or three main points that stood out in his mind on theme for the month. (Draw them from the article in the April 1, 1966, “Watchtower”; use a scripture.) Mother adds that she read a “Yearbook” experience (p. 178, par. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">2)</span><span class="font11"> that nicely illustrates the theme; relates it. 20 min: Presenting the Good News. Talk and demonstration on article “Presenting the Good News by Teaching with Authority.” Help audience to see “why” and “how” attention can be focused on Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Aiding Others to Praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(7 min.) Chairman comments on scriptures at Matthew 5:14, 16 and Acts 20:24. Encouragement is then given to aid all who have previously shared in service to do so during April and following months. They have shown a desire to serve Jehovah; let’s help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ask study conductor, “When does your group meet for service?” Let him outline program. Ask those who meet for midweek service to comment from audience on when and where they meet. Ascertain if there is anyone who would like to go out with one of these groups. Encourage publishers to think, “Who is there in your group that needs help?” “Why not call and offer help?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What about those with whom we study? Are there some who are ready for service? Do they know the New World society’s Scriptural standards on morals, separateness from false religious and political affairs, and are their personal circumstances in harmony with those standards? If so, invite them to go with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(6 min.) Publisher in audience asks for suggestions on how to do it. Invited to platform. It is pointed out that “Make Sure” could be left with householder one week, requesting that he read the section on “Preaching the Good News.” Next week highlight a point from it and invite him along to see how the work is done. It may be that after a few doors he will want to say something. If you discern that to be the case, then spend a few minutes helping him to prepare a short presentation. Demonstrate how to handle in a natural, friendly way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Our goal is to have new publisher continue participation in Kingdom service after April, so before separating, it will be profitable to analyze what was accomplished that day in a positive way. Demonstrate how, after service, publisher, using Matthew 10:12-14, shows that differing reactions were expected, but we are doing as Jesus said we should and witness is being accomplished. Enjoyed companionship and hope to do it again soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) Conclude with comments on privilege of serving Jehovah. Our attaining the 20-percent goal will be a reflection of the efforts we put forth to aid others to praise Jehovah. 10 min: Concluding comments. Include item on ‘Good News for Every Tongue.’ Song 41.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Talks You Are to Give</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> You brothers who' have been assigned to give public talks in the series beginning April 10 will be interested to know that the new outlines will be quite extensive. They are not simply outlines from which to do research; they are fully prepared outlines from which you can speak, though you may want to copy them on a typewriter for the sake of a larger type. Nevertheless, careful preparation on youi<sup>-</sup> part is vital. Many of these talks include quite a bit of the “meat” of the Word. Be sure that you thoroughly understand it so you can help the audience to reason on it clearly. Also, work in appropriate illustrations that fit your particular audience. Practice yoUr delivery to make it coherent and stimulating. And if your talk calls for some form of audience participation, be sure to plan this carefully in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Some of you will be delivering the Memorial talk on April 5, too, and that is both a serious responsibility and a great privilege. No new outline is being provided for this talk, but we would like to encourage you to use some personal initiative to make it the best talk that you give during the year. While this talk is weighty and certain basic points must be covered, be careful not to make it so technical that it fails to convey the spirit of the occasion. It should be spiritually uplifting and heartwarming. Keep in mind that there are many newly interested ones who</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Good News for Every Tongue’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How did you feel when you first got the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’ </span><span class="font12">book? It was a thrilling experience, wasn’t it? And, truly, all of us have been delighted to study it and place it with others. We are happy to say that copy for the Norwegian edition has been received and is being set on the linotype. We are pleased to let you know too that the linotypes have now finished setting copy for the Danish, Swedish and Afrikaans editions, and the proofreaders are now checking this. We will let you know as soon as these may be ordered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> So far the response to the new book has been excellent. One sister wrote the Society, “So much wonderful spiritual food has been found in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font12"> book that it is just impossible to keep them around long enough to warm the book shelves.” Let’s keep sharing the new book with persons of as many languages as possible. It has good news for every tribe, people and tongue.—Rev. 14: 6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">will be present. When preparing, you might ask yourself: “Will my coverage of this material be clear enough to those present for the first time? Will they discern the meaning of the bread and the wine and understand just who should partake and that those who do take the emblems partake of both the bread and the wine? When I finish, will all in the audience appreciate the real purpose and spirit of the occasion?” Much fine material in connection with the Memorial has been published in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">in recent years, and you may be able to put some of it to good use. So that all will run smoothly, do not forget to review details of the meeting, such as the serving of emblems and arrangements for prayer, and do so with the overseer well ahead of time.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Will You Have Enough?</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Yes, you will have enough if you have ordered them well In advance. But have you? Have you placed your order with the magazine-territory servant for additional copies of the special April 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and the special April 22 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> as you might have guessed, will feature the public talk that we are all planning to hear on April 3: “What Binding Satan the Devil Will Mean for Mankind.” We all plan to work hard to bring newly interested ones to that meeting, because we know that this will accomplish much more than if they simply read it at home. But the fact is that tens of thousands of persons In your territory will not be on hand to hear the talk, yet they need the Information. If only they would take a little time to consider it, it could mean their starting on the way to life. Can we help them? Yes, we know we can—by leaving them a personal copy of the talk to read at home. Will you have enough copies for them? Be sure you do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What about the special </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!? </span><span class="font12">What is it featuring this time? Well, you will be interested to know that the theme is “Your Life and Bible Prophecy.” As for details, we are going to let you find out when you receive your own copy. But we are sure you will enjoy it, and we feel confident that you will find it easy to place with the public. Be sure to order enough now so you will not run short.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> During April most of us will be planning to spend more of our service time in magazine distribution, because we want to give these special issues a wide distribution. Congregation publishers will be striving to place 30 copies; pioneers, 200; special pioneers, 300. And what about vacation pioneers? Well, if you plan to devote a full month to pioneering, why not try for the pioneer goal of 200? Or if, as a two-week pioneer, you are reaching out for 75 hours, you may want to set your goal at 150. At any rate, we suggest that the magazine-territory servant check with each publisher within the next few days to find out how many extra copies of the April issues, particularly the special ones, each one feels that he can use. Then mail that order soon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you just tell us how many you can use, we at Bethel will be glad to do bur part. We’ll be glad to run the presses just as many hours as necessary to make sure that you do have enough magazines for April’s special activity.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By Teaching with Authority</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many of us these days have the grand privilege of assisting and training newer and less-experienced publishers to become more effective ministers. Are we showing them how to teach with authority? Is our example of teaching patterned after the greatest Teacher of all time, Jesus Christ? He taught with authority because he used the Scriptures. We today can actually open the Bible and let people see for themselves what it says. The Society recommends that you do this on your studies, looking up and reading particularly the scriptures that are cited but not quoted. When you are newly starting a study, for a few weeks you might even want to look up in the Bible those texts that are fully quoted in the publications being studied. In this way you focus principal attention on the Bible itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For example, when teaching another publisher how to conduct a progressive study in one of the booklets, some of our brothers have done this: Instead of just discussing the answer to a question and then referring to the scriptures cited, they actually look up all the scriptures in the Bible. They ask the householder to get his Bible and then read the scriptures cited right from the Bible, with impressive results. In many cases this has made a tremendous difference In the respect that the one being studied with has for God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Delighting to Do God's Will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">mind toward Jehovah and his people than when we found them, or that a good foundation was laid for a witness to be given the next time someone calls, then we have accomplished a fine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We have what the people In our territory need. Jehovah has wonderfully trained us to provide spiritual assistance to sheeplike ones. When we see such persons being drawn closer to Jehovah’s organization as a result of our efforts, even though their progress may be quite slow, it does bring us great satisfaction and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> sense of accomplishment. We have every reason to rejoice and can be certain that Jehovah is well pleased with our diligent efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To illustrate, if we are studying paragraph four at the top of page five in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom,&quot;</span><span class="font12"> we might be inclined just to refer to John 17:17 and 2 Timothy 3:15-17. But if we actually open our Bible and invite the student to do the same and then have him read the scriptures, this will impress on his mind that he is having a study in the Bible and not just a study in the booklet. Yes, if we focus attention on the Bible, then we will be teaching with greater authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If, in starting studies on the initial call, we say that we are encouraging Bible study, then it would be good to get into the Bible as soon as possible and briefly refer to the booklet or book so they will see where the information is being obtained. In this way it will truly be a study in the Bible as far as the householder is concerned and not a study in only a book or a booklet. In the mind of the householder this will surely build up confidence in Jehovah’s Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The clergy of Christendom often say the Bible says this or that, but, of course, very often it doesn’t. Householders may think that we are the same as the clergy unless we actually show them and they can see for themselves what the Bible teaches. Truly, this will aid us to teach with authority.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Though severe winter weather buffeted many parts of the country, nevertheless, you brothers kept busy in the ministry and much fine work was accomplished. Many found the inclement weather a fine time to make back-calls and start Bible studies. Publishers averaged .6 Bible studies, vacation pioneers 2.5, pioneers 5.1 and special pioneers 7.8. All together, 235,479 studies were conducted. It is fine to see the good attention that you are giving to these home Bible studies, because this is the most effective means to aid sheeplike persons to become praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• Is it proper to write to the Society or its branch offices for addresses of persons we can write to as “pen pals”? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We recommend that publishers who wish to correspond with brothers in other cities and even in foreign countries work such matters out for themselves. Oftentimes many fine friendships have resulted from acquaintances made at assemblies. Then by means of regular correspondence it has been possible to develop a warm, enduring friendship. There is nothingwrong in such personal correspondence. However, addresses for such correspondence purposes must be obtained on an individual basis. All the addresses in the Society’s files and in congregation files are confidential and they cannot be released for personal use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some schools encourage correspondence with “pen pals” as training in certain courses. In some instances younger publishers have witnessed effectively by means of correspondence and have succeeded in stimulating genuine interest in the truth. It is up to each individual, however, to decide if he will participate in such a school-sponsored program of letter writing. Those who do write to worldly persons, however, do well to keep in mind giving a Kingdom witness rather than cultivating an interest in worldly affairs, in view of the warning against “bad associations” given at 1 Corinthians 15:33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. IX NO. 5</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QW (ptibMeftS:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">We’re a singing family! We have been for some time now, but we could not tell you about it. You probably received a letter about our new songbook, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Singing and Accompanying Yourselves with Music in Your Hearts.&quot;</span><span class="font12"> For some months now we have been singing these new songs with music in our hearts, and we have already heard some' of the recorded music on phonograph records. It Is simply beautiful ! Did you ever feel tingling going up and down your back when you were singing a beautiful melody with words that were full of meaning? That is what happens to us when we sing these new songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Remember to take your new songbook along with you to the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly. You will need it, because the songs sung there will be from this new songbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O yes, another exciting thing happened here since we last wrote you. All the family saw the new film the Society has made entitled “Heritage.” All the actors in it are Jehovah’s witnesses. We enjoyed it very much. When you see it over TV, it will make you think. It carries a powerful message, but if it is going to do people the most good, we will have to follow through with Bible studies to help them get on the right path, the one that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By now you no doubt have decided which convention you will he attending. Quite a number of us in the Bethel family are going to Toronto. That is the first one on this continent, you know. Probably the greater part of the family will be going to Baltimore, though, as that is the nearest one for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How do you like the title of the public talk for the assembly, “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?” What a question! It gets one’s mind to working, and there are a lot of things that one can think of that God’s kingdom has done since 1914. But still we wonder how that question will be treated when the public comes to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Brothers Need</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Already it is time to start thinking about our work for May. Our thoughts may well focus on the many new ones we helped to get started in the field service in April. We would certainly like to see all of them keep on in Kingdom service. But not all do. In fact, here at the Society’s office we have made a few calculations in which we believe you will be interested. During the last service year, for every two new publishers added to the ranks, one became inactive. This makes us think, doesn’t it? We naturally wonder if there is anything more that we can do to help these persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We believe that with many who become inactive the solution centers around the home Bible study; that Is, continuing the study with them after they start in the field service, yes, even after dedication. When we get to the heart of the matter, isn’t what they really need an accurate knowledge of the truth? Of course, you may be thinking, ‘But how can I keep on studying with them now that they are dedicated? How will I keep up my service report?’ In answer, we ought hear it. We here are all keyed up about the assembly and anxious to go. If what is said at the assembly is anything like the new sohgbook, then certainly it will be an assembly of praise to Jehovah. We are sure it will be and that every one of you attending will have hearts welling up with praise. We will have a happy time together. Remember incidental witnessing along the way to and from the convention. Let’s keep preaching and telling everyone the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you as you sing with music in your hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With warm love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font12">PS: Songs to be used at the assemblies this summer are listed on page 3. Why not practice some of them in your meetings before then?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Help</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">to look at it this way: While it is true that having a good personal field-service report is desirable, is it really more important than to help someone who has already shown a desire to serve Jehovah?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> You undoubtedly answer that it is more Important to assist our dedicated brothers, and that is right. In fact, what is it that Jesus said would be the distinguishing feature of his true followers? While preaching the good news is one of the very important features, we know that the outstanding feature that Jesus said would distinguish his followers is love for one another. (John 13: 35) Do we love our brothers as much as the ones on whom we call at their door, many of whom refuse to listen? If so, we certainly should find time to provide a few hours of additional help a month for these many new and weak ones in the fold. If we can render this help and still make the goal of ten hours, that is fine, and usually that is possible; but if we have to make a choice, then our first obligation would be to our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Of course, we also want to make time to do house-to-house work in May, and we have as the suggested offer the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.”</span><span class="font12"> Thofigh this book was published some years ago, you know, perhaps from your own case, that it has helped many new ones into the truth. It may have been one of the books that did much to make over your mind in harmony with the divine will. Its chapter 14, on marriage, is just one of many that help persons adjust their lives to God’s requirements. So why not get all the copies of this book off the shelf and put them in the hands of the people? If you do not have any left, then use any other bound book you might have on hand; and as you share in the service, perhaps you can invite others who need encouragement to go with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: &quot;Serving with Constancy” Is Life-preserving. (Dan. 6:16) Song 1. 15 min: Introduction, text and comments. As text is concluded, a family or several publishers leave their seats and start for platform. Brother handling part greets them and invites them to come up and share some good news from the Brooklyn branch office. They then have lively discussion of branch letter and make application to the local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: &quot;Your Brothers Need Help.” Questions and answers on main article. Have all look up scripture and ask for comments on it. Also, discuss article entitled &quot;Its New!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Many Enjoy an Added Privilege—Can You Too?” Overseer or other servant comments on article; then calls on pioneers, vacation pioneers and other publishers who had 'good experiences during April to relate them. Plan carefully in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3 min: Accounts report for April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments. &quot;How Did We Do in March?” Local April report. May report to date. Comment briefly on meeting theme and its Scriptural setting. Song 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: &quot;Not the Sort That Shrink Back” Under Opposition. (Heb. 10:39) Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Introduction, text and comments. Theocratic News. A discussion between two or three publishers highlighting how the Theocratic News encourages us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Bearing Up Under Persecution. Consideration of information in article &quot;Portugal Continues to Persecute Jehovah’s Witnesses” from “Awake!” of February 22, 1966, and article, “Where Prisoners Guard Themselves” in “Awake!” of March 22, 1966. In three-minute introduction chairman can use appropriate scriptures under heading “Persecution” in “Make Sure” to show that persecution can be expected in this “time of the end.” In various parts of the world our brothers are being persecuted and, in some instances, very severely mistreated because of their faith. Reports from Portugal are sobering. We do not want to read such articles hastily and overlook their import. We are concerned for our brothers and we want to learn from their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Following this introduction, two publishers can relate experiences from the article on Portugal and one publisher can briefly tell of the integrity of our brothers in Sweden and how they have a favorable report from authorities even though some are being restrained from doing their ministerial work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then for about six minutes comments can be drawn from the audience on how we can benefit from these experiences, how the Scriptures are thus being fulfilled, and how consideration of what our brothers are going through will prepare us for persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman can be instrumental in making this whole presentation very upbuilding and stimulating to our brothers. Concluding remarks can summarize briefly how information is beneficial to us. We should not forget our brothers. Especially when they are undergoing hardships we should by all means include them in our prayers. 15 min: “Do You Use It Wisely?” Opening scene: A group of publishers in pantomime act out ideas in paragraphs 1-4, with the setting being the .service center^ oil _. Sunday </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mornings </span><span class="font10">Chairman comments on scene as it develops. Publishers come in one and two at a time after meeting for service has started. After few minutes, group leaves as if going to field. Chairman then talks on paragraph 2. Paragraphs 3-5 may be handled by questions and answers. Conclude by discussing paragraph 6. While wrong tendencies are here discussed and portrayed to show what habits we can allow ourselves to slip into, the approach should be a positive one, rather than giving the appearance of being critical. Show how much better it is and how it is showing love when we come on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Announcement about certificate for Selective Service boards. Song 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Prepare to Handle the Truth Aright. (2 Tim. 2:15) Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: A suggested sermon for June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman: Belief in Bible becoming less in religious world today. Need to show people Bible is God’s Word, is reliable, foretells man’s future accurately. Gives hope of everlasting life in a new , earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: The Bible Tells the Truth Concerning Man’s Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Isa. 46:9, 10—Jehovah has foretold the future in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">John 17:17—Jesus recommended the Bible as truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">2 Pet. 3:13—Righteous new system of things foretold to replace present wicked system</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(12 min.) Family or group of publishers prepare new sermon together, with brother leading very lively discussion, following general thoughts as expressed below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) One in group gives model sermon. This approach may be used: ‘The reason I have stopped by today is to bring you some good news. Today man’s future looks quite gloomy because of the war, so much sickness, famine in many lands [use loc'al conditions] and it seems every family has some problem. People sometimes wonder if their future will ever get any better, don’t they? [Allow to comment.] While we can’t tell for sure what is going to happen even an hour in advance, the Bible is the book that tells the truth concerning man’s future. Note how clearly this is explained at Isaiah 46:9, 10. [Read and comment.] These things that God says he will do are recorded in the Bible, and we can have confidence in it because it is impossible for God to lie. Jesus knew this, and at John 17:17 he said . . . [Read]. This Word of truth, the Bible, tells us that, after God destroys this present wicked system of things, he will bless Godfearing persons with life in a righteous new system, and this new system of things is promised here at 2 Peter 3:13 . . . [Read]. We want to be included among those who live in that righteous new system of things, don’t we? [Allow householder to answer.] To obtain that blessing, we need to learn what the Bible says for the guidance of all of us now. [Make offer of Bible and “Impossible to Lie” book.]’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Emphasize that, when we call on people at their homes, our real desire is to study the Bible with them. In house-to-house work, we may discuss that with householders right at the outset; or we may do it after giving the sermon. But in calling at every door, keep that goal of a home Bible study in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: “Are You Ready?” Cover the article by questions and answers. Tie in announcement on lapel cards, celluloid holders and bumper signs. Include comments from May 15, 1966, “Watchtower” on “A Wise Person Will Listen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Question Box. Discussion between two publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Announcement of arrangements for special Magazine Day activity on May 30. Also appropriate comments on slogan, page 4. Song 55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Inviting Hungry Ones to God’s Banquet for All Peoples. (Isa. 25:6) Song 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text and comments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">15 min: Presenting the Good News —“Do You Let ‘Make Sure’ Help You?” A combination discussion and demonstration to show the value of having “Make Sure” with us in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Discuss May 15 “Watchtower” article “A New Songbook!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">13 min: Closing comments. Song 107.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MARCH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” (2 Cor. 9:6) Our March report certainly illustrates the truthfulness of this scripture. How so? Well, we had another new peak of home Bible studies. Yes, 244,786 were conducted, an increase of 4,447 over February. The fact that we spent more time in the ministry and made more back-calls no doubt contributed much to this. Our average hours and back-calls, as well as magazine placements, came up very nicely, even though there was considerable sickness in some areas. How good it is to see all of you giving so generously of yourselves in the Christian ministry! Truly this is a labor of love, a real evidence of love for Jehovah and neighbor, which stands out in refreshing contrast to this system of things. May all of us continue bearing thorough witness as Jesus and Paul did, helping many more to embrace the way that leads to life.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Use It Wisely?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “He’s always here well ahead of time. Something must have happened to make him late!” Is this the way others comment when unavoidable circumstances prevent you from keeping an appointment on time despite your good planning and foresight? Or, when you are late, do they say to themselves: “He’ll get here eventually. He’s always ten minutes or so late”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Circuit servant reports indicate that at times service center groups get started late in the service because of tardiness on the part of some in the group. We don’t want this to happen, do we? As dedicated Christians it is Important for us to use our time wisely.—Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Being </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">habitually</span><span class="font12"> late at meetings for service generally shows lack of loving consideration for others, doesn’t it? In most cases scheduling and good planning in advance will enable us to be punctual. How can we do this in a practical way? Well, let’s ask ourselves some questions. Do we cooperate with one another in the family so all can be ready on time?' Or, if another publisher kindly arranges to pick us up for service, are we ready when he arrives? Or, for that matter, are we on time to pick up someone else? Are we equipped in advance with literature so we can go right into the field ministry immediately after the meeting for field service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As a study conductor, do you start and end the meeting for field service on time? If you are prone to wait for latecomers, why not start on time? True, unavoidable circumstances will occasionally delay some, and we do want to show loving consideration. On the other hand, we also want to be considerate of those who are punctual. If any in your group are consistently late, it would be a loving thing to speak to them privately, encouraging them to be on time, doing so kindly, not in a critical spirit. Should the need arise on occasion, a note could be left at the service center for the benefit of the latecomers, telling them where Ilie group is witnessing.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ At the service centers during May these suggestions for the meetings for field service may be used: Week of May 8, review a simplified sermon, using Revelation 21: 4, 5 or John 17:3 or other appropriate text. May 15, review sermon “The Bible’s Promise of a Better System of Things.” Publishers may use whatever sermon they prefer. May 22, suggestions for starting studies with those who have obtained literature. May 29, review purpose of House-to-House Record and give helpful suggestions on filling it out. June 5, review suggested sermon for June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ All those planning to take one of the Society’s assembly tours to Central or South America should have sent their applications to the Society by May 1. Anyone who has requested the application forms but has not turned them in should do so </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font10"> if he plans to take one of the tours. The Society must know </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font10"> how many definitely plan to take the Central and South American trips. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ These are the numbers of songs to be sung at the conventions this summer: 1, 5, 10, 20, 24, 25, 39, 41, 51, 55, 62, 63, 65, 66, 75, 78, 85, 89, 92, 100, 107, 118, 119.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Monday, May 30. Memorial Day, will be a fine day for special Magazine Day activity. Some congregations may have cemeteries in their territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The meeting for field service includes a brief discussion of the daily text and field points often suggested in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> as well as prayer. Before the group is dismissed the study conductor can also make assignments of territory and arrange for the making of back-calls, if that has not already been done. Thus, all can leave for the field promptly after dismissal. Afternoon and prestudy meetings for field service may be very brief and need not include the daily text.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> How, then, can we make wise use of our time? One way is cultivating promptness at meetings for field service. Get into the habit of being on time, in fact, early. In addition to showing consideration to others, this will give us more time to preach the good news.—Acts 14: 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">they will want to visit, offering magazines and appropriate tracts. The May 22 Awake! will contain the article “Can the Dead Be Restored to Life?’’ ♦ Literature offer for June: The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,**</span><span class="font10"> with two 32-page booklets, on a contribution of $1.50. July and August: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> and a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Congregations interested in unassigned territory should submit their requests before May 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Regular pioneers, males, who have served at least three months and met minimum hour requirements of 100 hours each month, on an average, may obtain from the Society a certificate to file with Selective Service boards in support of their claim for classification as a minister by writing to Watchtower Society, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201. Appointed servants who need it may also write for a certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Assembly lapel cards can be obtained in English and Spanish for 1 cent each. Publishers and pioneers will appreciate it very much if congregation servants make sure that each one has one before leaving for the assembly, because none will be avail-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Are You Ready?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In just a few short weeks the 1966 district assemblies will begin. Are you ready for them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Brothers, by all means plan to be present. There are matters that will be presented at these assemblies that every one of Jehovah’s people will want to hear. They affect you and your ministry, and, as the remaining time before the end of the present wicked system of things grows shorter, it is increasingly urgent for us not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together.—Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">3 jr<sub>or</sub> your convenience, Room Request forms have been sent to your congregation, and we suggest that they be discussed at the service meeting six to eight weeks prior to the assembly in your area. Don’t forget that the form is to be mailed to the city where you plan to attend, and not to the Society. Volunteer Service forms also have been supplied, and these can be submitted along with the Room Request forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Enjoy an Added Privilege—Can You Too?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> April is proving to be a month filled with joyful service to Jehovah. Being a pioneer has added to the joy of many. Over 9,000 have shared in regular pioneer service; close to 800 in special pioneer work and by April 15 over 18,000 had applied to have a part in vacation pioneer service. Now, add to that all the excellent activity of the other nearly 300,000 Kingdom publishers in the United States and you can begin to sense how busy Jehovah’s people are, how many happy experiences they are enjoying and the grand shout of praise that is going up to Jehovah’s honor. Aren’t you glad to have a part?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> But back to the matter of pioneering. Vacation pioneering is something you can share in any time during the year. Is summer a good time for you? Have a share in this inspiring service for two weeks or longer whenever you can. Perhaps being a vacation pioneer will prove to you that regular pioneer service is possible. The thousands who have been joyfully serving full time for 10, 20, 30, yes, even 40 years and more invite you to join them as a pioneer. They rejoice in this added privilege of service. Can you too?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Let “Make Sure” Help You?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many fine letters have come In from the brothers In all parts of the country, saying in one way or another: “How grateful , I am for the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Hake Sure’!</span><span class="font12"> So often, when a question has come up in the ministry, I have reached into my bag to get </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Make Sure’</span><span class="font12"> and almost immediately found just the scriptures I needed to give an answer.” It is good to know that you are enjoying it. Many of you may have wished that you had time to sit down and become better acquainted with what’s in it; so let’s just take time to consider a portion together on the service meeting. It will do all of us good.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Suppose someone has expressed himself strongly in favor of the Trinity. How many scriptures could you find to help him? Perhaps several on the spur of the moment, but don’t you often find that later you remember points that you wish you had used? Here is where </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure”</span><span class="font12"> comes in, because the points are always there, ready for use. Let’s try it out.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In as few seconds as it takes you to turn to the section on “Trinity” you are equipped to present a thorough discussion of the subject. Whether you turn to the listing of subjects in the front, or the Index in the back, you will be referred to page 484, where this section begins. Of course, the Trinity is</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During the past few days the Society has been preparing an attractive four-page folder for your use in the ministry. It stimulates interest in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font12"> and invites people to order it and to avail themselves of the free home Bible study service offered by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Ten million of these folders are being printed, and we will send some to your congregation, free of charge, along with your songbook order. There will be about thirty for each publisher, but please do not order more. For now, that’s all we have. not a Bible teaching. So the book quotes those who do teach it to show what they say. There are both Catholic and Protestant statements of belief. The material that follows shows just how those statements of belief are contrary to the Bible, and the Bible translations quoted, you will observe, are the ones that are used by those who believe in the Trinity. You will find it most persuasive to start right at the beginning, taking each subheading in turn, and using as many scriptures as you feel are necessary to support each point. The scriptures used by Trinitarians in their effort to prove the Trinity are Included too. For example, on page 487, John 10: 30 is set right alongside John 17: 20-22, making clear- its meaning. What about the Trinitarian statement at 1 John 5:7? Starting on page 488, you will find proof for both Protestants and Catholics showing that it is spurious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> All this information is right at your fingertips ; powerful scriptures are assembled for powerful argument. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure&quot;</span><span class="font12"> can be used to answer quickly and persuasively almost any doctrinal objection that you will meet. But this is its defensive use. It can also be used to clarify doctrinal truths and explain the Scriptural basis for the theocratic organization and the way in which we carry on our ministry. As you use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure”</span><span class="font12"> we feel that you will find it to be a great help in presenting the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> These are meant to be left at homes where you know people are living but where no one is at home when you call. By using them well during May and June, it should be possible for us to reach the people in ten million homes where we otherwise would not be able to give a witness. They do not take the place of the handbills; you may leave both the folder and the handbill under the doors of not-at-homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When anyone in your territory responds to the folder and orders the new book or requests a home Bible study, we will let you know so that you can follow up on the interest. It will be interesting to see what results we get.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font10">* When is it in order to contribute for transportation supplied by others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The principle to keep in mind in this regard is that love “does not look for its own interests.” &lt;1 Cor. 13:5) So when we enjoy the transportation facilities of others on a regular basis, it is always fitting for us to offer a reasonable contribution to help in covering expenses. Since the car owner is the one providing the transportation, he may be asked what contribution he would like. So it is fitting to discuss the matter with the car driver and for him to let his wish be known. A definite agreement does help to avoid any misunderstandings. Some brothers just leave the agreed-upon contribution in the ash tray of the auto. Even though we might tend to feel in some instances that the car owner may not need the contribution, the<sup>:</sup> loving thing is to offer to contribute. Of course, in some cases a car owner may make it known he does not desire any contribution, and it is proper to heed his wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The car owner, of course, should use discernment in the matter of contributions. Some persons do not have much in a material way and may not be able to get to meetings if they have to pay the regular bus fares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In certain areas those in need of transportation live some distance from the Kingdom Hall. It is a loving service on the part of those who do have transportation facilities to plan their affairs to help those who might not otherwise be able to attend meetings or share in the service. In this matter, as in all others, let us discern what would be the loving thing &gt;&nbsp;to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“We should no! neglect the house of our God.&quot;—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The past service year has been an Interesting one for all of us, and we feel built up' spiritually as a result of it. What was accomplished in the field service during the year? Much good work! On an average, 3,000 more persons joined us in the preaching work each month than in the previous year; that is a 1-percent increase. Also, 14,163 got baptized, and, of course, we want to aid them to be regular praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though we spent 80,000 fewer hours in the service, still 48,647,551 hours were devoted to the field ministry, and that has resulted in a tremendous witness to the name and purpose of our God. Furthermore, on the part of most of you that service represents careful planning and earnest devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here in the United States we distributed 56,191,950 copies of the magazines this past year, and, while that is down somewhat from last year, still it represents 11.2 monthly for publishers, 97 for pioneers and 140.6 for special pioneers, and each one placed has great faithbuilding potential. Our report also shows that we obtained 105,000 fewer subscriptions this past year, probably because books were being emphasized, but we did have a wonderful time with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font10"> book. There were 430,000 more books placed than the year before, and that is the best in twenty years! It also opened the way for more new home Bible studies, which are a vital part of our work. From 225,033 studies in 1965 we went up to 233,580, on an average, in 1966. Very fine indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, some are wondering why our Increase was not as great as during past years. It may be that Brother Knorr pointed to the answer when he spoke to 23,664 gathered in Los Angeles in September, and again in Pittsburgh when he talked to 2,977 on the same subject at the Watch Tower Society’s annual meeting on October 1. Basing his comments on Isaiah chapter six, I</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Fine Instrument!</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Yes, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font10"> is indeed another fine Instrument, for us and for others! Have you heard some comments on it? We have. “Once you pick it up and start reading it, it’s hard to put it down.” “This should make all feel a sense of urgency.” “I have read it through once, but I must read it again.” “This book has substance, surely it will build up the spirituality of our brothers in these final days.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Have you read it yet? If not, why not do so as soon as possible? Remember, it is another fine instrument for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">us.</span><span class="font10"> Here is “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45) There is only one way to transform that spiritual food to spiritual strength and that is by partaking of it. True, we will be studying it at our book studies when we finish our current publication, but why wait until then before benefiting from such strengthening food? Rather, why not give up something less important so as to get it read as quickly as possible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> And now we have the opportunity to enable </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">others</span><span class="font10"> to benefit from this fine instrument. During he showed that in Isaiah’s day Jehovah told the prophet that the response of people to his preaching would be refusal to see or hear or open their hearts so that they could get healed. Perhaps we today are getting to the time when that is again true to a greater extent than in recent years, he said. But still Jehovah instructs us to keep on preaching, telling them again and again. We must not let their hard hearts cause our love to lessen; we want to continue to be zealous in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">We pray that Jehovah will bless you as you do just that during this new service year, declaring the good news without letup even though the majority do not respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With warm love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Oitice</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">November we can concentrate on offering the new book to all in our territory. What will they find as they begin to read? The most encouraging information for those who long for freedom! Our book shows them from the Bible how true freedom can be had. It shows that man needs to be freed from things outside and inside the body. He needs to be freed from religious bondage and the influence of unseen spirit forces, as well as human imperfection, sin and death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When you are presenting the book it would be good to be prepared to refei<sup>-</sup> to something specific that would Illustrate its value. For example, one might read the opening paragraph on page 5. Or, we might refer to the fine illustration on the opening page and comment on the freedom that God has in mind for lovers of righteousness in a paradise earth. Some have opened to page 219 and explained that the chapter “God’s Gift of Marriage” outlines God’s instructions for a happy married life. This has caught the attention of those who appreciate that marital problems Sre increasing and that man’s counsel has not offered the solution. After highlighting this chapter and placing the book, one brother said, “If she reads nothing but that chapter, placing the book with her will have been worth while, although I hope she continues on and reads the rest.” ■Sermons and comments can be flexible, in harmony with what you decide to highlight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Are there others who might appreciate the opportunity to obtain the new book? What about friends and relatives? Many of them have our other publications. It could well be that the new book is just what they need to spark their interest and help them toward life everlasting. And what about those on whom we are making back-calls and those with whom we are con-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Pay Attention to Your Teaching-. (1 Tim. 4:16) Song 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Branch letter. Two study conductors consider material together and, where possible, make application of points to their groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Are You Building Properly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Bible study servant has analyzed his file and has information and suggestions that will be of value to the brothers. He points out the number of Bible studies being conducted, how many have been held for more than six months, a year, two years, in what publications they are conducted, number conducted one time a month, two times, etc., also shows how many are family studies, that is, publishers studying with their own children, and how often these are conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of us should be concerned with conducting studies regularly and making progress. How are our students progressing? Are they coming to an accurate knowledge of the truth? Do they understand how the truth applies to them and what they must do? Are they coming to congregation meetings? If not, why? Is there anything we as teachers can do to improve? We do not want to conduct a study as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. We want to be purposeful. (Gal. 6:6) We want our students to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth, begin to attend meetings and begin to serve in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) At this point publisher from audience asks how one can tell if he is getting results and effectively teaching. He is invited to platform - and servant discusses following points with him: Does the student answer in his own words? Could he explain the point to someone else? Does he know how the thought applies to him and what action he should take on the matter? Can he use the Bible to back up his understanding? Does he see how the truth of the matter is different from what is taught in false religion? Servant invites publisher to observe how some of these points are demonstrated by another publisher on the other side of the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(8 min.) A capable publisher demonstrates possibly two or three of the above points, selecting the points thought needed in your territory, while conducting a Bible study. The Bible study servant interrupts and the study stops after each point is made and he briefly comments on it and discusses it with the publisher who is observing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Chairman exhorts all to conduct studies regularly and purposefully, including family studies, making them interesting. Be sure student understands, can answer in his own words, knows how material applies to him, and is different from false teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Another Fine Instrument!” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Consider congregation service report for October and “How Did We Do in September?” Comment on advisability of inviting those with whom home Bible studies are being conducted to meetings now so they might possibly share in field service in December as we work for 10-percent increase. Song 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: “Stand Firm in the Faith.” (1 Cor. 16:13) Song 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 25 min: Neutral Christians in Portugal. Base this material on “The Watchtower” of October 1, 1966, page 587 112, through page 589 fl5., Prepare questions on the paragraphs and study them with the congregation, having paragraphs read in summary. You may combine some paragraphs, if you want to. The one in charge of this part should be a mature brother; he should not take it upon himself to tell the congregation or individuals in it what they should do as to military service or other work as a substitute for it. Simply study what the brothers in Portugal did and the reasons they gave for their position. Each individual must decide for himself what course he is going to follow in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: An encouraging talk can be developed around the following “1966 Yearbook” experiences to be found on page 132 fl2; page 135 fll, 2; page 137 Ifl, 2; page 141 Hl, 2; and page 151 Hl, 2. Have a brief introduction and conclusion on the theme, “Setting a Fine Example.” Help publishers to appreciate that the Bible is right in pointing out how one’s faithfulness can draw his marriage mate to the truth. This can be very encouraging to many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Starting Studies with “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman mentions that we have had one month to use October 8 “Awake!” with article designed to start home Bible studies. How is our congregation doing? Are we using it to the best advantage? Let’s hear from publishers who have enjoyed good experiences in using “Awake!” to start home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) One or two encouraging experiences. Prepare this well in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Review November 8 “Awake!” article designed to start home Bible studies, offering suggestions on how studies might be started. Review some of the suggestions given in October “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman encourages all to take advantage of new feature in “Awake!” for starting home Bible studies. We place many magazines in the field and so will now want to take advantage of these many opportunities and use them to start home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Concluding comments. Appropriate items from Announcements. Mention service arrangements for “Thanksgiving Day.” Song 79.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Build on a Solid Foundation. (1 Cor. 3:10) Song 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Question Box. Talk. Draw audience into discussion on main points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Qualifying to Be a Preacher of the Good News.” Discussion among three mature brothers, possibly committee, covering high points of article in the November 1, 1966, “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Christian Neutrals in Portugal and Sweden. Study with the congregation information in “The Watchtower” for October 1, 1966, page 589 fl6 through page 591 112; also “Awake!” for September 22, 1966, page 21 If 1-6. In conclusion the chairman can briefly relate the points under the subheading “The Question of Identification.” This part should be handled by the same brother who was assigned to the part on “Neutral Christians in Portugal,” in the previous service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Appropriate items from Theocratic News. Song 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Helping Others to Find God to Be True. (Rom. 3:4) Song 61.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Talk on month’s theme. See December 1, 1966, “Watchtower.” Also include some points on the text and comments for the day. Experiences from “1966 Yearbook,” page 135 112, 3, and page 152 115, niight be included. 15 min: “What View Do You Take?” Questions and answers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: “Taking In and Giving Out.” Talk by capable brother on material under the heading “Presenting the Good News.” He can draw audience into discussion by a few questions on main points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: ‘Handle the Word of the Truth Aright.’—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">(5 min.) Chairman gives talk on points about and reasons for the “New World Translation” and “Life Everlasting” book. (Choice, pointed thoughts might be taken from the article “Bible Knowledge Made Plain Through Modern Translation” in the October 15, 1961, “Watchtower.”) One half of this talk should deal with the Bible, the other half with the book. Mention that any sermon may be used, but for those desiring to use “Life Everlasting in a Better System of Things,” call on a well-prepared publisher to concisely summarize it without actually giving the sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Publisher gives summary of sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Two well-prepared publishers demonstrate making the offer. One features the Bible along with the book; the other highlights the book along with the Bible. The demonstrations begin at the point where they have just concluded their sermons. They each use a choice talking point or two from the literature in presenting the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman points out that an effort can be made to start Bible study or to make arrangements for a back-call if possible. Comments on importance of thoroughly preparing both sermon and literature presentation. Thus, householder has opportunity to understand clearly the value of this book and Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">7 min: Concluding comments. Song</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another Fine Instrument! (Coni’tZ) </span><span class="font10">ducting Bible studies, possibly in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font10"> book? Should we decide that they might not read it and thus withhold from them the opportunity of obtaining it? No, let us lovingly give as many persons as possible the opportunity to obtain it and read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>c</sup> Do you enjoy doing things for others? Why not, then, have a full share in placing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting </span><span class="font10">during the month of November and enjoy yourself to the full. It is a fine Instrument for us and for others.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What View Do You Take?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How do you feel when a mature brother such as a study conductor visits you? Do you view his visit as simply an effort to get you out into the field service and to turn in a report? Or do you feel he is there because he is genuinely interested in your spiritual welfare and wants to help you? We do want to have the right view, don’t we? In this way we enjoy the greatest benefits from their labors of love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We can learn much from the example of Stephanas and his household. Of them Paul said: “They set themselves to minister to the holy ones . . . they have refreshed my spirit and yours.” (1 Cor. 16: 15, 18) They were interested in helping their brothers. What was to be the response from those to whom they ministered? Paul exhorted : “May you also keep submitting yourselves to persons of that kind and to everyone co-operating and laboring.” (1 Cor. 16:16) So when we visit others we have in mind building them up, and when others come to help us we are thankful that they are concerned about our spiritual welfare, aren’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> It is not, then, a matter of trying to get a field service report when we call on one who is irregular or inactive, is it? We are there to help. That is our chief concern. The congregation is interested in the spiritual growth of all associated, not simply numbers on the</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The “Your Word Is Truth” article in the December 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> is designed for starting home Bible studies with Catholics. In a kind, reasoning style, it considers from the Catholic Bible the question “How Should Christians View Mary?” Do you have some calls on which you might use it to good effect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Literature offer: December, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font8">—in Freedom </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of the Sons of God,</span><span class="font8"> with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.50. January through April, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> subscription campaign. Year’s subscription and three booklets, $1. Please order booklets and increase magazine supply now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Suggested discussions at meetings for service: Week of November 13: Discuss and demonstrate an appropriate simplified sermon. November 20: How to overcome local objections, or effective talking points for new book. November 27: Suggestions on how to drop down to the two-magazine offer if regular offer is not accepted. December 4: Discuss advantages of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> that can be used in presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Any who can arrange to vacation pioneer in December are encouraged to do so. The enrollment requirements are still the same: One must be a regular publisher for six months and baptized, though not for six months. </span><span class="font10">chart. Of course, if the individual wants to share in the ministry but circumstances hinder him, we are glad to assist. If he has little or no desire to do so, then we want to help him become strong spiritually and to stay on the way to life. We feel about him as Jesus described in an illustration at Matthew 18:12-14: “What do you think? If a certain man comes to have a hundred sheep and one of them gets strayed, will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains and set out on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> search for the one that is straying? And if he happens to find it, I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed. Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> So when we visit our brothers who need help, we are not there to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font10"> something but to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font10"> something. As Romans 1:11, 12 puts it, to ‘impart some spiritual gift to them in order for them to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement.’ Our hearts go out to them, as Paul’s did to his brothers in Thessalonica. To them he wrote: “We became gentle in the midst of you, as when a nursing mother cherishes her own children. So, having a tender affection for you, we were well pleased to impart</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">♦ It is suggested that all congregations make arrangements for a special Magazine Day on November 24. which is the worldly Thanksgiving Day.</span></p>

We want to revive their love for Jehovah and their desire to serve him. One of the best ways to do this is to bring them with us to the congregation meetings, in harmony with our text for the year, Nehemiah 10:39, “We should not neglect the house.of our God.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> But what about the list study conductors receive from the assistant congregation servant twice a month, reminding them of any in their group who have not been out in field service? Isn’t he supposed to help them get into the service and remind them to turn. in a report? These lists indicate that here are people who need help of different kinds. A report of field service is not a mark of success in every case. The conductor should analyze the situation and provide the help each individual needs. Some persons may need to have a home Bible study conducted with them again. Others may need to be assisted to get to meetings regularly, so they will really </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font10"> to serve Jehovah. But if what is needed is an invitation to go along in the service, he would not hesitate to offer it. We feel as did Epaphras, a fellow worker with Paul, who put himself to great effort on behalf of the brothers, so that, as stated at Colossians 4:12, they would “finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> So, whether we are giving or receiving assistance, may our view be one of grateful thanks to Jehovah for moving his people to show genuine brotherly love for one another.—1 Thess. 4: 9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">September saw 303,211 publishers in the field. In September 1965 we had 301,135, so there is evidence of growth. Now, do you see yourself in September’s report, or do you somehow feel lost in that big figure? Remember, if Jehovah knows when a sparrow falls, he also knows what each servant of his is doing in honoring him as the months slide by in these final years of the old system. (Matt. 10:2931) Rejoice in having participated in the great shout of praise for our God that these figures represent. Knowing that so many others were united with us in September’s work was one | of that month’s pleasures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Taking In and Giving Out</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our work as servants of Jehovah is really not too complicated, is it? Simply stated, it is a matter of taking in knowledge from Jehovah and then giving it out. This reminds us of what Jesus said, at Matthew 10:8, “You received free, give free.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> But let us not be fooled by the simplicity of the matter. Both taking in and giving out require thought and application. Why? In order that each aspect will be done to the fullest extent possible and also in order that they be kept in proper balance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How could one get out of balance in this vital matter? Well, some have appreciated the importance of serving Jehovah actively in the field and have devoted a considerable amount of time to this. They have had a full field service schedule. However, after a time they began to realize that they were pushing themselves into the service and not getting as much ■ joy from it as they once experienced. Service began to fall off little by little and soon irregularity began to set in, and some even became inactive. Why? Attention may have been focused on giving out, but taking in may have been neglected.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For one to be a zealous, capable publisher, happy in his work, it is necessary for him to be concerned with his own </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">spirituality. </span><span class="font10">This is not at all selfish, but, rather, it is the reasonable and Scriptural approach. (1 Tim. 4:16) So, if you have a good schedule for field service, have also a good schedule for personal study. If you have a home Bible study that you prepare for and conduct faithfully each week, then determine that in the same way you will prepare for and attend the congregation meetings each week. How important it is to be “a fine minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching which you have followed closely”! —1 Tim. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Not only will we be strong spiritually, “nourished with the words of the faith,” but we will be more effective in our ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Regular attendance at the service meeting and ministry school, for example, will keep us right up to date on the latest methods of presenting the truth in the field. Luke 10:1, 2 tells of a meeting Jesus conducted with seventy publishers before sending them out. Would any one of these have wanted to miss the fine Instructions that he then gave? Would they have been truly effective in the field if they had? Of course not!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Nor do we want to be out of balance in the other direction, either, that is, always taking in but doing little in giving out. Our studying would then miss its full purpose, wouldn’t it? It would be similar to living to eat instead of eating to live. How would “this good news of the kingdom” be preached “in all the inhabited earth” if we did not zealously preach? Love of God and love of neighbor will prompt us to have a good share in presenting the good news to others too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> So, why not give the matter serious consideration? Be concerned for your own spirituality. Plan and work things out so that you keep yourself spiritually strong. Personal study and regular meeting attendance play vital roles in this. Then, do your part in presenting the good news to others. Paul had these two important aspects of our ministry in mind when he said: “If you publicly declare that ‘word in your own mouth,’ that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”—Rom. 10: 9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Truly Jehovah has instituted a wonderful arrangement for his people. There need be no end of taking in what is needed in order that our faith may be strong. And there need be no lack of opportunities in giving out, thus satisfying the Christian’s unselfish desire to share the truth with others. How worth while is the effort to maintain a good balance in taking in and giving out!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">• Is it all right to read the paragraphs first when conducting a home Bible study, inasmuch as some students do not do well in studying in advance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conducting a home Bible study we want the student to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. Also, we want to teach him how to study so that eventually he can stand on his own two feet, so to speak, not dependent on us to feed him spiritual food. How can this best be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will it speed progress if we do not encourage the student to prepare in advance, but, rather, when we get there, read the paragraphs first and then the questions? Very likely not. It will undoubtedly encourage lazy study habits. It might even encourage the same for the teacher, and he would no longer be setting a good example, nor would he be prepared to teach as he should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are other advantages to advance preparation. It sets a high standard for the student. It teaches him how to study. The teacher will be able to observe if the student is getting the main points by himself, is relating them to the theme and understands their application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, the teacher can still exercise good judgment and flexibility according to the circumstances. No one should feel bound by rules in the matter. If the student has not studied before you arrive you would likely suggest that the two of you study the material together this time. This will give you the opportunity to review some of the principles for good personal study that he can put into practice in preparing for next week’s study. But what if the student cannot read or just never studies in advance or, if he does, has difficulty in getting the points by himself? In such cases one could read the question first, then read the paragraph, and then read the question again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is always good to encourage the best methods of study, while at the same time not insisting on holding rigidly to a set procedure. Those who have had in mind the higher standard that encourages thorough, advance preparation have seen the best progress in their students.</span></p>

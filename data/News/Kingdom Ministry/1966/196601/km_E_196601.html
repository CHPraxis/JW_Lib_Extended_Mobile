<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY, 1966 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. IX NO. 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><sup><a name="bookmark1"></a>&lt;</sup>-Pub(!isk/is:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Here at Bethel December is always a very busy time because we have the privilege of sending out the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font11"> and calendars that you have ordered through your congregations. It is the time of preparation of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font11"> in Spanish as well as in English. We enjoy the extra activity because we can visualize the happy faces of you brothers who are receiving the latest items produced at the factory. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font11"> is full of much good news and reports on the advance of the Kingdom work in all parts of the earth. By reading the experiences of our brothers in other places we benefit ourselves very much. In our Kingdom service we may at times come into circumstances similar to those related in some of the experiences and then we will have a good lead on how to deal with the situation. Also, while there may be a limit to the amount of field service we are able to do or the number of experiences we may have in the service personally, we can rejoice in the experiences of others and be strengthened in faith and built up for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many theocratic families arrange to consider the daily text together, and this is a fine way of receiving necessary spiritual food. Also, while they are together they make use of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font11"> by considering a report on one country each day. It has been found that letting each one take his turn reading an experience from day to day will bring benefit to the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The calendar illustration, with Jesus speaking out boldly in a synagogue amid unfriendly people, is inspiring to us, and we appreciate the instruction from Nehemiah 10: 39, that “we should not neglect the house of our God.” The calendar is a daily reminder to all of us of our obligations to continue in pure worship and not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Kingdom work is growing and we expect more theocratic increase,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving Jehovah's Purpose</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As we call on people in our ministry, they frequently show real concern about the future, don’t they? They just do not know what lies ahead for them, and many fear the worst. Of course, we know that the religions of Christendom and pagandom have presented a confused view of the future, so it is a real pleasure for us to serve Jehovah’s purpose by having a part in opening the eyes of sincere ones to what the future holds. As you think back, you no doubt realize that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> did much to open your own eyes to the truth ; isn’t that so? So it is a fine instrument to use to aid others to grasp the significance of world conditions and to gain faith in Jehovah’s promises for a righteous new system of things. What a privilege it is to share in this work I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> There is no doubt about it—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> serves Jehovah’s purpose in a wonderful way. People who can be encouraged to read it regularly will grow in appreciation of that purpose. But how can we get it to them? Frankly, from our experience we have found that sharing regularly in the house-to-house work each week is the main way that new subscriptions are so the Society is now planning to construct a new factory building next to the present buildings in Brooklyn. We hope to make it a ten-story building filling up an entire block. New presses have been ordered and these will be delivered in about two years, so we must have a place for them. It is because all are working hard in the field that more literature is required, and so Jehovah has prospered us and given this encouragement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">May our loving heavenly Father bless your efforts during the year. Again we assure you of our Christian love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothei-s,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">obtained. So, if at all possible, make it a point to meet and work along with your service group each week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> There is another suggestion that works well. Have you tried making a check list of potential subscribers? Many brothers tell of success in doing this. They list every possibility and then check off each one as they contact the various persons. For example, they make sure to follow up on magazine placements with the subscription offer, and those who receive magazines regularly on a route are listed as subscription prospects. They also make note of those who deliver milk, read meters or call at the house for some other reason. Then, too, there are classmates at school, persons with whom you conduct a home Bible study or with whom you studied in the past, relatives, neighbors and persons with whom you associate at your secular work. These are all persons that you know, and they are probably more Inclined to listen to you than to another publisher who may call on them for the first time. It is good to take advantage of that situation to help them. This ought to aid us to reach the goal of two subscriptions during the four-month campaign for those of us who are congregation publishers, twenty if we are pioneers, and thirty for special pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> You will be glad to know that, during the campaign, it is planned for each issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">to have an article that ties in nicely with the sermon we will be using —“What Christ’s Return Means to You.” This will make it easy to tie in the offer with the subject on which you have already stimulated interest; and it will make it easy to place individual copies when the subscription is not obtained. And, by the way, don’t forget to read the articles yourself; they contain many fine points of explanation that you will really appreciate.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Serving with Jehovah’s Organization. Song 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Introduction, text and comments. As brother briefly discusses text with audience, publisher questions where additional information on text may be found. Chairman explains how he found information by reading complete chapter in Bible and looking up chain references on the scripture. 10 min: Theocratic News. Audience participation, with additional experiences from 1966 “Yearbook” on countries where items are from. Make items interesting; they do not have to be read verbatim. Consider, too, “1961-1965 Index” and “German Edition of New Book Ready for Use.” 15 min: “Serving Jehovah’s Purpose.” Question-and-answer discussion with audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">17 min: Simplified Sermon Using Psalm 72:7, 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: It is a delight to share good news with others. The Kingdom message is good news. Encourage all to prepare well to use full presentation and simplified sermon when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(12 min.) Mother and daughter prepare for field service together. Mother encouragingly comments that it is always easy and a pleasure to share good news with others. She suggests always viewing field service this way and approaching people with an optimistic outlook. No matter who comes to the door, be warm and friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They then practice simplified sermon, using Psalm 72:7, 8, which tells of blessings when Jesus returns to rule as King. Daughter gives presentation, using mother as householder. Mother commends her. Mother then gives presentation to daughter, who is “busy householder.” (Both should point to article or paragraph in “Watchtower” that ties in well with presentation.) Daughter asks what she would say if she met her schoolteacher or schoolmates. Mother comments that they may well wonder why she has come to their door and suggests daughter might say, “We call to encourage home Bible study. There are many wonderful things we learn from the Bible that we are not taught in school. For example, notice here God’s promise in Psalm 72:7, 8 ...” Daughter expresses appreciation for mother’s loving help and practical suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(3 min.) Chairman encourages parents to set aside time for field service with members of their families during the week. Prepare in advance. New and mature publishers, young and old, can use simplified sermon when appropriate. Make yours an optimistic, encouraging presentation of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts servant’s report and “How Did We Do in November?” Remind brothers to order new “Index.” Song 60.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">18 min: Presenting the Good News —“What Will I Say?” Chairman analyzes points in article with audience. Mature publisher demonstrates helping less-experienced publisher know what to say on return call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Personal Study Builds Strong Faith.” Talk. For source material see “Make Sure” under “Study,” pages 470-473 and October 22, 1964, “Awake!” pages 9-12. Encourage regular Bible reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. Comment on slogan on page 4. Song 79.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: We Ought to Be Teachers in View of the Time. (Heb. 5:12) Song 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Discussion between two brothers. Newer brother asks for help in making back-call where question, “How do you know Jesus did not die on a cross?” has come up. Mature brother shows value of “Make Sure,” using section on “Cross,” pages 139141.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk urging mildness and patience with opposers met in ministry. (2 Tim. 2:24-26) See 1966 “Yearbook,” 123 Hl; 161 fll; 163 fll; 245 fll; 252 U2; 273 Hl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Starting Studies with Those Who Subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: Purpose of our ministry is to make disciples, and literature placements are a means to that end. However, much more is needed. Personal follow-through by starting studies is essential for us to help others to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(7 min.) Publisher concluding sermon obtains a subscription, leaving three booklets. Endeavors to start study in “Good News” booklet. He briefly explains that the booklet may be used to discuss some scriptures on the subject of ‘The True God’ (or other appropriate subject). Invites householder to get his copy of the Bible so he may find proof for points made. In referring to first scripture, at Acts 4:24, publisher helpfully demonstrates how the index in front of Bible can be used to find text. Publisher lets householder locate text in order to get experience. The Bible texts are read, and by employing teaching methods the points in the paragraphs are brought out. Householder is encouraged to express self. Keeping in mind need to keep first call brief, publisher discusses only a paragraph or two and, after a brief review to show value of study, he makes appropriate remarks to lay the groundwork for a return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1 min.) Chairman notes need of starting studies at every opportunity, initially or on return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Publisher makes a return call where subscription was obtained but study was not started on initial call. The groundwork for return call was laid by the concluding remarks when the subscription was obtained. After introductory remarks regarding previous subject, publisher brings out two copies of the “Good News” booklet, hands one to householder and invites him to consider some points from booklet with him. Householder remembers he has copy of booklet and gets his copy. (Same paragraphs as above or different ones may be used for discussion.) After the conclusion of the model study, publisher reviews points learned and arranges for return same time next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman reviews with audience basic points to have in mind on starting studies with those w<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark7">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark8">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark9">4</a></sup>ho subscribe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Let Bible Principles Govern Your Entertainment.” Talk. This should combine material from the Question Box and the article “Do Bible Principles Govern Your Entertainment?” in November 15, 1965, “Watchtower.” Show that we should be balanced in our thinking on entertainment, watching out for our own spiritual condition and that of our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">23 min: “Parents, Care for Your Inheritance.” Question-and-answer coverage. This may also include experiences from parents who have been blessed by children going into the full-time service or who are now serving faithfully and zealously as congregation publishers because of good family training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments. Song 68.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents, Care for Your Inheritance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">All of us like to receive letters. We want to know how our friends and relatives are doing. Parents want to hear from their children. After having spent possibly twenty years in raising a son it is completely understandable that a father and mother, for example, would want to know how this “inheritance” of theirs was getting along. (Ps. 127:3) The following is not an actual letter but is one that could easily be compiled from various letters and reports that have come through the Society’s offices. As a parent, will you, someday, be able to receive one like it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Dear Dad and Mom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Today is just a year since taking up this assignment at the direction of the Society in this congregation that needed so much help and encouragement. It has been such a joyous year and I have so many persons to thank for the encouragement given me; most of all, Jehovah. Recently, though, my thoughts have turned to others to whom I am grateful, namely, you. So many of the good habits that help me now that I am on my own, along with the routine and schedule that I follow, can be traced back to the things that both of you did and insisted that I do while I was growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Don’t worry about my study schedule. It’s a good one. It’s the same one that you insisted our family keep even when we kids couldn’t quite understand the need for being so rigid in it. My partner and I still have Monday evening as our “family” </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver</span><span class="font11"> study period just as we had it at home. When we ask Jehovah’s blessing on this personal </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver</span><span class="font11"> study, it gives me a warm feeling, knowing that this is exactly what you are doing. I have been able to fit in the rest of my personal study very nicely too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Some of the families here are not doing so well and it makes me quite concerned. They just don’t see the importance of disciplining themselves and their children, not only in doing what is good but also in not doing what is unprofitable. How I respect you now for not letting me have my way when I wanted to engage in outside social activities at school and get tied up in “bad associations.” Dad, I can still remember the summer you vacation pioneered during your time off from work. You could never get into the regular pioneer service but you certainly encouraged me to make the full-time service my goal as a career by what you said and did and by the regular service schedule you arranged for me. Some children here aren’t getting that needed guidance during their formative years and their parents don’t seem to appreciate the need to start early. When they ask me how early you started being strict with me I tell them that I don’t remember, that it must have started the day I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘But there is improvement to be seen. Especially is this true in one family that had been quite absorbed in the everyday affairs of life. They had little time for their children, did not have a regular schedule of study and were irregular in service and meeting attendance. Gradually they are beginning to organize, and I really believe that eventually they will be a family working and playing together as ours was. We worked hard but also had time for some fun and relaxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘I just wanted you to know how I was getting along and that I think of you often. I’m glad I had parents who thought of my future when they were supposed to, and I was too young to know what was best. I am happy in my work and I know why. Jehovah is apparently blessing my activity, and I had parents who gave me the best gift possible: Loving training in a Christian household, according to strict Bible principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">‘Warm love to you both, ‘Your son.’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Announcements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">It is suggested that the overseer and the literature servant meet early in January to discuss the literature servant’s work. Such points as balanced ordering so no overstocking occurs, how to use the Literature Check Sheet and keep the progressive inventory, as well as the literature servant’s field work should be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ At meetings for field service during January the following suggestions may be used, if they are appropriate to your needs. January 9, review simplified sermon (Scripture is Psalm 72: 7, 8); January 16, tactfully encouraging householder to invite publishers in during cold weather; January 23, calling back on subscription promises; January 30, what to say on return visits to build on interest; February 6, how to start study in booklet on initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">^Literature offer: January through April, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription cam, year’s subscription and three ets for $1, or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> subscriptions and six booklets for $2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O This year’s Memorial will fall on April 5. It would be well to arrange for your speaker now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O Many will want to vacation pioneer in April. Make plans now. Overseer should order vacation pioneer applications.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• What would be a balanced viewpoint toward social activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When a responsible adult arranges for his own relaxation, it is a personal matter, though, of course, we should always be guided by Scriptural principles. However, when undertaking to invite others to join him, responsibility widens. What are you inviting your brother to do? Where are you inviting him to go? With whom will he associate while there? These are some of the questions you must ask yourself. He cannot put all the responsibility upon you for what he does, if he accepts your invitation, but have you taken reasonable precautions to see that there is nothing about the arrangement that would contribute to his detriment? It is vital that we be upbuilding in all our conversation and conduct.—1 Cor. 14:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Within the family, the dedicated husband or father should make the best arrangements for wholesome recreation, depending upon the needs of each member. At all times parents should know where children still under their headship are, what they are doing and in whose company they are. Obedient children will respect their parents’ wishes and concern in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If several families want to get together for relaxation or recreation, someone must assume responsibility for what is arranged. If a servant in the congregation invites others to his home or otherwise makes some arrangements of this nature, however, it should never be assumed that the congregation is sponsoring what is being done. It is still a private matter. No arrangements should be made in the name of the congregation. The Kingdom Hall and its facilities should not be used for this purpose, nor should announcements regarding any social activities be made or posted at the Kingdom Hall or the service centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time pleasant association in the enjoyment of some good things in moderation is stimulating and refreshing, but let each one assume responsibility for what he does. “Therefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. Keep from becoming causes for stumbling.” —1 Cor. 10:31, 32.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“What Will I Say?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever asked yourself the above question when contemplating a return visit on someone with whom you placed literature? Many of us have. What will we say when we call back on the thousands of persons with whom Bibles and books were placed during December alone, and what about all those with whom magazines and booklets will be placed during the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">campaign? We want to make our return visits purposeful, developing fine home Bible studies, if possible, don’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Really, planning what to say on return visits starts when the initial literature placement is made. For that reason, after the call it is good to jot'down points that interested the householder. This will give you something to talk about, a common ground for a discussion when you return. Of course, don’t wait too long before returning. If weeks go by, the householder’s interest may fade and it will be more difficult to rekindle the interest. When you prepare for your revisit, ask yourself: “Would this presentation interest me if I were the one being called on?” Undoubtedly this will help you to see the necessity of keeping your remarks simple, clear and to the point. Also, using the Bible and directing the householder to it for proof of what you are saying will be most Impressive.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> You read in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> last month that our wonderful new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font11"> was available in Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese, besides English. Now you will be happy to know that the German edition is available. The brothers have really been working hard to get it out. You may send in orders for it immediately. Undoubtedly there are some German-speaking people in your territory you can think of right now who would be delighted to get the book. Be sure to get it for them.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Heartwarming letters continue how we say it is vital, too. Why not discreetly “involve” the householder by finding out if he is satisfied with the answers given. In this manner it will be a two-way conversation and you will be a better teacher by far, as you get the householder’s observations and comments. Of course, some of us may need help in making return visits. If that is true of you, why not make an appointment to have your Bible study servant or your study conductor </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font11"> with you on some of your calls, or to help you prepare what to say in advance. In addition, there are other mature publishers and possibly pioneers in the congregation who can aid you and who are quite willing to do so. Ask them. And what a splendid “friend” we have in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine”!</span><span class="font11"> Here is a ready reference to help you know what to say when you make your return visits.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Some of us may need ideas on how to make our presentation most appealing. If this- is the case, why not read over Study 53 in the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font11"> on “Return Visits.” Here you will find many good suggestions that should prove to be instrumental in giving you greater confidence and effectiveness. Don’t you agree now that advance preparation will make our return visits much more effective and will truly help us in feeding the “sheep,” which is really the objective of our ministry?</span></p>

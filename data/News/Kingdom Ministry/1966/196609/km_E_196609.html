<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We should not neglect the house of our God.”—Neh. 10:39.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QW QMk/is:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">How time flies! Here we are at the beginning of a new service year. Of course, we do not yet know what the world report for the past year will be, but we can all consider the work done in our own congregations during the past twelve months to see what progress has been made. We can check our own increases and decreases. We can analyze the Bible studies that we have been conducting with interested persons, see what progress has been made, and what we can dcr'to stimulate further progress in the months ahead. It is a good time to do a little reflecting on the work accomplished and to plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We should be concerned with the kind of building material we are using to build up our brothers and others interested in the truth of God’s Word. We do not want to be building with wood, hay and stubble, things that are not fire-resistant. Of course, Christ Jesus is the sure foundation on which we build. But, in addition, each one of us ought to build with materials that are fire-resistant, with materials that are like gold, silver and corals, precious materials that fire does not destroy. There is no doubt about it, reports that we get show that the fires of persecution are coming upon Jehovah’s people. We have in mind Portugal, Cuba and East Germany. When we see those brothers withstand great pressures we know that they are built up with fireresistant materials. Now, how about each one of us?—1 Cor. 3: 10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is important to feel the need of gaining a clear understanding of God’s Word. If we feel that need, we will not be neglecting the house of our God, nor will we be slighting our personal study. We will also be busy in the field service. Thus we will be in position to aid others to build with fire-resistant materials because we will be doing the same ourselves. A great aid in this building work is the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">OUR GOAL</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Now that you have learned the truth and have dedicated your life to Jehovah, what is your goal in life? Is it not to stay in Jehovah’s favor, to serve Jehovah everlastingly? Yes, that is the goal all of us have. And we want to find delight always in doing Jehovah’s will. But what is Jehovah’s will for us now? Simply stated, we are called on to do the work that Jehovah’s only-begotten Son did and to conduct our lives by tiie pattern he set.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now, just think for a moment about the pattern he set. Jesus was a preacher and a teacher of God’s Word. He trained others to become fellow preachers and teachers of the good news. And he foretold that during the “time of the end” ‘this good news of the Kingdom would be preached for a witness to all the nations.’—Matt. 24: 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Those words let us know what our work is. We know that if you find Interested people in your territory you will do everything you can to teach them about the King-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Lie.” With it we can aid others to become solid in the faith so that they will be able to withstand the fiery tests that may come on all of us in the not-too-distant future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Starting this month, September, the circuit assemblies will feature a program that can do much to aid us in this building work. On Friday evening the film “Heritage” wiil be featured. On Saturday evening, the color film “God Cannot Lie.” The Sunday public talk will be “Satisfying Mankind’s Greatest Need.” It is an excellent program! Let’s all put forth an earnest effort to be present and to aid newly interested ones to be on hand for all three of these sessions. If we do, we will be greatly aided to do the right kind of building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With warm love for you all, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font12">dom. If others do not choose to listen, do not let this rob you of your joy. We are assigned not to accomplish a world conversion but to give a witness. Just being in the territory and speaking about the Kingdom is accomplishing a witness. By doing this you are doing Jehovah’s will. So do not slow down, do not be discouraged. What you are doing is pleasing to Jehovah!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Noah found no listeners in his territory except the members of his own family. Our territory Is not like that yet, is it? We are still finding interested persons, and studies are being conducted with them, aren’t they? Nevertheless, remember the example set by Noah and his family. They stayed together, they served Jehovah and they survived when God destroyed that world. Isn’t that what we want for ourselves and the members of our family?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Of course, our worship to Jehovah includes more than just sharing in the field ministry. And it is good to analyze our personal activity and our plans for the future. Selfexamination is good from time to time, isn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">• First of all, how are we doing with our Bible reading and other study? Time needs to be set aside for this. (Acts 17:11) Is this something we can do together with other members of our family? Many can. • You parents recall Jehovah’s direction at Deuteronomy 6 :1-7 and Ephesians 6:1-4 that we continually train our children so the truth gets into their hearts and they too delight to do God’s will. Many of you do well in this by conducting a regular family study and by working in the field service with your children each week. However, reports show that improvement needs to be made in this in many homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• About 250,000 of our brothers are regular in attending meetings in the U.S., which is very fine. But </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Serve Jehovah with a Happy Heart. Song 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 min: </span><span class="font10">Accounts report and local field service report for August. Include report on activity of pioneers, if there are any. Commend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Seek&gt; Happiness in Right Association. Encourage all to bring “Make Sure” to . this meeting. Chairman: Encourage all to turn in “Make Sure” to “Associations,” 'page 30. Ask audience what Scriptural counsel they would give a publisher who is (1) Beginning to miss meetings, (2) Going back to some religious association with false worshipers, (3) Considering marriage to an unbeliever, (4) Considering social companionship with worldly people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Our Goal.” Questions and answers. Read scriptures and selected paragraphs as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Field Service Can Build You Up Spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman introduces: Holy spirit aids us in field service. (John 14:26) Service brings joy. (Acts 20:35) It is an evidence of our love for Jehovah, bringing joy to his heart. Regularly sharing in the field service can strengthen you spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Demonstration: Young publisher says to his father: ‘Field service is hard for me. I don’t like it when people tell me they aren’t interested or shut their doors in my face.’ In a kindly way and as an effective teacher father draws out son, discussing points: Why do we go in field service? To please men or God? It honors Jehovah. He can use us as an example to answer those who reproach him. We show we love Jehovah by keeping his cohr-rxrandments. Human observers and spirit observers see that we are on Jehovah’s side. (1 John 5:3; 1 Cor. 4:9; 9:16) We are looking for sheeplike ones. Not all are “sheep.” What joy we have in finding and feeding sheeplike ones! Father assures boy that we are all imperfect and need to train our hearts so we come to love the things Jehovah loves and so we delight to do Jehovah’s will as Jesus did.—Ps. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Boy is benefited by discussion^ strengthened and sincerely thanks father. As he leaves he meets his younger brother, who asks: ‘What were you talking to Daddy about?’ Older brother says: ‘About field service.’ ‘Did you talk about something interesting?’ Older brother says: ‘Yes, I appreciated particularly what Daddy said about our learning to love field service because this is what Jehovah wants us to do.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman concludes, assuring all that we will benefit ourselves spiritually if we come to love the things Jehovah loves. It will also result in life to us and others.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9 min: </span><span class="font10">Concluding comments. Song 111.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING'IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Do Not Give Up in Doing What Is Fine. (Gal. 6:9) Song 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: Two or three members of the congregation committee discuss the material in the September 1, 1966, “Watchtower” article “A Provision for Spiritual Help in Times of Need.” 15 min: Enjoy Your Ministry. Con</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sider “Presenting the Good News in Territory Not Often Worked.” Questions and answers and experiences from publishers who have enjoyed sharing in this work. (“Yearbook” experiences may be used, pages 78, 156-7, 176-7.) Also, “You May Want to Try It.” Chairman can discuss with another publisher ALL the different times during week when individuals can share in field service, including evening work, As time permits, call for experiences from publishers who have enjoyed success in evening work and other experiences that have brought joy to publishers. It would be well to arrange these in advance. 18 min: “It’s Just What We Need.” Question-and-answer consideration of article. Also, demonstration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: Concluding announcements. Include comments on theme for month on page one. Song 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This would be an appropriate time to consider what your congregation has accomplished during the past year and the work ahead of you during the 1967 service year. The branch letter could well be used to start things off. Suggestions from last visit of the circuit servant could be considered and appropriate counsel from the district assembly could be emphasized again. Prepare your own meeting according to local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Use “Awake!” to Spread the Good News. Song 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: Are You Watching the World? This can be handled as an interview or a news broadcast if desired. Report on or read news item; then read and comment on Bible prophecy fulfilled. See “Watching the World” of July 8, 1966, “Awake!” pages 29-31, for news items referred to below. Other news items from current issues can be used if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman: It is strengthening to our faith to observe the fulfillment of prophecy. Have you observed the fulfillment of Bible prophecy in current news?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Children for Sale,” Matthew 24:7, famine. ^“Earth an Explosive Keg,” Matthew' 24:12, increase of lawlessness. “Congo Earthquake,” Matthew 24:7, earthquakes. “The Grab Bag,” 2 Timothy 3:2, lovers of money. Use appropriate items from Theocratic News, Matthew 24:14, this good news is being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: “What’s in It?” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: “Why Does God Permit Wickedness?” Chairman: Discuss with congregation and demonstrate if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As you present the “Awake!” subscription you may use the sermon you like best and present the subscription offer in the way ypu get the best results. For those who would like to use it, a simple presentation is outlined below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: Why Does God Permit Wickedness? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 Tim. 3:1-5 (read parts)—Trouble everywhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rom. 9:14 or Deut. 32:3, 4—Jehovah is not the cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Matt. 6:10 (paraphrase)—Jehovah will change things</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You might say: ‘Our call is to answer a question that has been in the minds of men for years. That is, why does God permit wickedness? The Bible foretold that there would be trouble everywhere in the last days. [Read and comment on parts of 2 Timothy 3:1-5.] A’ou will notice, however, that the Bible makes clear that God is not responsible for 'wickedness. [Read and comment on Romans 9:14 or Deuteronojny 32:3, 4.] Rather, the Bible shows that God will put an end to it. Remember, Jesus taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come and the time when God’s will would be done on earth. Yes, the Bible makes clear that God will put an end to wickedness. That’s good news, isn’t it? But the question still remains: Why does God permit wickedness now? The Bible answer has been clearly set forth in this special issue of “Awake!” ’ A subscription for “Awake!” and three booklets can be offered for $1 or subscriptions for “Awake!” and “The Watchtower” with six booklets, for $2. Offer single copies of the magazines to those who do not accept the subscription offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, what points were made in the presentation? (1) The Scriptures make clear that God is not responsible for wickedness. (2) More than that, he will put an end to wickedness. So, if people take the literature or not, they have been encouraged and built up if they listen to the sermon and understand these two points, haven’t they? But, you say, we didn’t answer the question, Why does God permit wickedness? No, we didn’t. We are going to encourage them to read the answers to that question themselves in the magazine. That way they will be able to get a well-rounded-out presentation and not just part of the answer to the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Increase Earthly Interests of the Prince of Peace. Song 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 18 min: Now That Young Servants of Jehovah Are Back in School. This can be a discussion between parents and children in the same family or parents and children of more than one family, together, in a group. Consider the need for young servants of Jehovah to conduct themselves properly at all times. Consider some of the problems that will face children in the local schools and how Jehovah’s people will conduct themselves properly in speech, dress, manners, obedience, neutrality, holidays, etc. See “The Watchtower” of June 15 and September 1, 1964, for direction on these matters and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on theme “Increasing Earthly Interests of the Prince of Peace.” See “Watchtower” of October 1, 1966, also Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Presenting “Awake!” in Our Territory. Call on mature publishers and pioneers who have been notified in advance to make presentations of the subscription offer or the single magazines, just the way they normally do it most successfully in the Ideal territory. (Sermon need not be included in presentation.) You may want to interview some of these publishers after they make their presentation to ask why they presented things the way they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments. Discuss Question Box. Song 25.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It's Just What We Need</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> One of our goals in the ministry is to start studies with all sincere persons who will study with us. But there are always the questions: How do we start them? and, What should we study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For one thing, we place a lot of magazines in the territory, don’t we? When you get your September 8 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> you will see something new. Read the article under the heading “Your Word Is Truth” and you will find that it has been prepared to help us start Bible studies. This article, entitled “Who Is the True God?” is simple, pointed, and has been prepared for studying with new ones. We hope to have a similar article, but on a different subject, in the first issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When we make a return call and ask the householder if he read the magazines we left with him, the answer is usually “no,” isn’t it? Well, after acknowledging that everyone is busy these days, you could tell the householder that the reason you stopped is that there is something in the issue he obtained (or the issue you are bringing) that you thought he would be interested in. You could ask to step in, if you feel at ease doing this, and then consider the article with him. But how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> First of all, see that all members of the family have a copy of the magazine, if others will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Goal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">about 85,000 are not. Could you help yourself and someone else to be more regular in this? By all means do so, if you can, for the sake of his spiritual health and yours. —Prov. 18 :1, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• Concerning the ministry again, can we improve our share in this? Perhaps we can by increasing the amount of time we set aside for it, or we may be able to start a study or resume a study that was interrupted during the summer. —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• Also, there is a need for time to be set aside to look after things at home and to be together with other members of the family. Periods of recreation are needed. Whenever possible, plan for the family to do wholesome things together.—1 Tim. 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> All of us want to make the progress we can and we should be glad for what we are able to do. If we keep our goal indelibly fixed in mind ■—remaining in Jehovah’s favor, everlastingly serving him—and we work toward that end, Jehovah will surely bless us so that we can always delight in doing his will.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">joining you. Then we would suggest that you just read the first paragraph with the householder. If at this point the householder shows that he is just not interested in this sort of thing, there may be no need to proceed further. If, however, the householder shows interest by following along as you read the first paragraph, why not ask him for his expression or answer to some of the questions in this paragraph? Then go ahead with the reading of the next paragraph.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In paragraph two when it suggests that the householder get his Bible and look up the scripture at 1 Corinthians 8:5, 6, why not invite the householder to get his Bible to do this? Rather than reading the scripture out of the magazine, you may wish to suggest that he read it from his own Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If, after completing a paragraph, you wish to see if the householder</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> If some of you have a certain procedure you follow in starting studies and it works well for you, then by all means use it.

<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Many people have read our magazines for years and yet have not been moved to associate with Jehovah’s people. It is often because they need a home Bible study.

<p><span class="font12">Many brothers are having good success witnessing in their territory in the evening. Perhaps you are too. One brother, after several years of pioneering, said that he is able to talk to more people in the evening than at any other time he shares in the witness work. He is meeting many men in the evening and often they are relaxed, unhurried and willing to talk. Another brother reported that in his territory he is finding as many as four out of five at home and willing to talk during the evening, whereas he is finding only about one out of five at home during the day. You may find in your territory, too, that evening is a good time for house-to-house work, back-calls and Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Our field service report for July shows fine increases over last month’s report in hours, as well as books and magazines placed. So, many people continue to have opportunity to hear and read the truth. Particularly is it pleasing, however, to see that 303,076 publishers shared in the ministry in July. Isn’t it encouraging to you to know that so many of your brothers are sharing with you in Jehovah’s service each month!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> You should have been there to listen to her talk and watch her eyes flash with delight and excitement as she told what happened. Who was it? A sister who had been working in unassigned territory. She told of her thrill in finding a family of publishers, when she thought there were none in the county. She told also of a call at a home where the husband had suffered a stroke and had lost all desire to live. The wife listened and then asked the sister if she would also talk to her husband. He listened, took the magazines, expressed appreciation and began to read. “The wife just cried,” the sister reported. “It was the first time in months he had taken any interest in anything. She just begged ns to come back.” Yes, there are few joys that can be compared to the happiness that comes from finding and feeding hungry sheeplike ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> We always look forward to the special issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> But the question is: What’s in the special issue this time? It’s the answer to the often-asked question: “Why Does God Permit Wickedness?” Sounds like a good subject, doesn’t it? And it is. It is a question in the minds of many people, religious and non-religious. In fact, the reason many people have nothing to do with religion is that they have never been-able to get the answer to that question. So we believe that you will find that this issue will have a great appeal to all kinds of people in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Last year we found that many publishers succeeded in placing 30 magazines and more during the month. With such a good subject to talk about, you may find that you are able to place that many during October too. Some pioneers have been able to place 200 and some specials succeeded in placing 300 and more in a month. We suggest that the magazine-territory servant check with each publisher and pioneer to determine how many magazines he feels he may be able to use.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This summer there are over 1,500 congregations involved in working unassigned territory or helping one another work congregation territory that is not often worked. If you are helping with this work, will you finish up your territory during September? We certainly encourage you to do so, if at all possible. There are sheeplike ones in the territory and we want to find and feed every one of them that we can. Also, we want to endeavor to get mailing addresses of interested ones. During the fall and winter months you may be able to keep the interest alive by making back-calls and conducting studies by mail, if you cannot return to the territory periodically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We will look forward to hearing from you at the end of September on your successes this year in presenting the good news in unassigned territory and in nearby congregation territory not often worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">special issue they will just be getting a taste of the sort of interesting information that will be presented in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> during the year. So let’s be alert to offer the subscription to those who show interest in the special issue. You will be interested to know that during October 1964 we obtained 196,741 new subscriptions, while last October we obtained 173,007—over 23,000 less. This was no doubt because we were offering the new book in the field at the same time. But during October this year we will be offering just subscriptions for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> or a double subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> if you wish. Of course, you will also be presenting three free booklets with each year’s subscription. We know how much we appreciate the excellent information we read in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> from issue to issue. So, with heartfelt enthusiasm tell others why you wouldn’t miss a copy. Offer subscriptions to friends, relatives, neighbors, business associates, teachers, schoolmates and everyone in your territory you can contact. With real pleasure we look forward to the result of our united activity.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question. dSox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">© How much time should a pioneer spend training other publishers in the ministry? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of us have the God-given assignment to preach and teach this good news of the Kingdom. Pioneers are reaching for the goal of 100 hours a month in this ministry, and they are encouraged to try to meet this goal. As stated in “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,” paragraph 65: “The primary responsibility of the pioneer is to devote his time to the preaching work, engaging in house-to-house, back-call, home Bible study and magazine activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, all of us are encouraged to assist our brothers as we are able. (Gal. 6:10) So, if pioneers are able to work with other publishers in the ministry, encouraging and training them, this is very fine. Many pioneers do much in assisting others in this way and other ways and they are to be commended and encouraged to keep up their good work as they are able. Refreshing satisfaction and mutual encouragement often result from aiding others. However, a pioneer may have family responsibilities, employment or other things needing his attention, and his-time for the ministry may be limited. In such a case it may be well for him to use his remaining limited time for his work in the field as a pioneer. He should not feel obligated to wait on other people and look after other publishers at the sacrifice of his pioneer ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So it is up to each pioneer to decide how much time he can spend aiding and training other publishers. Each must take into consideration his own circumstances, show good balance and judgment, remembering the counsel at 2 Corinthians 9:7: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” </span></p>

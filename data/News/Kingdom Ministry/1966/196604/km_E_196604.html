<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)ocvt <sup>&lt;</sup>Pub5iske/is:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">Hello! We certainly had a fine time here in New York when the 41st class of Gilead graduated. We used the new Jehovah’s Witnesses Assembly Hall, which the Society purchased recently. This was packed out and every seat was taken. Over 1900 were in attendance. The program began at ten o’clock in the morning and by the time 4j 30 rolled around in the afternoon we felt as if only an hour had passed. The president and vice-president of the Society spoke, along with the school instructors. We had 102 students come up to the platform to get their diplomas. The 103d student did not make it. He got an appendicitis attack the day before graduation and had to go to the hospital. He is feeling fine now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the afternoon the students demonstrated some of the things that went on in school itself during the last five months, and we actually thought we were in a theater seeing a reproduction of Jeremiah talking to the people of Jerusalem, Job talking to his “comforters,” and Paul writing to the Hebrew Christians. My, what we saw and heard! Really, it was a marvelous day, one filled with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We suppose you are wondering who were able to get into the theater for the graduation. Brother Knorr gave five tickets to each graduate of Gilead so they could give tickets to their friends, mothers and fathers; and there were many relatives there. He also arranged to give a ticket to every pioneer in New York City as well as all the members of the Bethel family. So these, along with a few others who were able to get tickets, just packed out the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But as soon as one grand day ends another starts for us, it seems. Here at Bethel we are now having the pleasure of visiting with many of the circuit and district servants who are going through the revised two-week course of the Kingdom Ministry School that has been arranged for congregation</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Do Not Give Yourselves Up to </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Rest&quot;</span><span class="font9">_______</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was a special occasion when</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Hezekiah made that statement. He had just been made king in Judah and was urging the priests and Levites to get on with the work of cleansing the temple from the defiled condition in which his father had left it. The amount of work to be done was tremendous. They wanted the temple ready for the Passover, now drawing near, so the time was short. Surely, this was no time for resting! Did they make this deadline? Not on Nisan 14, but wise King Hezekiah, acquainted with Jehovah’s loving provision through the Law, had the Passover celebrated on-the fourteenth day of the following month and by that time this great work was done and servants, assistant congregation servants and Bible study servants who will be invited to the Kingdom Ministry School in the coming months. What a pleasure it is to hear their experiences! They even handled the service meeting at the Brooklyn Heights Unit in our Bethel Kingdom Hall. So we have had some fine talent to put on our service meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In a few days we will be listening to the special public talk, on April 3, and following that we will have the Memorial celebration, and we will be working toward a new peak in publishers. There seems to be no end of new things. Oh, yes, we got our pocket edition of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font13"> book on March 7 and the Bethel family broke into enthusiastic applause over it. We like it. We hope you will too. That is all for now. We are getting ready for April and hope to make it a big month here in New York City, and we hope that all of you can do the same. May Jehovah’s blessing go with all of you. With warm love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">the temple was ready.—2 Chron. 29: 11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Were these special efforts rewarded? Yes. It was the most joyous Passover celebrated until that time! Even Israelites from the ten-tribe Kingdom were invited and attended. Unusual, united efforts by God’s servants are surely appropriate on special occasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Do we today have occasions when more than the usual effort is appropriate? Yes, the Memorial is a special occasion for Christians today and the month of April is a time for additional, united effort in God’s service. Appreciating what Jesus’ death and resurrection mean for us, we are stirred to act in behalf of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Are there other reasons for putting forth special efforts during April, even striving to reach the 20-percent goal, if possible? Yes. there are good reasons. This is an excellent time to concentrate on getting new ones into the service. They will be stimulated by the occasion and our special activity. Just showing them how simple and pleasurable the work is could get them started and they might want to have a share each month thereafter. Also, when the servants set forth the figures showing that a goal is reasonable and attainable, we are all encouraged to join in the effort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It is easy to see what the real goal is. We should never think that reaching a certain figure as a goal is the all-important thing. It is the magnifying of Jehovah’s name and the saving of lives that are important. We are interested in people just as Jesus was: “On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.”—Matt. 9:36.</span></p></li>

Certainly you would enjoy receiving good news for a change, isn’t that true? Revelation 21:3, 4 gives this good news. [Read and comment on it.] You may wonder, though, how this can come about in view of the seemingly permanent gloomy conditions on earth. It can only be through the power of God. His promised remedy is clearly stated here at Psalm 37:10, 11. [Read and comment.] To be among the righteous, the Bible shows here at John 17:3 the need for knowledge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ.” [Read and comment.] Present literature, which aids in getting such knowledge. Capable, prepared publisher demonstrates sermon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Those Who Wisely Chose the Right Career. (Experiences with application.) How have others made the vital decision to make the ministry their career? Consider how two made this important decision early in their lives and never regretted the happy outcome. (The life stories of Sister Garcia and Brother Zuercher, contained in w61 508-511 and w65 730-735, should be briefly related. One brother can handle this part as a whole or one can be chairman, with a sister and a brother relating the experiences.) This sister and brother decided with determination to pursue the ministry as a career, despite other opportunities and problems. They reached out for opportunities to serve and thus made advancement in their ministerial careers, the sister to becoming a pioneer, a special pioneer, a Gilead graduate and then a missionary in another country; the brother to becoming a pioneer, to serving at Bethel and then to serving as branch servant. Both are still faithfully pursuing their careers and are happy with Jehovah’s rich blessing. What faithful examples for others! The ministry can truly be one’s happy career, with determination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">10 min: Question Box. A father discusses serving where the need is greater with his family. They consider the material in Question Box together. He may conclude that he will write the Society, supplying suggested information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: “Why Don’t You Try It?” A brother who has been successful in starting home Bible studies discusses this article with a publisher who wants to conduct a Bible study. Read excerpts together. They make appointment to work together in the field to try the suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Branch Letter. Chairman introduces setting. Then mature sister uses this information on home Bible study to show the wide scope of the activities of Jehovah’s organization and . to build appreciation for privilege to come under its loving care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: Concluding comments. Consider “1966 District Assemblies.” Complete April report for publishers and pioneers. Song 66.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An Excellent Way to Aid One Another</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Are you studying with someone you wish would make greater progress? Have you wondered how you are going to aid this student to see the need to share in the ministry? Or have you been asked to aid another publisher in the congregation and you feel at a loss as to how you can be of the greatest aid to him? Well, maybe you have been trying to do too much all by yourself rather than taking full advantage of the arrangements Jehovah has made through the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Think of the encouragement, direction and instruction we get at our meetings. It is truly amazing when you think of the quantity of accurate Biblical knowledge that comes from Christ’s faithful and discreet slave and through the brothers on the platform in just a few months’ time, isn’t it? If new publishers and others being helped were there with us and were getting this spiritual counsel and encouragement into their minds and hearts too, how greatly they would be benefited and strengthened! It would certainly cut down on the work we would have to do personally in trying to get these same thoughts to them by ourselves, wouldn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> An overseer tells of a sister who has aided many to get started in the truth. She has some difficulty teaching on home Bible studies because English is not her native tongue. But what does she do? She gets them to the meetings as quickly as she can. The congregation servant says that when they first begin to attend they don’t really have a good grasp of the truth, nor do they know very much about the organization. But the friendly and urgent invitations of the sister have suc</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN FEBRUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">February is a short month, a cold, month, and this year it saw a great deal of sickness. Yet, how did we do? A number of , definite improvements were made over January, but it was in the Bible study work that we excelled. A total of 240,339 were conducted, 4,860 more in February than in January, and January had been our best month in studies since our peak of last April. With this fine start, what will March and April bring in new Bible studies? </span><span class="font13">ceeded in getting them there. They immediately begin to enjoy the association and they learn from the meetings. The overseer says: “When she gets them to the meetings, Jehovah’s congregational arrangements begin to take over and they progress excellently.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> But what about encouraging new ones to attend service meetings during April when we are considering how they can be helped into the service? Won’t this be premature or even a shock to them? Not necessarily. Don’t most people already know that each one of Jehovah’s witnesses is a minister and engages in the ministry in one way or another? Surely. After they have listened to a program such as this, your work in assisting them may be a great deal easier. You may simply have to refer back to that meeting, build on the information presented and help them to see how they can share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> In fact, if every one of us endeavored to be in attendance at each meeting during April, wouldn’t this greatly aid us all to be successful in our efforts for the month? Without a doubt! Whether the absent one is mature or new, how could we ever personally repeat to him all the fine information presented at the meeting that he missed? Much would surely be overlooked. Also, there we enjoy the warmth of association. And Jehovah’s spirit is present at each meeting. So, why not say, in the words of Isaiah 2:3: “Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths” I What an excellent way to aid one another!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Don’t You Try It?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Are you now conducting a home Bible study? If not, would you like to? Or perhaps you would like to start another one. How can you do so? The following letter received a short time ago has the answer:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> “It is with pleasure that I write to you in appreciation for our circuit servant’s visit December 28 to January 2. The circuit servant was a great encouragement to my wife and me and our small isolated group. At our pioneer meeting he inquired of us concerning offering the householder a free study on the door-to-door call. We had not really done so. He encouraged us to try that following morning and he scheduled one hour to see how it would go. We also did this on Thursday and Sunday mornings. I am overjoyed to say that on my first two calls I started two studies, placing a Bible and an </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font13"> book with one householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> “The second study I arranged for was with a lady whom I had called on at least five times. Twice my wife haff tried to -place literature and start a study, to no avail. I used the suggestion in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> and showed her the importance of Bible study in the home, using John 17:17 and Deuteronomy 32: 46, 47. She was receptive but, as my wife had told me, used her husband as a reason for holding back. I asked to see him and she said that I could do so the following Tuesday. Tuesday came and my wife and I called. When my wife recognized the house, she whispered, ‘He’s opposed!’ Well, the ‘opposed’ man met us at the door, inviting us in out of the rain. He had us sit down and then asked, ‘I hear you are encouraging Bible study, is that true?’ I answered in the affirmative, stating that we offered our aid one hour each week at the person’s convenience, using whatever Bibles they possessed. He replied, ‘This family needs such a study, since my wife is Baptist and I am Catholic. A divided house cannot stand.’ He asked if his four children could sit in, and we urged them to do so, saying that special preparation would be made for them. He set the date and time, saying, ‘I’ve often wanted to do this, just let that Bible answer questions, but I never knew anyone went around encouraging Bible study.’ Now the whole family is looking forward to their first study, and we realize the importance of following through on the Society’s suggestions fully. We were also able to start five more studies.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do Not Give ... Up to Rest&quot; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">((; ant’d) </span><span class="font13">too, have much more than a numerical goal in mind when encouraging and helping others. They have in mind the spiritual welfare of those entrusted to their care, just as Epaphras had, concerning whom Paul said: “Epaphras, who is from among you, a slave of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings, always exerting himself in your behalf in his prayers, that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God. I indeed bear him witness that he puts himself to great effort in behalf of you.”—Gol. 4: 12, 13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> But, should we confidently expect numerical increase? The first-century Christians expected it and kept track of their increases. First, about three thousand souls were</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font13">added, then the number became about five thousand, and thereafter the congregation kept on increasing from day to day. (Acts 2: 41; 4:4; 6:7; 16: 5) For our day God has promised a great crowd that no man can number.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> What a blessing it is for a congregation of God’s people to be drawn together in a lifesaving work into which they can put their whole mind, heart, soul and strength, knowing that their brothers and interested persons will benefit greatly, and that Jehovah’s blessing will be upon such unselfish activity! While it is not necessary to injure health or neglect family or other responsibilities in order to share fully in April’s activity, yet it is good to keep in mind the spirit of Hezekiah’s statement, “Do not give yourselves up to rest.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Almost three of every five publishers do not yet conduct a Bible study. Surely many more of us can do so. As you present the good news, why don’t you try this method for starting studies?</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">• Before writing- to the Society about serving where the need is greater, what should we consider? What should our letter contain?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Those who volunteer to serve where the need is greater are usually invited to aid a small congregation that needs help in covering territory, servant assistance and aid in conducting meetings. The ones whose aid can do the most good are mature publishers who get along well with others and are able to take the lead in the ministry and train others. You may wish to discuss your plans with your overseer. He will be glad to encourage and assist you, as will the circuit servant during his visit. If you are relatively young, it is good to seek your parents’ counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You should tell us the name of your congregation and unit, your age, date of baptism, position in the congregation, and, if married, give like information for your wife and children. Mention the states in which you prefer to serve. Let us know if you need full or part-time secular employment or are retired with an adequate means of support. While you will make your own arrangements for employment and housing, such information is often helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rich rewards and blessings await those who can serve where the need is greater. Can you do so? If so, the Society will be happy to hear from you so you might, in effect, ‘step over into Macedonia and help us.’—Acts 16:9.</span></p>

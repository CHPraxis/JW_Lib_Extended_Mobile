<p><span class="font14">The European series of “Word of Truth” assemblies attended by Brother Knorr and Brother Franz and 992 other brothers and sisters from this side of the Atlantic, along with some from Africa and the Middle East, came to a successful conclusion with the assembly in Berlin July 21-25. Though the weather was cool during most of these assemblies, a warm feeling was built up among all the brothers, and great appreciation was expressed for the assembly program and for the Christian unity experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Brothers from some lands where there is not freedom of assembly for Jehovah’s people enjoyed going to other countries to attend. A special train was arranged by the brothers in Greece so they could share in an all-Greek assembly of their own in connection with the Vienna assembly, and over 1,200 were present for those Greek meetings. As you can imagine, the enthusiasm ran high; and this was also evident at the Spanish and Portuguese meetings at Basel. In all, more than 2,000 came from the Iberian Peninsula. More would have been present if the police had not refused to grant them passports. However, those who did attend were able to take back glowing reports. In addition, many of the travelers from the United States and Canada visited Spain and Portugal and so were able to strengthen the brothers there spiritually. Many said that their visit to these lands was the highlight of their trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Among the benefits to the European brothers from their assemblies was the release of publications in their own languages, such as “Let </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font14"> in Danish, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth” </span><span class="font14">in French, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font14"> book in German, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font14"> in Finnish, and others too. Thus they have further equipment to use in boldly speaking God’s Word with his spirit. Reports from the assemblies are as follows:</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Pause for a few moments and meditate on your activity in behalf of pure worship this past service year. What are your thoughts? Did you add to your knowledge and appreciation of God’s Word of truth during the year? Did you reach some of the service goals you had in mind? Did you progress toward Christian maturity? Did you help someone else to do the same? If you did some of these things, then you must have a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. We rejoice with you in this.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> But there may be a number of things you did not get done. Possibly you wanted to be a vacation pioneer or a regular one, but circumstances did not allow it. It could be that sickness or something else beyond your control prevented you from accomplishing as much as you wanted to. Does this make you feel somewhat discouraged? If so, let it be only temporary.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">Your brothers, rejoicing with you in the privilege of assembling together in these “last days.”</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Go On&quot;</span></h1>
<p><span class="font14">in the race for life? Have we made some progress? If so, then let us draw encouragement from the words of the apostle Paul at Philippians 3:16: “At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Yes, “let us go on.” How? Well, why not begin this month, September, and get the new service year started off right? And how might this be done? Maybe you can renew a Bible study that was discontinued during the summer. Do the service and study schedules of the children or other members of the family need to be revised now that school is starting? If recently you haven’t had as much opportunity to get into the door-to-door work as you would like, why not set aside a regular time each week to join with your brothers and sisters in this activity? During September we will all be offering the latest book. Perhaps your participation in this activity will result in your starting a brand-new home Bible study! Think of how much you could teach an interested person in the next year if you conducted the study regularly each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In the past year a good deal of personal assistance has been rendered, and what a fine thing this has been! Then again, could it be that individually some of us could take more initiative in helping ourselves? Can we shoulder more of our own responsibility and do more in Jehovah’s service without waiting for someone to take us by the hand? Our doing so will be an evidence of growth toward spiritual maturity, and what an inner joy that will bring us! Just as a baby eventually grows strong and begins to walk by himself, so all of us want to reach spiritual manhood and even come to the point where we can help others.—1 Cor. 13:11; 16:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Rejoicing in Our Progress. Song 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Branch letter. Volunteers from audience can express briefly what they feel is outstanding in each paragraph. Comment on the benefits your congregation derived from the assembly this summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: Our Progress in Faith and Service. Talk and discussion on progress of congregation during past year. Use Acts 16:4, 5 as introduction and weave it into discussion as appropriate. This should deal with congregation’s spirituality and accomplishments in field ministry. The speaker should compare congregation's accomplishments with its own past activity and present potential for expansion, giving commendation and wholesome suggestions for further growth in activity and numbers as well as spirituality. It would be good also to consider the congregation's activity in the light of the suggested service goals. Such points as how many new publishers were started in the field, the number who were baptized, improvement in field service averages, regularity in field service, meeting attendance, new pioneers, number of vacation pioneers, etc., may be considered. Other highlights that apply to the congregation, such as dedication of a new hall, formation of new service centers or a new congregation, can also be mentioned. Possibly there could be a discussion among several study conductors or mature publishers bringing out some of the above points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Emphasize the growth in spirituality in the congregation and what has been accomplished by serving together during the past year. Be upbuilding, encouraging and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There will be no need to compile the totals and averages of each publisher on his record card nor should the cards be given out, though individual publishers are always welcome to see their card. Each one should be made to feel a part of the accomplishment of the entire congregation. The assistant congregation servant can provide some helpful statistics to the overseer regarding the congregation’s ministry and growth. How the new commandment of love can influence the congregation’s activity for the coming year might be considered. Undoubtedly the overseer will want to handle this. 15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Let Us Go On.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments, including July Service Report and local August report. Encourage all to order additional copies of special October 8 and October 15 issues of “Awake!” and “Watchtower” for use next month. Suggested goals: 30 for publishers, 200 for pioneers for the month. Song 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Successfully Witnessing to Relatives and Others. Song 87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “Have You Tried This?” Audience participation. Include local experiences if time allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">30 min: “Have You Told Your Relatives?” Discussion and demonstration based on article in August 1, 1965, “Watchtower.” Encourage all, in advance, to bring this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(18 min.) Enthusiastic discussion of entire article by audience participation, or by three publishers. Emphasize main points set out in boldface subheadings in article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chairman should lead in keeping discussion lively. When discussion of article is completed, demonstrate what is especially appropriate to your congregation, or the following points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(5 min.) Demonstration of points under “Consider What Interests Them.” Chairman introduces setting. Husband and wife will be visiting relatives soon. Want to be sure to give witness but wonder how to prepare and what to talk about. They talk about what might interest relatives, recalling what they know about them. They remember some of relatives’ interests and then try to recall “Watchtower” or “Awake!” articles that had good material on those subjects. Are happy with results of their preparation and research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(5 min.) Demonstrate: “Aid Them to a Favorable Frame of Mind.” Chairman sets scene with relatives. Conversation is general, then turns to what relatives are interested in, probably some aspect of world affairs. Witnesses enter into discussion, then begin to turn conversation to concern for solution and what Bible says. They follow closely the fine suggestions given regarding tact, not saying too much, showing a loving attitude, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font12"> min.) Brief summary of major points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Comment on slogan at bottom of page 4. Song 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(This can be prepared by overseer. Consider carefully the needs of the congregation and arrange for interesting, beneficial program.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FIFTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(Those having Friday meeting will have this program October 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Advance Preparation Aids Us to Speak Boldly. Song 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: “Wake Them Up to the Urgency of Our Times.” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Mature brother will discuss with audience the material in Question Box. Show how this information is a logical extension of that presented in last month’s Question Box. Highlight the principles involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: New sermon for “Awake!” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme; Meaning of World Conditions 2 Tim. 3:1—Critical times foretold for “last days”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 Tim. 3:2-5 (Read parts)—We are living in “last days”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 Pet. 3:13—Hope lies in God’s righteous new system of things</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A suggested way to give this sermon is this (after initial greeting): ‘I have called to see you for just a few minutes. I have something to share with you that can make your day more cheerful. There are many conditions in the world that are a source of great concern to sincere persons. Problems in the home, in making a living and in protecting ourselves against crime are constantly increasing. What does it all mean? The Bible, which you no doubt have in your own home, gives the answer. Notice what it says about these “critical times” here in 2 Timothy 3:1: . . . [Read]. So the Bible emphasizes that such “critical times hard to deal with” would prevail in the “last days.” That does not mean the “last days” of this earth, because it will endure and there will always be people living on it. But it means the “last days” of the present wicked system of things. In the next few verses it mentions specifically some of the conditions that would exist at this time. [Point out a few in verses 2-5.] These are conditions that we see all around us today, aren't they? [Allow householder to comment.] Keep in mind that the very increase in these bad conditions shows that they are soon to be brought to an end by God. But what lies ahead for you and me if we are persons who love righteousness? Second Peter 3:13 answers in this way: . . . [Read]. Since God has promised this, we can have confidence that it will be done, and that is a good reason to be cheerful. But does the Bible also give advice on how to cope with these critical conditions while they are still here? Yes, it does, and some of these things are dealt with in the “Awake!” magazine.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(It is suggested that the sermon be discussed with the congregation and then demonstrated, using the suggestions given above.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Cover applicable points under Announcements. Song 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(For those having Friday meetings this will be the second meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Help Men Get Saved from This Crooked Generation. (Acts 2:40) Song 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on October’s theme “Help Men Get Saved from This Crooked Generation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Good Reports.” Discuss with audience. Include Theocratic News items; these also are good reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Presenting the “Awake!” subscription convincingly. (Brief talk, interview, demonstration and summation) Being convinced of the value of “Awake!” we want to have effective share in helping others to appreciate it. The clarity with which we describe the “Awake!” and its purpose will, to a great extent, determine the success of our effort. Advance preparation is needed in order to be convincing. It is often good to use a specific point from an article that ties in with our sermon, possibly reading this to the householder. We can also make effective use of the material on the inside of the cover on “The Reason </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font12"> This Magazine,” giving an overall view of “Awake!” The number of languages in which “Awake!” is published as well as its circulation could be mentioned. So we can refer to a specific point in an article, give some informative comments about the overall features and benefits of “Awake!”, or a combination of these. Usually it is best not to cover too many points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After a brief talk on the above, the speaker can interview two publishers who have prepared in advance, asking them what points they found effective in presenting “Awake!” Then each one can be asked to demonstrate a presentation, using this special issue of “Awake!” Audience can then be invited to comment on value of points demonstrated. Chairman can summarize, encouraging all to present “Awake!” convincingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 83.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The other day we were talking to the brothers in the Writing Department and they let us have a glimpse of what has been prepared for the special October S issue of Iwafce/ We were delighted, and we are sure that you will be too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> They explained to us that this issue has been prepared in such a way as to have a strong appeal to persons with a minimum of interest in religious matters. There are a lot of those people in our territory, aren't there? They may be concerned about the problems of life that seem to affect them most directly, but they fail to consider what the Bible says about the urgency of the times. So this issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> considers the very topics that people are interested in talking about. It discusses them from a standpoint that they will appreciate, and then proceeds to show what fine advice the Bible gives on how to cope witli these problems now. Having sharpened their appreciation for what the Scriptures say, the magazine emphasizes that the Bible also makes clear that the very conditions that are of personal concern to them are strong evidence that we are living in the “last days.’’ In this way it tactfully but forcefully awakens the reader to the urgency of our times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The attractively designed cover of the magazine, we observed, features the theme “WORLD CONDITIONS EXPLAINED—by the Bible</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The October 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will have the article “Personal Help to Answer Your Bible Questions.” It is designed to acquaint our readers with the free home Bible study service offered by Jehovah’s witnesses and to stimulate a desire on their part to take advantage of it. If publishers leave this article with prospective students and suggest that they read it, on the next call it may be quite easy to get right into a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Study conductors may find it beneficial to discuss the following subjects during Sunday meetings for field service: September 5, review sermon. September 12. talking points for use in placing books. September 19. consider all possibilities for placing books. September 26, making back-calls on persons who have obtained books. October 3, review new sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Literature offer: October, subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> and three booklets, for $1. November, latest bound book and booklet. December. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> and latest book with booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ New publications available:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Let Your </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Name Be Sanctified&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">—English </span><span class="font14">in Your Home.” Then as we thumbed through the articles we found that the first one, entitled “Your Life Is Affected,” presents a synopsis of the articles to follow and helps the reader to see that they are topics that vitally concern him. Following this are discussions of the subjects “How Much Is Your Money Worth?” “Facing the Crisis in Family Life,” “Why the Rising Tensions World Wide?” “How to Protect Yourself from Crime and Violence,” “Why the Growing Loss of Faith?” and “How We Know the Bible Is God's Word.” These subjects touch the lives of everyone, don't they?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Individual copies of the magazine should be easy to place, and, appreciating the good that this issue can do, we will all want to use it freely. During past campaigns with the special issues you have done excellent work, and we are confident that the same will be true this time. As in the past, we suggest that publishers endeavor to place 30 magazines during the month, pioneers 200, and special pioneers 300. May these magazines, coupled with your earnest presen-</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> We are always happy to hear of good success in the field. One publisher writes: ‘How good it is to have time to follow up all my placements I Prior to the January 1965 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> article entitled “Do You Make All Your Back-Calls?” I usually set aside Sunday morning for house-to-house work. I kept contacting interested persons, but I was never able to make all my back-calls. Frankly, my conscience disturbed me. Now, though, since I am spending at least half of my time in back-call work, even using some time on Sunday morning for return visits when this is necessary, not only am I making all my back-calls, but I am becoming more effective in the ministry.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Another publisher tells us: ‘I appreciated so much the suggestion you made that we were to arrange the best time to call again on interested persons, even though it meant using part of Sunday morning. A few weeks ago my first call Sunday morning turned out io be on one manifesting fine interest. When I asked about a convenient time for the return call, the householder said: “Come this time next Sunday.” I did and a fine study was started.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We are happy to know that many of you are enjoying good success in calling back on the interested ones you have found.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Of course, October is also the month we have set aside to obtain </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> subscriptions, and we feel that the broad selection of topics in the special issue gives a good representation of the type of information that can be expected in future issues. Offer the subscription, along with three booklets, for $1. Or, if you prefer, present subscriptions for both </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> for $2. The October 15 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> you will be glad to know, features the fine public talk given at the assemblies this past summer, “World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace.” We have personally benefited from this information. Now it is our privilege to share it with others, using it to wake them up to the urgency of our times. What a blessing it will be to those who receive it!</span></p><img src="km_E_196509_files/km_E_196509-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:173pt;height:40pt;"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">• Mav persons who do not qualify to Share' in the field ministry and report as publishers be enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The purpose of the Theocratic Ministry School is to aid those who are associated with the congregations to learn to express the truths contained in God’s Word. Brothers learn to give talks to the congregation; both brothers and sisters become adept in handling situations that are encountered in the field ministry and in everyday conversation with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Baptism is not a prerequisite to enrollment, nor is participation in the field service. So even those newly associated with the congregation are welcome to enroll; this is part of our program of instruction. It is true that some who want to enroll may still be members of organizations the operation of which is not in harmony with the Scriptures, or their lives' may not be morally clean. Nevertheless, if they are sincerely interested in learning God’s Word and equipping themselves so that in time they will be able to share in Jehovah’s service, they may enroll in the school. In this way they can be helped to learn what Jehovah requires of those who serve him. (Rom. 12:1, 2) However, when they give talks, out of respect for the congregation they should wear street clothes, not a uniform that identifies them as part of some un-scriptural organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, a person who was once part of Jehovah’s organization but is now disfellowshiped or who has disassociated himself by deliberately pursuing a course in violation of Christian neutrality should not be enrolled in the school, since he may not even comment in the meetings.—Rom. 16:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In assigning talks to those who are enrolled in the school, it should be kept in mind that only brothers who are mature, setting a good example for the congregation, should be assigned to give the instruction talk, and only brothers who are experienced speakers should be asked to give the final student talk, which deals extensively with the meaning of the Scriptures. But the other student talks may be handled by anyone who is enrolled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Have You Tried This?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Wouldn’t you rejoice to receive a message like this: “Thank you so much for your fine letter. It came at a time when I had just about given up ever getting </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> When I realize how hard you tried to see that my subscription was delivered, I am truly amazed. Now I am determined to read the magazine with greater interest and respect, to say the least. Thank you very much for your concern. Here is my new address”? Yes, any of us would enjoy receiving a letter like this one, and it was all possible through witnessing by letter writing. While we recognize that this should not take the place of regular witnessing from house to house for those who are able to do so, yet there are some who are physically unable to walk from house to house, and we highly recommend this course to them. Additionally, there are those who are confined to home temporarily because of illness, the weather or other reasons who have engaged in letter writing with good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Consider the many opportunities that are open to each one of us for witnessing through writing letters. Letters can be written to relatives, families of deceased ones, parents of newborn children, those newly married, persistent not-at-homes, persons on our back-call lists, those whose subscriptions have expired, individuals living in apartments difficult to work, etc. Why, even Bible studies have been successfully conducted by mail.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> But sometimes those who write letters get discouraged because there is little or no response to their mail. Do not despair. Isn’t it true that the same thing happens in the house-to-house work, and yet these brothers don’t give up, do they? No, they will call again soon so that the householder will have another opportunity. And remember, it is difficult for many to answer letters. Your letters may do a great deal of good and you might not even hear about the results for a long time. The very fact that you are giving a witness is the important thing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> What should we write? is often asked. Why not say much the same thing that you would in giving a sermon from house to house? This would be most effective. Additionally, there are some fine suggestions on letter writing in Studies 29, 30, 3G and 47 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font14"> One of the main things is to be warm and encouraging. Let them know that you would much rather speak to them personally, but because this has been difficult or impossible you are writing. Also, be neat, brief and to the point. When getting started, if you want someone to check your composition, your overseer or one of the other capable publishers will be happy to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> You might include a tract or a magazine, perhaps especially selected to back up the points made in your letter. The cost for including one magazine in a sealed envelope, first class, is ten cents. Some prefer to send their letters ahead of the magazines, sending the letter by first-class mail and the magazine second class. The cost to send one magazine second class is four cents. Place the magazine in an unsealed envelope, or wrap it neatly and send it marked “second-class mail.” Remember, if you send your magazine by second-class mail, do not include any writing. Put on envelope your name and return address.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Letter writing has an appropriate place in our witnessing. Undoubtedly more of us could use it to good effect as we present the good news. Why not try it?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">July was the month when most of the assemblies for the U.S.A, were held. Attending, traveling to and from them, volunteering for service before and after assemblies took time that we would otherwise devote to field service. Vacations took time too. Yet we did commendably! Over 15,000 more publishers reported than last year in July, and most of the service averages were up too. Fine, indeed! An increase in the praise given to our God makes us all rejoice.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">During the week of the circuit servant’s visit the Moscow, Idaho, congregation averaged 8.8 hours, 9.3 magazines, 1.1 back-calls and 9 new studies started, with 30 out of 36 publishers out in the field. ♦ Publishers in Cuba averaged 12.5 hours, 7.1 back-calls and 1.3 studies, in June. Over 4,000 applied for vacation pioneer service in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Circuit assembly in Tahiti attended by 151 at public meeting, 271 at film showing. All 94 publishers happy to receive first booklet in Tahitian. Fifteen were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">$ Reports received from Iraq and Saudi Arabia for first time this service year. Prospects good for continued activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V Clergy oppose work and burn literature in Fernando Po. New peak of 105 publishers reached there in June. ▼ Portuguese colony of Macao expels two special pioneer sisters for preaching. $ Four special pioneers on Sakishima Gunto, near Okinawa, see first fruitage after two years of work as three symbolize dedication. Five others also publishing there now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V Hawaii reports five new congregations and one new circuit formed since April. Now 42 congregations in the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">▼ Kenya’s 53-percent increase is eighth peak this service year. Now 234 publishers reporting.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Isn’t it evident, then, as we look back on the past service year, that each one of us has reason to rejoice in some accomplishment and progress? How can this be true in even fuller measure during the new service year? One of the brothers at Bethel put it this way: “Being a better Christian and helping someone else to be, is going to be one of my chief goals. Of course, I will try to reach my service goals. I have always seen great value in them. But we have far deeper and more meaningful goals, such as concern for our own lives, the lives of our brothers, and the lives of interested persons in the field.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> How about you? Jehovah makes provision so that we can be happy in his service. So find real contentment this service year in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

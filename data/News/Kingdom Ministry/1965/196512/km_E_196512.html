</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">The big thing causing excitement here recently was the Yankee Stadium meeting with Stanley Jones, which is reported on elsewhere in this </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font16"> It was a grand meeting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">All of you know about the survey being made for the Central and South American convention tours planned for next winter. The way things look now. about 225 are going to Central America by airplane and another 225 are taking the South American trip. About 75 will be taking the entire trip through Central and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Mexico is going to get a big crowd. Approximately 340 plan to go by air and, with those going by car and other means, the survey shows that it will go up to about 2,750. Letters are still coming in, so the figures are not yet complete. If you are going to make one of these trips and have not signed up, please write us immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Brother Knorr is going down through Central and South America beginning December 7 and will be gone for about seven weeks. He will be checking into all the convention arrangements being made to care for both local brothers and those who will be traveling from other lands. There are many details that have to be cared for in regard to hotel accommodations, airplane travel and organization at the branch offices, so Brother Knorr will have a busy trip. We will all be glad to see him return and then to hear more about his trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We hope that all of you have a grand time in December distributing the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font16"> and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark0">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark1">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark2">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark3">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark4">5</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote6"></a><a href="#bookmark5">6</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#bookmark6">7</a></sup></span><span class="font16">&nbsp;book. This combination certainly fits in well with our theme for December: Fearless in Preaching God’s Disclosed Secrets. We are all busy here in Brooklyn getting publications out to you on time, and it is a pleasure to keep you supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">May Jehovah's blessing be upon all of you. Be assured of our love.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> It has been stimulating to us to read letters from many of you expressing appreciation for the new book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font16"> One of the circuit servants said: “We were elated with the ease with which the new book is accepted, and it seems to be just what the people are looking for.” Appreciating the book ourselves, we will all count it a joyous privilege to continue to offer it throughout December, won’t we? Present it, along with the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </span><span class="font16">for $1.50. What a powerful combination this is! Surely each one of us, as we respond to Jehovah’s spirit, will be moved to share wholeheartedly in the distribution of this excellent offer, thus aiding many to know that ‘God cannot lie.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> As you know, December is also the month when we hope to reach a 10-percent increase. The question is, What can we do to reach that goal? Really, it is not all done in December. It is the culmination of many months of work. But there is much that we can do in December.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Ask yourself: “Who is there that would like to have a share in praising Jehovah and that we could help this month?” Well, those who have been studying with us and who have made fine progress begin to have that desire, don’t they? Are you studying with such a person? If so, why not suggest that he read the material under the heading “Preaching the Good News” in the new </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure?’</span><span class="font16"> book, and, after laying that foundation, invite him to go along with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Others, who have already had a share in the service, may also need some encouragement. Stop for a moment and think who there is that you personally can help. If you are a parent, you no doubt think of your own children, don’t you? Then, too, there are others, some of whom</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Theme: Fearlessly Declaring the Good News. Song 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 13 min: Branch Letter and “1966 Assembly Dates.” Two mature brothers discuss material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Making the Bible-and-Book Offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(2 min.) Chairman: After giving sermon, to be effective in placing offer, draw attention to informative, appealing points in the literature. Audience invited to listen to discussion between literature servant (or other servant) and publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(10 min.) Publisher getting literature from literature servant would appreciate suggestions for making offer. Enjoys using sermon found in October “Kingdom Ministry,” appreciates importance of good tie-in of literature on completion of sermon, but feels his should be improved. Servant makes clear that, while both book and Bible are being offered as a combination, either one can be featured, depending on one’s desire and what seems best for householder. In response to publisher’s question, “What could I show the householder if I highlight the book?” servant makes various suggestions such as: Chapter 3 of the book, which summarizes the Bible from Genesis through Revelation, highlighting the means by which God will fulfill his purpose; various points in Chapter 20; the fine illustration on the title page can be used with Revelation 21:3, 4 paraphrased, etc. Regardless of what talking point on the book is used, briefly introduce the Bible with an appropriate comment such as, “This is the complete Bible, Genesis through Revelation in modern English,” and then make the offer for $1.50. Servant demonstrates one of the above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If the Bible is featured and one does not have a copy of “Renderings of Scriptures Compared” (which is no longer available from the Society), scripture comparisons on page 52 of the new “Make Sure” may be used to good advantage. After featuring the Bible, introduce book as a Biblestudy aid that covers many vital, basic Bible doctrines, or briefly use one of talking points outlined above, and then make the offer. Servant demonstrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(3 min.) Chairman: All encouraged to prepare selves to feature book or Bible, whichever they can offer more effectively. If householder has one of publications offered, offer the one he does not have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: “Let Jehovah’s Spirit Move You to Declare ‘God Cannot Lie’!” Question-and-answer coverage. Read appropriate paragraphs. Comment on number of books placed in October. (See column 3 on this page.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">2 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments. Include local November report and number of books and Bibles placed so far in December. Encourage all to be out by December 12. Song 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Theme: Boldly Yet Tactfully Declaring the Good News. Song 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Introduction, text, comments. 15 min: Questions and answers on “Report from China” and “ ‘Impossible to Lie' Book in Three More Languages.” Encourage publishers to order these after the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Talk on “Faith, Hope, Love— Not Apathy.” (See “The Watchtower,” November 1, 1965.) Encourage congregation to reach 10-percent goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Presenting the Good News. Audience participation and demonstration of points. Highlight importance of showing consideration for others and developing discernment in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments. Include some local experiences in placing new book and/or Bible. Encourage publishers to try to place at least one book and one Bible during December. Song 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This should be designed to fit the needs of your congregation. Overseer should arrange for an instructive and encouraging program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FIFTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Theme: Loyally Serving the True God. Song 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Cover items from Theocratic News. Discussion between publisher and one with whom study is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Discuss Question Box. Apply to needs locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Lively session of experiences resulting from presenting the offer. Arrange well in advance so this will be informative and upbuilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">20 min: Discussion and demonstration of new sermon for “Watchtower” campaign. Have sermon outlined on blackboard, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theme: What Christ’s Return Means to You</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Matt. 25:31, 32—Returns in glory for judgment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">John 14:19—Invisible to human eyes Ps. 72:7, 8—Obedient will enjoy bless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ings</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Following an appropriate local greeting, we might say: “As troubles in the world mount, honest-hearted persons look for a remedy. Some say man will find a solution. Others say that only God can do so and that things will get better only after Christ’s return or second coming. What does the Bible say about the purpose of Christ’s return? Matthew 25:31, 32 says: . . . [Read]. Thus we see that Christ’s return is a time for judgment. He is going to separate sheeplike ones from goatlike ones. How important it is, then, to cultivate a sheeplike disposition, showing a willingness to be led by Jesus, in order to get a favorable judgment. Will we see him when he returns? John 14:19 answers that question for us when it says: . . . [Read]. So it is clear that persons here on the earth will not see Christ when he returns, but, rather, his return will be an invisible one. For those who obey his commands, there are blessings that will be enjoyed for eternity. Psalm 72:7, S mentions some of these. [Read. Comment especially on ‘abundance of peace’ and ‘subjects from sea to sea.’] You will undoubtedly want to learn more about Christ’s return and what it means to you. This is one of the purposes of ‘The Watchtower.’ Note the article on this very subject.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The sermon should be discussed with the audience, covering such things as the introduction, comments on scriptures, transitions, etc. Then a well-prepared publisher can demonstrate the sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In different localities you might want to vary the sermon. To facilitate this, “Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,” on pages 167170, lists some very fine texts that can be used to describe the blessings that Christ’s return will bring. Also, you might need additional material, either to answer questions that are raised or to use on follow-up calls, and this, too, can be found under the heading “Return of Christ” in both “Make Sure” and “Sermon Outlines.” Of course, we will want to be careful and avoid long, complicated and possibly argumentative discussions. Be sure to keep the subject simple, clear and helpful. In this connection we will all want to watch for the articles that will be published in “The Watchtower&quot; during the campaign that will tie in nicely with the sermon. Each article will cover a different aspect of the subject of Christ’s return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some may want to offer just the “Watchtower” subscription, but some have found that both subscriptions (with six booklets), on a contribution of $2, are obtained as easily as one. 10 min: Concluding comments. Song 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Theme: Putting the Worship of the True God First. Song 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Discuss, too, the theme for the month, &quot;Putting the Worship of the True God First.” (See the January 1, 1966, “Watchtower,” page 30.) 15 min: Stimulating talk on the yeartext, “We Should Not Neglect the House of Our God.” (Neh. 10:39; see the December 15. 1965, “Watchtower.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Discussion, between school servant and another publisher, of the article “A Veritable Treasure-House.” Comment about the publications available in the school library and promote incentive to use this valuable facility. Illustrate how it can be used to find answers to questions and in preparing talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">12 min: “Adding ‘Zip’ to Our Subscriptions.” Question-and-answer coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">8 min: Concluding comments. Please work short demonstration into concluding comments relative to properly handling subscriptions. Song 26.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">What is it that Jehovah encourages us to search for as hidden treasure? Knowledge! (Prov. 2:4. 5) To aid us in this search lie has lovingly provided the Bible and many tine aids in the form of books, magazines, and so forth, published by the Society to help us understand his Word of truth. In addition to a personal library that each of us is encouraged to have, likely many useful publications are available in your Kingdom Hall library.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> A helpful library is one that contains all the Society’s publications that are available. Of course, we want to keep our personal libraries up to date. It would be a tine thing if each family had a well-balanced library at home. In addition, many families have found it beneficial for each family member, wherever possible, to have his own personal copy of more recent publications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> At the Kingdom Hall, the school servant, under the direction of the overseer, can see that the library has sufficient publications to answer our Bible questions. The school servant can supervise matters in connection with keeping the library neat and orderly and making any additions to the collection of publications already available. Among useful publications that can be included in the Kingdom Hall library would be </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Th e Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">\icake!</span><span class="font16"> bound volumes, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Inder, </span><span class="font16">an English-language dictionary, a good Bible dictionary, a concordance, and so forth.</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Early in December, the overseer and magazine-territory servant ought to discuss the magazine-territory servant’s activity and especially how the magazine-territory servant can help the congregation to reach its goal of twelve magazines per publisher. Also, consideration can be given to developing more magazine routes. Possibly an increase of the magazine order for the months ahead should be discussed. O At meetings for field service during December the following suggestions may be used if they fit your needs locally: December 12, review the simplified sermon in November </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> and adapt to current offer. December 19, talking points useful in placing either the new book or the Bible in your territory. December 26, useful suggestions as to what to say if people are very busy on a holiday weekend. January 2, briefly review the new sermon for the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O It is recommended that overseers make field service arrangements for holiday witnessing. On December 25. either the regular offer or magazines may be used. For January 1, the Society suggests full support of Magazine Day. On January 2, it is rec</span><span class="font16">when doing research we can always make a note of the references that are shown in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font16"> and then before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall we can use the more extensive facilities available there. Perhaps arrangements can be made for a greater use of these facilities at. other times if such is felt necessary, by talking to the congregation overseer or the school servant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> As we seek more of God's spirit to accomplish our work we need knowledge, and there is a great treasure-house of knowledge in the Bible and in the publications of the Society. If we incline our heart to discernment, and call out for understanding, we can be sure that Jehovah will richly bless our efforts.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Report from China</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> On October 30 we had a grand meeting at Yankee Stadium in New York, at which 34,708 gathered on short notice to hear Brother Stanley Jones, who had just been released from prison in Communist China. All of us who were there were deeply moved by the things that we heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">-’After enjoying that spiritually upbuilding morning together, many wrote expressions of appreciation to the Society for it. Said one brother in his letter to Brother Knorr: “Having had the privilege of attending all the assemblies at Yankee Stadium. I found that each one has had its own special blessings . . . Yet I was not moved to write this note of thanks by those assemblies, even though they hold a very special and dear place in my life as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I was moved by a fine and humble, loving discussion by Brother Jones in his almost ‘matter-of-fact* way of describing how he kept his faith strong in seven years of confinement in Red China’s prisons. Yet as I thought about it. 1 was even more moved, or ‘overwhelmed’ as Brother Jones said, by your deep and obvious desire to see to it that as many people as possible could actually hear this experience.”</span></p>

This edition is already being shipped out, and by January 1 orders may be placed for both the French and the Portuguese editions. Do you have people in your territory who speak ! these languages? If so, be sure to call on them with the new book | in their own language. People of ! all kinds are responding well to this fine new publication. The State Fair Unit in Detroit, Michigan, recently wrote to say: “Since the London, Ontario, assembly our local brothers have already placed 310 copies of this publication, and this in a 95 percent Catholic territory.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> It has been a pleasure to us to observe how enthusiastically everyone has been working with the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font16"> book. Already over two million copies have been shipped from Brooklyn, and we are currently making shipments from the third million.

<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> During the holiday season we will no doubt meet many busy people. Experience has shown that we need to discern the circumstances. Is the householder entertaining guests? Well, put yourself in his place; how would you feel if someone interrupted you when you were busy with a number of guests in the house? So we can be considerate in cases such as this, perhaps offering the magazines and suggesting that we call at another time. Still some are not sincerely busy : and when we discern this really to be the case, we may be able tactfully to overcome the objection and proceed with a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> There are, of course, other times we can show consideration. A householder may object, saying, “I don’t believe the same things that you do.” Would you meet this objection “head on,” pointing out that the beliefs of the householder are unscriptural? Well, we have observed that most people do not respond favorably to a blunt reply; and really before we call on them, we know they do not believe the same things that we do. We come to present the good news of</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> In a few months the Society’s Magazine Department will be filing all subscriptions for the United States by zip code rather than by city and state. During the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> campaign thousands of subscriptions are received daily, and heretofore it has been necessary to check each slip to be sure the zip number is correct. Therefore, if you are uncertain or cannot accurately the Kingdom to them. So, rather than making an issue over the comment, might it not be the course of wisdom and the considerate thing to acknowledge it, perhaps emphasize interests that we do have in common and then proceed with our presentation, when this is possible?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> You might say: “We realize that people have different beliefs, and, of course, everyone has a right to his own beliefs. However, our work is one of Bible education. We feel that no matter what belief a person has. each of us can benefit from the good message presented in the Bible. So the purpose of our calling today is to point out briefly what the Bible says on such and such a subject.” Then, if possible, you can proceed with your chosen theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> If we show consideration for other people, knowing that they have their own beliefs, discerning that they are sincerely busy at times, they will often be more at ease when we call and more attentive in listening to what we have to say. So be alert to show consideration for others, while you enthusiastically present the good news to all who will listen.</span></p></li></ul>

The accounts servant can assist by checking each slip for overall accuracy and legibility, as well as making sure the zip code is correct. But how can he do this in large cities or when the territory covers many post-office towns?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Each congregation may obtain a free copy of the Postal Zip Code Directory for its city by writing to the Postmaster in care of its city and state. To obtain the zip numbers for small towns, list the post offices in your territory on a sheet of paper and request the Postmaster to supply rhe proper numbers for each town. Then, before sending subscription slips to the Society, the accounts servant can check them against his list of towns or check the street addresses in the Directory he has obtained from the post office.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">Recently the Society published a new book, “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” This book contains basic information that all persons should study. Indeed, it would be advisable for newly interested persons to study through this book, if it is printed in their language, before making a dedication, because then they will have a reasonable understanding of fundamental Bible teachings and a strong intellectual foundation for faith. They should also learn the principles set forth in “This Means Everlasting Life.” After that, recently dedicated persons who are conscious of their spiritual need will continue to study the Bible with the Society’s publications, and there are many available that all should be anxious to read personally so they can progress toward spiritual maturity, in harmony with Hebrews 6:1, 2.</span></p>

Well, that shows a fine heart condition, a right desire. Really, most of us wish we could do more. But if, during December, we each manage to share in the service ourselves and aid one other person who needs help to go in the service with us, what a tremendous work will be done by the organization as a whole! Then, when you have had a share in the ministry, don’t forget to turn in your report—as early as possible.</span></p>

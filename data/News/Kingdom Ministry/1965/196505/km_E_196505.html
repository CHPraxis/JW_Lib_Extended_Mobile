<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)ea/t</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">Now that the big events of April are past, we can’t help but wonder how many came to your Memorial. Did you have a good attendance for the special public meeting too? And, finally, how many newly interested persons did you help in preaching the good news? You’re just as interested in knowing as we are, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of course, each of us knows what happened in his own congregation. Our congregation servants keep us right up to date week by week as to our progress. All the brothers and sisters are to be commended for their labors of love, regardless of how much time they spent in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When we learn of the grand witness given by all of God's people around the world in April, it certainly will make us feel good for having helped in some small way. It gives us a consciousness, too, that what we are trying to get done, that is, preaching the good news in all the earth, is really being accomplished to the honor of Jehovah’s name. We also know that Jehovah is pleased with what is being done, because he blesses us so richly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Isn’t it true that Jehovah always has something new for us to look forward to? In just another month the conventions begin in Europe and North America. We sincerely hope that all of you will be able to attend one of them. The theme of the assembly, “ ‘Word of Truth’ Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses,” is enough to excite any person. We have heard that the keynote speech is going to be given on Thursday night of the assembly. No one will want to miss that. Everyone ought to have a notebook in hand when the chairman opens the convention at two o’clock that afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The conventions are so arranged that it will not take very long to get to an assembly. For us here in New York we will be getting something a little extra special. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> says that, while the</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">Become Full-grown</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> It is indeed a wonderful thing to watch a child grow, gain understanding and maturity. Those of you who are parents may appreciate this most. However, have you ever thought what a delight it must be to Jehovah as he sees us grow spiritually? Yes, and because we love Jehovah and love life we want to keep growing spiritually, don’t we? (1 Cor. 14:20) But the question is, How? What must we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the case of a child, food is needed. For spiritual growth we need food too, spiritual food. Do you get that needed food? How are you doing on your Bible reading? Do you look forward to attending each meeting arranged by the congregation? Do you listen closely and take part? We need to keep well-fed spiritually to become full-grown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Just as it takes time for good food to nourish the body, and this is accomplished only if the food is assimilated, so it is with spiritual food. It has been observed that many who study well spend only half of their time reading. They spend the conventions in the U.S.A, will be four days, the New York convention will be for six days. Maybe that is because Brothers Franz and Knorr will be getting back from Europe in time for the Yankee Stadium convention and they will be able to tell us something about what happened over there. Then, of course, Gilead School is right here in Brooklyn, and we would not be a bit surprised if some of the program involved the students. You know, that has happened before at conventions in Yankee Stadium. We’ll wait and see. The only trouble is, New York has the last assembly instead of the first one. So all the rest of the United States and Europe will know what happened at the conventions before the brothers at the New York convention will know. But we look forward other half of their study time meditating, making personal application of the material to themselves, deciding what changes they need to make in their lives and thinking in order to comply with the material they have studied, figuring out how and where they can use the material studied. Yes, meditation and discussing the truth with others have much to do with becoming full-grown spiritually, don’t they?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Then there is a need for exercise both for physical growth and for spiritual growth. We all know that if we do not use the material we study we soon forget it. So we need to keep busy commenting at meetings, taking our parts on the programs and sharing in field service. And there is much we can do along these lines during the month of May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> During May we have a fine offer. What do you know about </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Cod Be True”?</span><span class="font13"> Is it one of the first books you studied? Were you aided to learn much of the truth with its help? Did you know that over 900,-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col. 1) </span><span class="font13">to enjoying the feast along with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Brother Knorr told us that he was leaving for Europe the Monday after Memorial. He will be gone for about three weeks, visiting convention cities to work out the final details for the five-day assemblies they are having over there. Isn’t it exciting to think that the first convention of the year has been arranged for Dublin, Eire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The assemblies will be here before we know it, and we will want to encourage the newly interested persons to get to an assembly with us. But before we get to any assembly we will be looking forward to receiving your April report. The good news reflected in that report we will tell you all about in the June </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font13"> J/ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">in istry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Become Full-grown. Song 80. 15 min: Introduction, text and comments. As this is concluded, the one handling the part covers points in Branch Letter. Interviews several family heads who are enthusiastic about attending assembly this summer. Specific mention is made of benefits to entire family, such as wholesome association, new things learned, aid to family maturity and pleasant trip to assembly. Other pertinent points in the Branch Letter discussed and application made to congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: “Assemblies in 1965.&quot; Ques-tion-and-answer coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16 min: “Become Full-grown.&quot; Discussion of article, with audience participation. Have everyone look up 1 Corinthians 14:20 and invite comments from audience. If appropriate, have parents answer questions on paragraphs one through four, children and younger publishers on paragraphs five and six, and servants and study conductors on paragraphs seven through nine. Read key paragraphs, if time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Presenting the Good News. Please demonstrate the following points: (1) Simplified sermon. (2) Transitions to older books. (3) Helpful talking points therein. Stress ease of offer and, if possible, use younger publishers to demonstrate some of these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts servant’s report. Also, cover “How Did We Do in March?&quot; and local report for April. Commend those who vacation pioneered in April. Song 61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Strengthen One Another in Love. Song 68.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 min: Demonstration. Strengthening the Basic Unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Excellent example being set by many families in Jehovah’s organization. Warmly commends them for their fine work. Family, basic unit of New World society. Strong families make strong congregations. Practical family schedule including all members key to success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (4 min.) Chairman interviews study conductor who has practical family schedule, with all children active and meeting ten-hour goal. Discuss together progress family is making. Warmly encourage the use of a schedule by all. Entire family appreciates schedule. Has helped them to reach goals. Happier now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (10 min.) Study conductor talks with parents who themselves do fairly well in the service but whose children have low activity. Parents ask for assistance. Conductor glad to offer suggestions, but reminds parents he cannot tell them what decisions to make concerning their children. Parents feel some of the children are too young; in time will include them in various features of ministry. Conductor points out children learn quickly; use examples. They can excel in developing magazine routes, learning simplified sermons, and, as they grow up, advancing in knowledge, can make back-calls and conduct studies. He shows how family unity and togetherness are created by setting aside time for field service, family study and attending meetings together, as W’ell as by balanced recreation. Jehovah blesses those “keeping a set way.” (Ps. 50:23) Father feels he is “too busy.&quot; He is reminded that world has great drawing power, parents must compete with this for the attention of the children. Necessary training starts when they are young, involves every aspect of life. Where training consistently given, children are happy, family unity developed, and children progress in the ministry. Father and mother see reasonableness of this and, together with conductor, they work out practical family schedule. Children come in and voice their willingness to cooperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Life of children and parents depends on activity in righteousness.—Prov. 10:16, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on “Materialism—A dly Philosophy.” (March 1, 1965, “Watchtower”) Stress definition of materialism on page 135. Emphasize that Christians must always be on guard to prevent the crowding out of the more important spiritual values. Endeavor to be upbuilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Demonstration. Aid More to Conduct Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Mature brother, preferably Bible study servant, encourages more to share in Bible study work. In U.S.A, about 41 percent of publishers share, which leaves some 175,000 who do not. How does local congregation compare? Stress need for more to share and the blessings that will result. Publisher from audience would like a study. Has tried but no studies have resulted. Servant invites him to go along with him; has a back-call he is going to make. Will use simple back-call sermon below to start study, and the two will go together several times till new study is well established and publisher feels confident of taking it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(7 min.) After initial greetings and inviting self in—‘John 17:3 tells us that taking in knowledge is necessary for everlasting life. [Read.] We certainly want everlasting life, don’t we? Notice it says we need knowledge of the only true God. If I were to hand you the Bible and ask you to read me the scriptures that would give us that knowledge, it might be difficult to locate just what you want, isn’t that right? But the booklet I left with you gives such helpful information. [Invite them to get Bible and “Good News” booklet.] Notice in paragraph 5 under “The True God&quot; it gives us some scriptures to look up. What is the first scripture? [Await answer.] Let’s look it up. [Consider all scriptures in this paragraph, then discuss the question. Do same with paragraph 6, if appropriate. Emphasize Jehovah’s name. After fitting comment, use John 17:3 as basis for arranging next discussion, somethinglike thisj Remember, John 17:3 said there was someone else we should know about too. Who was that? [Look up John 17:3 again.] That’s right, Jesus Christ. We will need scriptures for this too, won’t we? Notice our next heading, “Jesus Christ.&quot; When I come back, I know you would enjoy looking up some of these scriptures. Would this same time next week be convenient? [Arrange definite appointment, if possible.]’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>(</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.y Publisher expresses appreciation. Will accompany servant several weeks till study is well established. Is thankful for assistance. Really wants to share in Bible study work. Servant encourages all publishers apt at starting Bible studies to aid others as was demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Concluding comments. Cover slogan on page one. Song 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Following the True Guide. Song 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments. Study conductor discusses text with newer publisher. Encourages him to read it each day as an aid for growing to maturity. (Heb. 6:1) Publisher wants to develop spiritually and thanks study conductor for continued interest in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on “Finding Answers to Your Bible Questions,” from February 15, 1965, “Watchtower,” pages 124-127. Tie in appropriate comments on the theme of meeting. Tn introducing next part, show that our continued growth to spiritual maturity will aid us to become strong in the truth and will help prevent lapsing into inactivity. 17 min: &quot;Go On Doing It in Fuller Measure.” Questions and answers and demonstration of points appropriate to congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk including material in Questions from Readers, page 639, October 15, 1964, &quot;Watchtower.&quot; Emphasize in an encouraging way the responsibility each one has to conduct himself properly so as to keep organization clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Concluding comments. Include suggestions on organizing special magazine distribution at cemeteries, where advisable. A tract such as “Hope for the Dead” may be used when magazines are not taken. Be tactful and friendly in this work. Also, please cover slogan on page 4. Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: &quot;Make Our Discipleship Known by Brotherly Love.&quot; Song 52. 12 min: Introduction, text and comments and talk on monthly theme. (See “Watchtower” of June 1, 1965.) 20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Your Family Responsibilities and the Pioneer Ministry.” (January “Kingdom Ministry” insert) Please summarize all paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Cover Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Demonstration on use of “New World Translation” and “All Scripture” book. Last December's offer of Bible and &quot;All Scripture&quot; book brought excellent results. Many had thrilling experiences. To prepare us for June campaign, Society suggests following: Mature brother, several weeks in advance, selects three or four publishers (perhaps two young publishers, housewife, servant or study conductor) to locate fine talking points on &quot;All Scripture” book. Each one selects several points that appeal to him. Chairman then interviews them: keeps part lively and informative. Would be good to have in mind type of territory and objections common to that locality. Then chairman calls for two short presentations, featuring transition from last scripture of sermon (same one as for May) to appealing points in publication. One presentation can deal with Bible and book; other \vith book alone. Warmly encourages each publisher in congregation to try to place at least one set during month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Concluding comments. Include talk on material in the Question Box. Song 45.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Go On Doing It in Fuller Measure&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Go on doing what? you may ask. Showing brotherly love. (1 Thess. 4:9, 10) You do show such love: this is characteristic of Jehovah’s people. This shows your unselfish interest in one another, and truly this is fine. We know, too, that it is your desire, if possible, to show your brotherly love in fuller measure, as the apostle Paul urged the congregation of the Thessalonians. But you may wonder how. Well, if there are some brothers in your congregation who have become inactive, could you take a little time to help them? We know their spiritual lives are in jeopardy, and surely we want to aid them if we can, don’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But first of all, to help an inactive one we must understand him. In this connection the apostle Peter gives us some helpful insight into causes of inactivity. After listing faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godly devotion, brotherly affection and love, he went on to say, “If these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">inactive</span><span class="font13"> or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Pet. 1:5-8) There we have it. Inactivity usually results from a lack of one or more of these Christian qualities. We might say that inactive ones are spiritually ill. By giving them our loving aid, we can nurse them back to spiritual health.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> When someone is physically ill, wouldn’t it be kind and loving on our part to pay a friendly visit? We wouldn't think of scolding or embarrassing him, would we? Now, would we want to be any less considerate when visiting one who is spiritually disheartened? Truly our desire is to show extraordinary brotherly love, realizing that it</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> But. what could we say? Very likely you will want to express your genuine concern for his spiritual welfare. Commendation may be fitting. And just as a physician listens carefully to ascertain his patient’s problem, we need to do the same. We may even have to take the initiative discreetly to draw this information out. Once we understand what is hindering our brother we will be able to build him up and give Scriptural encouragement. We may find it wise to invite him to the meetings before urging him into the ministry. Or we might conclude that starting a home Bible study with him will be just what is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We may find that some prematurely began to publish without having a firm foundation of accurate knowledge. Others may have encountered opposition and, through fear, stopped publishing. Some may have let their love grow cold because of lack of personal study and prayer. They may be stumbling over certain doctrines or because of what someone said or did. It could be that some have even returned to some improper practice of the old world. Ir may require patience on our part to get to the root of the problem. Possibly many visits will be required. But our desire is to give loving encouragement and kind, Scriptural counsel, showing how to conquer fear with love, how to overcome human weaknesses and assume responsibility.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>e</sup> We know that some of you are already doing these things, and this is most heartwarming. In any event, let us all continue to show our brotherly love in every way and at all times. Surely this will be pleasing to Jehovah and strengthening to all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Undoubtedly, as a result of this fine work, many were helped to come to the special talk on April 4 as well as the Memorial. What a splendid foundation for more Bible studies! Keep up the good work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Assemblies in 1965</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> You have probably given some consideration to attending the 1965 district assemblies, and perhaps you have selected the one you wish to attend. The important thing is to be there to enjoy all the rich spiritual blessings that Jehovah has in store for his ministers and also for the fellowship one can enjoy with his brothers assembled for pure worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The Society is now sending Room Request forms to the congregations. It would be well for you to consider the instructions on the Room Request form about six to eight weeks prior to the assembly in your area. When they have been filled out by the publishers, they should be mailed to the city where they expect to attend, NOT TO THE SOCIETY.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Also, your congregation will receive Volunteer Service forms. All desiring to assist and serve the brothers at the assembly should fill out this form completely. Then give it to your congregation servant, who will sign it and mail it to the convention city where you expect to attend. As you well know from attending assemblies in the past, there is a great deal of work required for a convention to function successfully. This service is a joyful one and-an excellent opportunity to assist your brothers and to manifest love to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Those who speak Spanish will be glad to know that there will be programs in Corpus Christi, Tex.; Albuquerque, N.M.: San Diego, Calif.: St. Petersburg, Fla., and New York, N.Y. The assembly at Corpus Christi will have a Spanish program only, while the other cities will have the Spanish assembly in conjunction with the English one. The program will be complete in all cases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Advertising of the assembly can be done en route to the convention city by obtaining and wearing attractive lapel cards as you have done in the past. The card will fit the holder that you used before, in this connection we suggest that the congregation servants </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">be sure </span><span class="font13">to order the cards and celluloid holders to accommodate the needs of the congregation. The cards cost 1c each, and the celluloid holders 5c each. If you need them, you can also order the cards printed in the Spanish language. There will be no bumper signs this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If you have not already made definite plans for attending the assembly this summer, do so immediately. Perhaps you can also assist others to attend, having in mind those tliat are newly associating with Jehovah’s organization. Without fail, be sure that the 1965 convention is on your agenda.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Older Books</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What a pleasure it will be to offer the older books during May! You may have some ideas on how to present this offer in a simple way, but here are a few suggestions we hope you will find useful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> After an appropriate greeting you could say: “The purpose of my visit is to discuss briefly the Bible’s promise of a better system of things here on earth. Please notice what the scripture at Revelation 21:4, 5 says about mankind’s common enemy being destroyed. [Read. I” Another approach, using a simplified sermon, could be: “The purpose of my brief call is to encourage more Bible reading. The importance of taking in accurate knowledge from God’s Word is certainly stressed by Jesus’ words at John 17:3. [Read.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> But to be effective we need an appropriate transition to the publication being offered. If </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font13"> is being used, we could say: “This Bible-study aid shows where we can get some very encouraging information about the conditions that will exist on earth in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Become Full-grown &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">000 persons have come to a knowledge of the truth since it was published? Many of these were aided by studying </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.&quot; </span><span class="font13">We have every reason to offer it with confidence along with a booklet for 50c, don’t we? Of course, we will stress the spiritual benefits and point out the many different subjects interested persons can learn with the aid of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.&quot;</span><span class="font13"> It has been of value to us and it will be of value to them too.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We would like all of you to place every copy of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot; </span><span class="font13">you have; then help neighboring congregations to use all that they have. Let’s get every copy of this book into the hands of persons who can benefit from it. When </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font13"> is gone, you may use </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.&quot;</span><span class="font13"> When these are gone, you may use any of the older 50c books you wish. If all of your books are gone, you can even use four older booklets for 10c. So there will be no running out of good things to offer, will there?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> On the matter of demonstrating our growth, do you have a Bible promised better system of things.” Then read and discuss appropriate points from page 267.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When offering </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font13"> we might say: “Jesus himself stressed the importance of taking in accurate knowledge. On page ten this publication refers to the scripture at John 17: 3, which says: [Read scripture and the rest of paragraph six.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When planning your service during May, let your mind go back a few years to when you first heard the truth. What was it that attracted you? Was it not the warm and friendly manner of the person who spoke to you and the simple and uncomplicated way in which the truth was presented? Interested persons to whom you talk will more than likely respond in a favorable manner if you have these essential qualities. Where possible, give them the full sermon. Where necessary, use one of these simpler presentations. We hope you will have some excellent experiences in the field during May, and we pray that Jehovah will be with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">study with an interested person outside your family? Regularly conducting a study with another person is a fine way to show spiritual maturity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> And another thing about conducting studies: if you prepare well and conduct them each week you will find that you learn even more than the householder does. That’s right. Try it and you will find it a great aid to your becoming full-grown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> But back to the matter of helping others. Our brothers need encouragement and help too. With maturity and growth comes strength, and the apostle Paul tells us that those of us who are strong ought to be assisting those who are not so strong. So who can you help? A member of your family? Someone in your service center? One of the new ones? If there is any question in your mind concerning whom you can help, ask the overseer for his suggestion. May Jehovah bless you in your busy activity in May as you all make progress toward full growth, to your delight and to the delight of your heavenly Father.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>'a^uestion U$ox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">* Should we share the conducting' of funerals with ministers of false religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s people are pleased to give comfort to bereaved families and to help them to appreciate the wonderful hope of the resurrection. However, if we actually shared the service with religious clergymen, it could very well leave confusion in the minds of those present. Why? Because it would give the appearance of interfaith. (2 Cor. 6:14-17) In view of this and because of our position toward Babylon the Great in general, it would seem inadvisable to take a funeral under these circumstances. All arrangements for the funeral should be inquired about beforehand so embarrassing circumstances do not prevail at the time of the funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, there might be occasions when tw’o services will be held, with perhaps one in the evening and one in the morning. There would be no objection to handling one of these two services separately. This would give us a fine opportunity to give a witness to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some have asked whether it is proper for us to attend funerals of relatives or friends in churches of Christendom. Very likely many will feel that they prefer not to attend the service in a church of Christendom. However, if some conscientiously feel that they can attend, then as long as they do not participate in the apostate ritual, this is up to them to decide. In the last analysis, it is up to each individual’s enlightened Christian conscience, and each one will have to decide for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When -we conduct funeral services they should be reported as public talks.</span></p>

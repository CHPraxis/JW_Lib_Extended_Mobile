<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER, 1965</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.’’—Matt. 10:28.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>dealt \Je^ow</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">^Witnesses Jeliovair</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Wasn’t it wonderful? The “Word of Truth” Assembly thrilled all of us. At Yankee Stadium we had an extra portion because the instructors and students of Gilead School had two full days on the program. The classroom was at second base, on the platform, and to watch the students in action was thrilling! During language classes the audience as a whole was pronouncing words, saying even Chinese and Japanese sounds. We had a good time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The school lecture periods during the two days were of great interest. Brother Franz gave an outstanding talk on the hook of Ruth. Then I spoke, the second day of school, on “Making the Most of Your Opportunities.” Of course, the principles could be applied to all of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On Friday, 1,361 new ministers were immersed. Then on Sunday the public meeting drew an audience of 74,649. It was good to see Yankee Stadium packed out again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As was true at all the assemblies this summer, Saturday’s meeting was outstanding, because then the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for Jlod to Lie”</span><span class="font12"> was presented. But along with the release of that book in English we also had the release of it in Spanish. When our Spanish-speaking brothers, who were meeting in tents about a block south of the stadium, learned that the book was available in Spanish as well as in English, a tremendous applause went up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society is very anxious to get this new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie' </span><span class="font12">distributed quickly. You already know that consignments of the new book were shipped to every congregation in the United States. The publishers on the West Coast have been using the new book in the field service since the end of June, .just as our brothers in England, Scotland and Eire have been doing. Wonderful reports are coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Eire, where only 66 books a month, on an average, were placed in 1964, they placed 108 in July—a new peak for Eire. The brothers in Eire are enthusiastic about this book. The British Isles received 150,000 copies, but already an additional 50,000 have been ordered. Throughout Canada 76,000 copies were consigned to congregations, and already the congregations have ordered another 10,000. Here in the United States too, congregations have been ordering heavily. This means the truth is being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I received a letter the other day from England. The brother wrote: “I just cannot help writing to express my unbounded happiness and enthusiasm on receipt of the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font12"> I read it. Perhaps it would be more correct to say revelled in it.” Do you feel that way? I think you do. Right now there are at least 530,000 English-and Spanish-speaking witnesses of Jehovah who will be working with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font12"> book. Do you think that during October, November and December they could place one and a half million copies of this book? Shall we try?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Furthermore, by 1966 we should have this book well along in ten more tongues. Many translators have worked long extra hours on the book so as to speed up the printing of it for their brothers. The Italian translation is already set on the linotype. We hope to print this edition in October, and bind it sometime in November. Watch the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> for an announcement as to when you may order it. The French and Portuguese translations came in and are completely set on the linotype. The Swedish brothers say they are going to mail the completed translation in November. The Dutch have promised it in September, the Danish in October, the Greeks in November, the Norwegians in December. The German brothers write that they hope to print the new book in Wiesbaden, Germany, by late November. The Finnish brothers do their own printing, and they plan to get the book out in Finland by next May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Think of it—we are going to have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font12"> book in twelve languages, and soon. Then all of Europe, North and South America and the greater number of the people in Africa and the islands of the sea will have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font12"> book available to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society is trying to do everything possible to get this book to the brothers as quickly as it can be done. We feel the urgency of the matter. There must be many more people in the world who will accept the truth after they read these wonderful truths presented so logically, and what joy we are going to have in studying this new book with them in their own homes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We feel that if millions of people study this book world wide, it will have a profound effect on our Kingdom activity. The distribution of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font12"> book began at the assemblies this summer. There were 506,950 persons in attendance at just those conventions announced in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> and 8.592 were baptized. Here is a strong contingent of new ministers that will be working right along with the rest of us in presenting this new book and other publications to the people in order to help them to get a clear knowledge of God's Word of Truth. What joy is ours as God’s ordained ministers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now that October is here we will be using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine, but we will always carry the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font12"> book with us. We may be able to place one during the month, and then we will make November our big month with the new book. This wonderful publication </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Im possible for God to Lie''</span><span class="font12"> should be a real aid in getting new Bible studies started. We believe that Jehovah will bless all of us richly as we witness with the use of this fine publication. Be assured of my prayers and Christian love and best wishes for all of you as we help men get saved from this crooked generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brother,</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER (For those having<sup>-</sup> Friday meetings this will be the third.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Interest All Sorts of Men. Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include one or two local experiences from magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Get Them Personally Involved.” Questions and answers. All publishers bring copies of special “Awake!” and, following questions and answers on “Kingdom Ministry” article, invite them to express themselves on points they use from this magazine to get people involved, interested. Point out how this will benefit people spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23 min: Presenting Magazines Effectively to All.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(3 min.) This demonstration may be briefly introduced by chairman, showing need for parents to take interest in ministry of their children and aid them in a practical way to present the magazines effectively and to have a right view of magazine activity, not merely as a placing of magazines but as a means to praise Jehovah and aid sincere persons to gain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Father, mother and young teen-age children prepare themselves for magazine work, considering articles in October 15 “Watchtower.” Parents explain how to get people involved in consideration of subject when presenting magazines. Mother and daughter rehearse presentation, daughter presenting magazines and mother taking part of householder. Daughter handles presentation, and householder rudely refuses to take magazines. Father then steps in and lovingly offers counsel, showing that we do not place something at every door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Family goes into the actual field service, father working with son and mother with daughter. They use House-to-House Record for placements. Each pair makes two presentations to different kinds of people: older man, businessman, housewife, younger man. In each case they effectively get them involved in some article in either October 8 “Awake!” or October 15 “Watchtower.” Father and son place magazines with younger man and make notations on House-to-House Record. Father explains how important it is to follow up where interest is shown. In conclusion chairman sums up, showing the importance of family training and parental leadership for productive ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2 min: Report by accounts servant. 10 min: “How Did We Do in August?” Also local report, including number of subscriptions obtained so far in October. Concluding comments. Song 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER (For those having Friday meetings this will be the fourth.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Appreciating Jehovah’s Provisions for Service. Song 88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: “Appreciating Our Service Centers.” Questions and answers with reading of paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Question Box. A talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17 min: Following Up on Magazine Placements</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Word of Truth certainly featured in magazines. Why not call back on those who obtain magazines to offer further spiritual help? Many who read the magazines want them again. Some will want to subscribe; others will be glad to have you deliver copies regularly. In some cases Bible studies can be started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (3 min.) Same father-and-son team from previous week’s program. They are at home checking over House-to-House Record, preparing sermon on “Meaning of World Conditions,” and talking about articles in October 22 “Awake!” Son feels he can effectively use article entitled “Benefit from Suggestions.” Father comments on another article. Both enthused about having a full share in “Awake!” campaign. Both appreciate importance of being alert to start Bible studies wherever possible; this is our goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Father and son now ready to make back-call where magazines placed previous week. Same householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (8 min.) Son gives sermon and leads into discussion of “Good News” booklet. Householder impressed, but rather busy. He did enjoy magazines placed before. Publisher briefly explains that he can get both “Watchtower” and “Awake!” by mail for $2 a year. Subscriptions obtained. Leave on friendly note, indicating when they will return to speak more on these things. When outside, father asks son what he would have done if subscriptions had not been obtained. Son replies that he would have directed attention of householder back to booklet to keep alive the prospect for developing a study. Father commends him for fine attitude toward ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Asks audience what they learned from demonstration. Answers should include comments on following points: (1) Preparation important. (2) Purpose of calls is to aid persons spiritually; start study, if possible. (3) Be alert to opportunities to arrange for spiritual food to go to homes of interested ones regularly. (4) Good for parents to commend children for progress made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Magazine-territory servant emphasizes value of building up routes, showing how it provides spiritual food for householders and affords many opportunities for Bible discussions with publisher; possibly leading to home Bible studies. Mentions progress of subscription campaign to date, also how many individual copies of magazines placed so far. Refers to slogan on page 4. Are we averaging one a day? Have we offered subscriptions and/or copies of the magazines to tradesmen, visitors, friends, etc.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Consider applicable Announcements. Concluding comments. Remind everyone to bring new book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” next week. Song 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FOURTH MEETING IN OCTOBER (For those having Friday meetings this will be the fifth.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Tell Men It Is Impossible for God to Lie. Song 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments discussed by two persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">30 min: Letter from Brothei’ Knorr. Questions and answers with reading of paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Know What Is in It.” (All in attendance should have their copy of new book for this part.) Group sitting together in a home consider new book. Various publishers should be prepared to bring out points especially applicable to our field service, whether house-to-house calls or back-calls and Bible studies. For example: First chapter establishes existence of living God and Creator; bring out high points. Chapter two gives evidence that the Bible is true. These are essential foundation points on which to build accurate knowledge through our field service. Other high points may be selected from book as applicable to the kind of people and thinking in your territory, for you have been using this book for some time now. Charts and pictures may be mentioned. Conclude with expressions on value of knowing what is in the new book in order to be able to use it effectively in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments, including expression of appreciation for new book. Song 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Witnessing for the God of True Prophecy. Song 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on November theme, “Witnessing for the God of True Prophecy.” (See “The Watchtower,” November 1, 1965.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Presenting the Good News. Two persons walk onto platform and immediately demonstrate new sermon and how it ties in with new book. Afterward brother taking part of publisher will analyze it with congregation to make points stick. What did we do? Why did we do it that way? What are the main points made in Presenting the Good News?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Starting Studies in the New Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) Chairman mentions that we have already had the book for weeks and many have been placed. Real benefits come in territory when studies are begun. What points can we best use in our territory to get new studies going? Listen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(6 min.) Two publishers discussing thought-provoking questions that can be raised with people to lead them into a $tudy of the book. How can we prove there is a God and Creator? What is some evidence that the Bible is true? Why does man die and what hope is there for future life? Why does God permit wickedness and suffering upon the earth? Is there a Devil? What is the future of mankind? These are but a few of the questions answered in the new book. We can show how there is so much talk nowadays about increases in godlessness and communism in the world, and faith in God is put in danger. Knowledge builds up faith and strengthens belief in God. It is a protection. Parents need to have answers when children ask questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(7 min.) After two publishers discuss points they use to lead into a study of first chapter in the book, chairman opens up discussion to entire audience and gets actual experiences from publishers who have already started studies in the book, showing how it was done and what it was that aroused interest to the point where a study could be begun. Arrange in advance to be sure at least two are prepared to speak up. Everyone should try to start a study in the new book this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 14.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Appreciating Our Service Centers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In arranging so that al! of us can have personal assistance from mature brothers in the organization when we need it, Jehovah has been very kind to us, hasn’t he? The service centers today provide such individual attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We have all observed Jehovah’s blessing on this arrangement. In our own localities we can see how the activity of the service center contributes to the spiritual health of the entire congregation. And through the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> we have learned that these small groups have proved invaluable when the work has had to go underground. The service center arrangement obviously helps to keep the organization healthy and growing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you were asked to explain why you appreciate the service center, what reasons would you give? No doubt you would mention the marvelous things that you learn at the congregation book study itself, and the personal benefit that conies from studying with a small group where each one comments often. You would probably also say that you appreciate how encouraging it is to meet with a group for service, that you are glad the meeting for service is comparatively near your home, and that the preservice discussion with the group helps you to do a better job in the ministry. But that is not all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We are also appreciative of the hospitality of those who have opened their homes as service centers. It is a fine privilege to have a service center in one’s home, and it results in a grand spiritual blessing to that household, but it also involves extra work. As many as four times each week our brothers receive us hospitably into their homes for congregation book studies and meetings for field service. They greet us warmly and provide us with the comfort of their home. We appreciate what they have done, don’t we? We know that it took effort on their part to do the cleaning, and perhaps the furniture was rearranged for our meeting. How can we show our appreciation for this hospitality? Perhaps we could go a few minutes early and help in setting up the chairs. And wouldn’t it be thoughtful on our part in bad weather to remove our boots or rubbers before entering the house so as not to track in any unnecessary dirt? Then, too, if we avoid sitting on the arms of sofas and chairs, and if we teach our small children to keep their feet off them, the furniture will last much longer, and it shows our appreciation for use of the property of the householder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Also, we need to keep in mind that the home is not ours, and we should not go into other parts of the house unless invited to do so by the householder. We appreciate the hospitality of these brothers of ours, and we don’t want to abuse it, do we?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In traveling to and from the service center we can show our appreciation for this provision of Jehovah too. How is that? By our right conduct. (1 Pet. 2:12) If the neighbors notice us, let it be because of our friendly “hello's,” our regularity and our diligence in the ministry, and not because of any loud and unnecessary noise. Our good conduct may move some of them to listen to the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Clearly, showing appreciation calls for more than words. It requires that we avail ourselves of provisions made and treat them with respect. A reminder of this can help all of us to do it better.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Announcements</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">♦ It is suggested that all congregations make arrangements for a special Magazine Day on November 25, which is the worldly Thanksgiving Day. Any additional magazines needed should be ordered by October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ At meetings for service during October you may use these suggestions if they suit your territory: (1) How to tie in sermon with current magazine articles; (2) overcoming local objections; (3) outstanding points in latest magazine; (4) calling back on all subscription prospects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ The literature offer for November will be a copy of “Things in Which </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font11"> and a booklet, on a contribution of 50 cents. December offer: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font11"> the new book and a booklet, for a contribution of $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Please order now the books you will need for the November and December campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Beginning October 1, all service centers will start studying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </span><span class="font11">and will interrupt their study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font11"> book until the new book is completed once. It would be well for all publishers to finish reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font11"> book if they have not already done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ The No. 11 Bible is out of stock. We have a large supply of bi-22, which is the same Bible trimmed to smaller size, and it will be substituted for bi-11. The price of bi-22 is reduced to the same as for bi-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Early in October the congregation servant should meet with the assistant congregation servant, giving particular attention to arrangements to encourage and assist publishers needing it. During the month they will endeavor to visit all who have become inactive. ♦ New publications available:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of AU Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">—English</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">—Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” —</span><span class="font11">English, Spanish </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom” </span><span class="font11">(Revised) —English, Spanish </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">—English,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Get Them Personally Involved</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When the magazines were presented by a publisher in store-tost ore work recently, a store manager responded by saying: “No, I don’t want any of that stuff around here.” What would you do in such a situation? Well, the publisher replied that it was nice to have been able to visit briefly and maybe lie would see him again sometime. As the publisher was leaving, the store manager called out: “Hey! Wait a minute, I didn’t mean that. I’ll take those magazines.” A brief discussion ensued, with the result that not only were two magazines placed but a half-year subscription was obtained. Why the change? The publisher was friendly. He was interested in terminating the call on a friendly note so (hat the next time someone called possibly the man would be more inclined to listen. The store manager was personally impressed by the publisher's kindly manner. His curiosity was aroused and a Kingdom witness was given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Getting people personally involved is not always easy to do, is it? You may have observed that some publishers have more success in this than others do. Invariably, they have a friendly attitude and are quick to show empathy, and they manifest a keen interest in others. Of course, an attitude such as this will tend to attract. A friendly attitude and a friendly smile go hand in hand. If the publisher has a combination like this, the householder will feel more inclined to express himself; and, when something is said, we will, of course, want to listen and reply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> You have probably found that when a person hands something to you, you automatically reach out and accept it. Have you tried putting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtom r</span><span class="font12"> and . lcc/.c/ magazines into the householder’s hands</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN AUGUST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Look at our very fine report on regular pioneers. For the very first time we climbed above the 9,000 mark, ending the month with 9,073 regular pioneers! Last September the all-time high was 8,538. Thus the grand number- of 535 were added to the pioneer ranks.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Here is a suggestion for a sermon you may use with the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie''</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: The Bible Tells the Truth Concerning Man’s Future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 46:9, 10—Jehovah has foretold the future in the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:17—Jesus recommended the Bible as truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 3:13—Righteous new system of things foretold to replace present wicked system</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> After a friendly introduction, you might say: ‘All of us are concerned with what the future holds for us and our loved ones. Political leaders often make promises about the future, but even if they try to fulfill those promises, they are only human and their ability is limited, isn't it? On the other hand, not only has Jehovah God told us what the future holds, but he is fully able to do the things he has promised. Notice what he says about this in the Bible at Isaiah 4G: 9, 10: . . . [Bead], These things that he says </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Personally Involved &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Coni'd)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">and having him look at them and read a few words? Try it and see how well it works.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Our being well acquainted with the material in the magazines will make it possible to direct attention to something that will be of particular interest to the person with whom we are talking. This is the best way to get him personally involved with the magazines. It does take a little time to prepare in this way, but isn’t it well worth the effort if we can give a more effective witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our being well prepared and keeping things simple will make it easier for the householder to follow our presentation and see its practical value. Tn many cases on Magazine Day you may be able to say what you want in a thirty- to sixty-second presentation. Tn other instances you may feel that more time is required. We should not feel that the length of our presentation is the most important thing. Bather, let us make it our goal to present the Kingdom message in such a way that individuals to whom we talk will become personally involved.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">he will do are recorded in the Bible, and we can have confidence in it because it is impossible for God to lie. Jesus knew this, and at John 17:17 he said: . . . (Bead). This Word of truth, the Bible, tells us that, after God destroys this present wicked system of things, lie will bless God-fearing persons with life in a righteous new system, and this new system of things is promised here at 2 Peter 3:13: . . . [Bead]. We want to be included among those who will live in that righteous new system of things, don’t we? [Allow householder to answer.] To obtain that blessing we need to learn what the Bible says for the guidance of all of us now. This new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font12"> can be a great help to you in gaining that knowledge.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> At this point you may want to show the householder that, in its third chapter, the book presents a vivid synopsis of “The True-Life Story as Told by the Holy Bible,” from Genesis through Revelation. As you talk, thumb through the chapter so he can see the beautiful illustrations. Then explain that among the things that the Bible reliably foretells is “Earth’s Future as a Paradise in God’s Purpose.” Turn to the chapter bearing this title, beginning on page 375, and read from it a brief portion that shows what a marvelous future awaits humankind in the new system of things. You might want to read Bevelatlon 21: 3, 4 as quoted in the last part of paragraph 2 on page 375. You may prefer to read from paragraph 11 on page 379 concerning the changes that will take place in humans themselves. Or yon could use the promise of security in paragraph 12 on that same page., Select an excerpt that you can use effectively and that you feel will do the most to stimulate the interest of the particular householder to whom you are talking. Emphasize the importance of learning what the Bible says and using it as our guide in life, so that we will be among those to receive these marvelous blessings from God in his righteous new system now near at hand. In this way you can effectively present the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">® What is the quickest way to find answers to questions or to solve problems connected with the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “Watch Tower Publications Index&quot; contains many references to subjects and scriptures on which questions arise when we are busy in the ministry. So it would be best to go first to the &quot;Index&quot; and then follow the references to the Society’s publications. In this way answers can be obtained almost immediately on most Scriptural questions or historical points. It is also possible to get information through local libraries when it comes to points of history, geography or some scientific matters. Generally speaking, people like to have answers to their questions as soon possible. So the Society recommends following this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you cannot find the answer by the above-mentioned procedure, wives will do well to seek the help of their husbands, and children can consult their parents. If further help is needed, you may be able to consult the local overseer or some other mature publisher in your congregation and gain assistance. The overseer is glad to offer mature Christian assistance when it is needed. He is acquainted with you personally and he knows the local situation. There are also visits from the circuit servant, and when he is with the congregation he will be pleased to try to help. Sometimes even when problems are submitted to the Society they have to be referred back to the overseer because of proper theocratic procedure in the congregation, and that is another reason why it is good to follow’ the arrangement set out above when a problem arises that you personally need help to solve.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> At the “Word of Truth” district assemblies all of us were encouraged to begin using the new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font14"> right away. We have been doing just that, and the results have been wonderful I What will be happening during November? An earth-wide distribution of the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">What Has Happened So Far?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Shipments of the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font14"> in Spanish and English have reached Europe, Africa and Asia for distribution among Spanish- and English-speaking people on these continents. Australia and New Zealand have received shipments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">A lot of things have happened around Bethel recently. One of the highlights was the graduation of 108 students of the fortieth class of Gilead. We certainly had a big day here on September 13, when they graduated. Brother Knorr told us that the graduates were being sent to forty-three countries. No sooner had we said good-bye to them when more students began to arrive, and now we have 105 pioneers, special pioneers and circuit servants here from fourteen lands to attend the next class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The other day Brother Knorr got all these new students together, and we hear that he talked to them for two and a half hours about the grand privilege before them in the missionary work and explained to them how all you publishers are making it possible for the Society to finance the work so that they can be sent to all parts of the world to preach the good news. On Monday, October 11, school opened, and the students were excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Central and South American countries have a good supply of the book in Spanish. Every congregation in the United States and Canada has received a shipment of the book. Many have already ordered more. We expect that November will prove to be an outstanding month in the distribution of the new book and in helping new ones to begin to learn the truth I</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> It was just three weeks after the “Word of Truth” district assembly when a newly baptized sister was heard bubbling over with appreciation for the new book. When she saw and examined the new book, she was convinced that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“this is just what they need.”</span><span class="font14"> With this conviction she offered the book to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Though they were not going to be assigned to their language classes until the second week of school, we hear that Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, German and French will be taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On Monday night, after school had opened, we enjoyed experiences from some of the students, and we learned that, on the average, they have been in the truth over eleven years and are twenty-seven-and-a-half years old. So they are mature people, and at the same time they have the vigor of youth needed to take on missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Oh, yes, before the school opened, we got a report from Pittsburgh that Brothers Franz and Groh had been reelected as directors of the Society’s Pennsylvania corporation. So the same board of directors continues in charge of the work as last year. Of course, you know that Brother Riemer died. Now Brother John Groh is caring for the work that Brother Riemer did as assistant secretary and treasurer. One of the largest crowds ever at-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font14"> 3, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3) </span><span class="font14">those she knew, and in her enthusiastic witnessing, both incidental and regular, she placed ten copies in the first three weeks after the assembly. Have you found, too, that this new book is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">just what they need?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What’s in it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Many of you have read all or part of the new book by now. Have you considered how helpful it will be to people in your territory? There are many people in this country who do not believe in God. Many others who have been churchgoers for years have seriously come to question God’s existence or his interest in the affairs of man. Chapter One comes right to grips with this problem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> There are many sincere persons who believe that the Bible contains much truth, but often they do not believe that the Bible is all truth, that it is God’s Word. With the existence of many other religious “holy” books the world over, how can they be sure that the Bible is the one book of divine origin that is true in every respect and reliable for their guidance? Anyone coming to an accurate knowledge of the truth must be satisfied on this point. Chapter Two sets forth the facts, clearly and simply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Most people, inside and outside of Christendom, have never read the Bible. Chapter Three interestingly and delightfully presents a synopsis of the Scriptures in “The True-Life Story as Told by the Holy Bible.” After interested ones have been helped to acquire this foundation information, they are in position to consider intelligently the doctrines of the Bible presented thereafter in the new book. It is just what the people in your territory need, isn’t it?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Making Disciples of People. Song 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Brooklyn branch letter. A servant visits inactive couple and uses material in “Kingdom Ministry” branch letter to encourage them. In conclusion he invites them to attend meeting, which invitation is accepted. 17 min: “Offer New Book ‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.’ ” Question-and-answer discussion with audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">14 min: Simplified sermon that can be used with new book offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) Chairman encourages all to get acquainted with simplified sermon to use with new book. On many occasions we find the householder truly busy, on the way out, etc. Also, new publishers, publishers who have difficulty speaking English, and younger publishers can share in the book offer by using simplified sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) Father teaches his son or daughter the following short sermon. ( Depending on circumstances with local congregation, mother could teach her son or daughter.) Tn view of world conditions, many wonder if God has forgotten us. Some even feel we can no longer depend on the promises of God found in the Bible. That we can depend upon God’s promises we are assured here at Hebrews 6:18, which definitely tells us God does not lie when he says something. (Read portion of scripture from page 1 of book or from Bible, make appropriate comments and offer book.)’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Young publisher gives simplified sermon to father, who commends him. Father outlines their Sunday service. He will introduce his son as suggested in April 1965 “Kingdom Ministry” and then son will give simplified sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Father and son at door. Father starts conversation with householder, saying, ‘I am a minister and this is my son who is in training for the ministry. He is obeying Jesus’ command to call on people and talk about God’s kingdom and has prepared a brief Bible sermon. [Name], will you share that interesting thought (or information) with this lady?’ Son gives simplified sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Chairman’s summary. This approach has worked very well. It can he used by parents with their children or older publishers when working with younger ones. Encourage all to use simplified sermon when opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">2 min: Accounts servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Incorporate “How Did We Do in September?” Song 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Aiding Others to Assume Responsibility. Song 77.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Introduction, text and comments, and items from Theocratic News. Family with one or two children discuss text and, thereafter, Theocratic News items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Properly Care for Interested Persons That Move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) (Chairman) Every year many interested persons with whom we conduct Bible studies move out of the congregation’s territory. It is our earnest desire that these sheeplike persons resume their study as soon as possible on getting situated where they move. What can be done by us to see that the interested person will be called on wherever he might move?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Publisher, on concluding home Bible study, is informed by student that husband’s company has notified them of a transfer. They will be moving shortly. Publisher is sorry to learn of this, comments on how much he has enjoyed their Bible study. Student expresses appreciation for the many things learned, will miss the weekly study. Publisher encourages student to contact Jehovah’s witnesses on getting situated. Information often is available in the telephone book, and, ‘Before long one of the Witnesses undoubtedly will call on you. He will be glad to renew the study.’ Student agrees to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) (Chairman) Discussion with one conducting the study. Points out that many who move lose contact with Jehovah's organization; much is involved in moving, getting settled; often the intentions of student are good, but not being mature, he needs help and encouragement to continue study at new location. What can be done? Chairman explains it would be good to ascertain the address student will move to and explain he will be pleased to notify the congregation of student’s moving into the area so competent minister will be able to call and renew study. Publisher expresses appreciation for suggestion, is invited by chairman to demonstrate with student how this can be tactfully done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(4 min.) After publisher encourages student who is moving to continue study, as outlined above, informs student he would be pleased to notify the congregation in the area where student is moving so a competent minister will be able to call and continue study. Ascertains tactfully from student new address, approximate date of arrival, and other pertinent particulars. Informs student that information will be sent to the congregation. Student expresses appreciation for interest and thoughtfulness, and gladly provides information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Chairman explains that student’s name, new address, up-to-date Study Record and any other pertinent information would be sent to overseer of congregation into whose territory the student is moving. If overseer of next congregation is not known, the information can be sent to the Society, which, in turn, will forward it to the proper overseer. If interested person moves where no congregation exists, study can be carried on by mail. (Please see February 1964 “Kingdom Ministry” supplement, paragraph 26, for further details.) A number of publishers have done this. It has resulted in the continuance of the study where student moved, thus aiding him to grow spiritually with a minimum delay after moving. Local or “Yearbook” experiences may be related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: &quot;Are You Reaching Out?” Question-and-answer discussion by overseer or other servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: “Good Reasons for Keeping Clean.” Talk based on article in August 8, 1965, “Awake!” Speaker will especially highlight need for cleanliness when engaged in field ministry and attending meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Concluding comments. Comment on slogan, page 4. Song 74.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Witnessing for the True God. Song 84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">25 min: “Why Continue to Preach?” Question-and-answer coverage of September 15, 1965, “Watchtower” article. One handling the part will make up appropriate questions on each paragraph. Paragraphs will be read in summary as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Will We Make It? Congregation servant discusses with all study conductors on platform prospects for aiding all who desire to serve Jehovah, and who qualify, to share in the service during December. Doing so, we can reasonably expect an increase—a 10-percent increase, it is hoped. In preparation for this part the congregation servant should gather various statistics regarding the potential of the congregation, such as the total required for a 10-percent increase, number of Publisher’s Record cards, number of home Bible studies, irregular and inactive publishers, etc. These represent individuals who have shown a desire to serve Jehovah. Congregation servant presents matter to conductors briefly, arranges for care and attention to be given to all publishers, aiding them to share in December activity. Conductors should be prepared and have actual plans made on what they are going to do in rendering personal, loving assistance to those with their service center. Be brief and to the point so all can offer their thoughts, if many conductors in congregation. Emphasis should be put on what will be done to aid irregular publishers, both during December and in future months. Also, how new ones who qualify can be started in December. Show what will be done in using mature publishers and pioneers to aid others to share in field service. Overseer will make suggestions as to plans in congregation to aid some to vacation pioneer during December. Overseer should brief conductors before this meeting part so an informative, helpful part will result for study conductors and publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Cover appropriate announcements. Song 4&lt;).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Fearless in Preaching God’s Disclosed Secrets. Song 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Talk on monthly theme “Fearless in Preaching God’s Disclosed Secrets.” (See December 1, 1965, “Watchtower.”) Work in material covered in Question Box as part of talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “A Suggestion for Starting Studies.” Talk and demonstration, to be handled possibly by Bible study servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Model demonstration of sermon used during November, adapting it to Bible, book and booklet offer, on a contribution of $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Concluding comments. Include review of suggestions presented previous week for aiding all to share in service in December; encourage publishers to report by the 12th if possible. Song 8.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Reaching Gut?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah's smooth-working organization is indeed a marvel, isn’t it? l»ur as it expands, the need for capable men becomes great. For example, last, year alone, 180 new congregations were formed in the United States. With eight servants’ positions to be filled in each of these congregations, 1,440 appointments of servants were made. Additionally, hundreds of study conductors were added in order that the spiritual needs of our brothers and interested persons might be successfully met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> But where do these additional servants and study conductors come from? From within the congregation, for dedicated brothers have been encouraged to reach out for added privileges of service and many have done so. (1 Tim. 3:1) Hence, those serving in positions of oversight will lovingly want to encourage newer<sub>v</sub> ones, ‘that their advancement may be manifest to all persons.’—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Above all. overseers should be observant and alert to watch for those who can be trained as servants and study conductors. Dedicated brothers should be assigned to work as assistants to each of the servants wherever possible. The appointed servant should diligently train and encourage his assistant and teach</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">♦ At meetings for field service the following suggestions may be used if they suit your territory: November 14, simplified sermon; November 21, how to overcome local objections to place book and booklet offer; November 28, review current sermon: December 5, review suggestion on page 4 for starting Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Congregations are encouraged to plan special witnessing for December 25, using either the Bible-and-book offer or magazines. Additional magazines desired should be ordered by November 15, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Overseer and Bible study servant should meet early in the month to discuss the Bible study servant’s work and especially how the Bible study servant can assist congregation to build Bible studies up to one per publisher. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Literature offer: December, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font12"> with a booklet, on a contribution of $1.50. January through April, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription campaign. Year’s subscription and three booklets $1. Please order booklets and increase magazine supply now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Orders for copies of the 1966 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> and calendar in English may be submitted starting November 23, and those in other languages may be ordered two weeks later. The Yearbook is available in English and Spanish, 50c each. Calendars available in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish, 25c each. Please order through your congregation. Pioneers </span><span class="font14">him all that he possibly can about his work. Commend him for his interest and concern. When the appointed servant goes on vacation or gets sick, the assistant can fill in during the absence, under the direction of the overseer. This arrangement will result in good service for the congregation, and capable men will he prepared to assume responsibility as needed. In reality, it is like having a “second team” all ready to go into action when new congregations are formed or when adjustments are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> But what about study conductors? The same arrangement should be in effect. It is advisable for each study conductor to have a dedicated assistant, wherever possible. The regular conductor cares for the study, meetings for field service, and so forth: and the assistant is trained by his example and by personal discussions with the conductor. However, when the conductor is away giving a talk at another service center or is sick, the assistant can manage things until his return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Overseers and mature brothers should want to do everything within their power to assist in training new ones to grasp these additional privileges and responsibilities, to Jehovah’s praise.—2 Tim. 2 : 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">on the list before July 1, 1965, may receive a free </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> by placing request with literature servant.

Pioneers may obtain additional </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> copies at 15c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Any who can arrange to vacation pioneer in December are encouraged to do so. The enrollment requirements are still the same: One must be a regular publisher for six months and baptized, though not for six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The pioneer rate for “Make </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sure of AU Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine”</span><span class="font12"> is the same as for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon” </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">first things you examined in the new book? Many people today obtain publications that feature pictures. Leaf through Chapter Three in particular: show interested ones the beautiful illustrations. This alone may convince them to take the book. Remember also that pictures can be a great aid to the reader, making a double impression on his mind, and helping him to gain an accurate* impression from what he reads. Use them well. Yes, the new book is just what they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do You Feel Like This?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>s</sup> It was a pleasure to hear from the brothers in tiie Spanish Unit in Pecos, Texas. They said : ‘We give thanks to Jehovah for our tine new book. This week we placed 43 books and obtained watermelons, squash, eggs and fourteen new studies!’ Pioneers and publishers every where have reported that they are having excellent success in starting studies in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Your brothers all over the United States have had good success in using tiie new sermon to present tin* book. Have you? Try it. May Jehovah bless us in our united efforts to make November an outstanding month of praise to him by our wholehearted, worldwide distribution of the new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which ft Is Impossible for God to Lie.<sup>11</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font14">tended that Pittsburgh meeting —1,680! They packed out the building, standing in the back of the hall and sitting on the stairways, to hear the program, in which Brother Knorr thoroughly discussed the year's text for 1966.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The United States branch lias completed its annual report now, and it shows a 3-percent increase in publishers—302,450 out each month. Good increases were made in distribution of magazines, obtaining new subscriptions, making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies, and in public meetings. The overall picture is good, and we are all happy to have had a part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The big thing that is keeping us busy here now is getting ready for November.

<p><span class="font2">A Suggestion for Starting Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> It is not unusual to hear publishers say, “I wish I had a Bible study,” or pioneers say, “I wish I had more Bible studies.” Are you as a publisher conducting at least one Bible study? As a pioneer, seven? As a special pioneer, ten? If not, you may wish to try the following suggestion, which some have found to be effective in starting studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Recently the Society wrote a few pioneers and circuit servants in various parts of the country to try to get studies started by simply stating to the householder that the purpose in calling was to encourage home Bible study and we would be pleased to study with them at no cost or obligation. What were the overall results? Very fine indeed! A pioneer wrote: “The response was excellent! Four Bible studies were started, two of which seem to be outstanding calls.” Another pioneer stated: “The response was marvelous. Six new studies were started. The most outstanding thing to me was that two of these were in an apartment house where there was no interest before. This is my personal territory and 99 percent of the apartment is Catholic. I had been to these families a number of times and they have never taken anything but a handbill. One woman said, ‘You mean you really don’t want to sell anything but just teach</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How is the new book going? Just fine! You will be glad to know that more books were placed in September than for any month in years. Back in June 1952, 333,412 were placed, whereas we report 347,312 for September. Publishers averaged .8; vacation pioneers, 6.7; regular pioneers, 9.7, and special pioneers, 14.7. It is good to see that we are not only placing the book but also starting studies. They increased from 209,278 in August to 218,652 for September. Keep up the fine work, brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">me the Bible?’ When I assured her that was what I wanted to do, she said, ‘I would just love it. Can you come Monday evening at 7:30?’ ” A circuit servant in Arizona wrote: “I started three Bible studies in the first three homes contacted.” A circuit servant in Washington wrote, “In six hours it was possible to start ten studies.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> What was used as an introduction? A very simple approach. After a few comments on the value of God’s Word, this was said: ‘I am interested in helping people to understand the Bible and would be pleased to study it with you or your family in your home at no cost or obligation. Your own Bible will be used, regardless of whether it is Catholic, Protestant, or other. If you do not have a Bible, one will be supplied for a contribution of $1. [A’ew </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation</span><span class="font14"> shown.]* If the householder manifests interest, offer to demonstrate how a free home Bible study would be conducted, using the “Good Veu-s” or the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font14"> booklet. If your invitation to study is declined, give a short sermon and offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font14"> book, or, in December, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font14"> and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">'Impossible to Lie'</span><span class="font14"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> One approach used, which worked well, is: ‘I am making brief calls on persons of different religions. No doubt you have your religion, as do many of your neighbors. Regardless of one's religion, there is something all of us are concerned about, and that is the difficult times and critical conditions under which we live today. My purpose in calling today is to encourage free home Bible study, which is the means of learning clearly what God has in store for us. I would like to demonstrate to you how you can get the most from your Bible. There is no obligation or cost on your part, and it will take only five or ten minutes.’ If the householder is agreeable, the study method is demonstrated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If you are desirous of having a Bible study or increasing the number of Bible studies you are presently conducting, why not try this suggestion? It has worked well for others and may be the means of enabling you to increase your part in the all-important home Bible study activity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">• What should be done when we are witnessing and a superintendent of an apartment, landlord of a building or owner of a trailer court asks us to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In many cases superintendents or managers are merely following the instructions of their employers and are not arbitrary. Nevertheless, if we are asked to leave, we can tactfully and kindly show that our work is of a religious nature of the utmost importance and is a public service. Without being demanding we can appeal to the individual in an endeavor to show the importance of our ministerial activity. If the objection is to working the building on Sunday, it would be good to return on another day. As a token of showing your willingness to cooperate and even leave if necessary, you may wish to put your Bible and literature away in your briefcase at the beginning of your discussion. If, after calmly talking to the person, you are ordered to leave, you should do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although we feel that we have a legal right to witness in these places, it is not wise to insist, under the present state of the law, on such right to the point that arrests occur. If advisable, you or others can return on another occasion and, depending upon circumstances, work only one or a few doors or trailers, then returning again to work a few more; or you can write personal letters giving a witness to those who live there. By your keeping an accurate record, all persons in the building or trailer court will be called on. In connection with trailer courts, a copy of the “Marsh” opinion can be obtained from the Society by the congregation servant and given to the manager or owner.</span></p>

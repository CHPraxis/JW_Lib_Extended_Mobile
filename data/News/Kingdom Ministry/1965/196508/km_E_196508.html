<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QW T’uMislie/is:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">At this season of the year Jehovah’s people are doing a lot of traveling because it is convention time. As we travel we often have the pleasant experience of seeing a Kingdom Hall along the way. Now, with over 5,000 congregations in the United States, there are thousands of Kingdom Halls throughout the land, and they are increasing in number from year to year. In the past, thirty-six months upward of 686 congregations that we know of have embarked on Kingdom Hall projects, either constructing a new Kingdom Hall or purchasing a suitable building and remodeling it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many Kingdom Halls are concreteblock type of construction: some are brick: others, frame and brick. They range in size from a modest seating capacity of approximately 50 on up to 200 or more. The average is about 145. On an average, the Kingdom Halls are evaluated at about $21,000. This represents the generous contributions of the brothers in the congregation as well as their personal labors, because, in the majority of cases, when a Kingdom Hall is built or remodeled the bulk of the labor is provided by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where local officials were prejudiced, it took one congregation more than sixteen years of perseverance and the expenditure of much time and money in order to obtain a permit. Court proceedings were involved. The court decision was favorable, which has aided other congregations in the area, and thus five Kingdom Halls in their circuit are now under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Behind all the efforts of the brothers to get Kingdom Halls, there is the strong desire to assemble together and to have a center for service activities and worship. Jehovah has blessed his servants, and we rejoice that, in the United States, on the average, about twenty new Kingdom Halls are now being started every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Assembling together is very important to all of us. We are happy</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Reasonable Objective</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Oh, no, not </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font11"> territory! We placed hardly any literature the last time we worked there! Don’t we have some other territory we can work instead?” Have you ever responded that way upon learning where you were going to work? We probably all have—at least to ourselves, if not aloud. While it is true that some territories may be more productive than others from the standpoint of literature placements, we certainly do not want to neglect working any of our territories. Just as certain types of soil require different farming methods to produce fruitage, so, too, various situations, if properly handled, can bring forth good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When we find it difficult to place literature we should not feel that our time has been wasted. Really, what is our primary objective? It is to give a Kingdom witness, and the placement of literature is only incidental to this goal. So, if we can talk to people about the Bible we certainly have accomplished something. Are you able to help people learn something they did not to hear from our brothers in Europe that their assemblies are going very well. In Oslo, Norway, 12,332 attended the public meeting. At Helsinki there were 17,08$ in attendance at the public talk. The attendance in Rotterdam was 21,816: 11,710 in Charleroi, Belgium, and 3,835 at Luxembourg. Brothers in many parts of the world are also rejoicing in the same program. If you have not yet attended one of the assemblies near you, we hope that you will be able to arrange to be at one this summer. And on the way you may find opportunity to stop at a Kingdom Hall to enjoy fellowship with the brothers there.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">We are thankful to Jehovah for the large family and for the love that exists among all his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers promoting true worship, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">previously know, or to enhance their appreciation of information they may already have about the Bible and to see how it applies in their lives? If your answer is Yes, then you are doing a very fine work. Quite frequently we find persons who have misunderstandings about Jehovah’s organization. If we can clarify points that may be causing stumbling, fine! Really, then, much good can be accomplished even though literature may not be placed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> But you may say: “In some territories it isn’t possible to give the sermon more than a few times during an entire morning, much less place literature.” This truly does present a challenge. Yet, while some may not appreciate our message, it is good to keep in mind that Jehovah is pleased with what we are doing. Remember, for forty years .Jeremiah’s preaching was rejected, but this did not stop him from doing the assigned work. It may be that some, even though they do not want to hear the sermon, can be helped to have a more friendly attitude toward our work. A reasonable goal then, when meeting persons who are extremely opposed, is to leave them in a better frame of mind. When extreme opposition is encountered, it is good to remember that “an answer, when mild, turns away rage.” (Prov. 15: 1) For example, a sister recently met a woman who was extremely rude. The publisher gave a kind answer and continued calling on other persons in the same apartment building. About fifteen minutes later the woman who had been unkind came to her and said : &quot;Pardon me. I want to apologize for being so rude.” She explained that salesmen were constantly calling and this had gotten on her nerves. The kindness shown by this sister paved the way for a Kingdom witness to be given. It is always good to be friendly and to show empathy. Give the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Unified Praise to the Only True God. Song 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Introduction, text and comments. Include consideration of material in branch letter. Two sisters could be shown discussing letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Praise Jehovah in Song. A short talk, based on article in June 1, 1965, “Watchtower,” can be given on the part singing plays in our worship. Joy and benefit received from active participation. Emphasize (1) the value of concentrating on the thoughts expressed and (2) singing wholeheartedly. Song 9 can be analyzed verse by verse; ask audience to point out fine thoughts in each verse. The audience can sing each verse after it is analyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “A Reasonable Objective.” It would be good to stress the need of not being too persistent but, rather, having a proper balance. Include the reading of the experience in the July 22, 1964, “Awake!” on page 15, “Tactfulness Bears Fruit.” Local experiences can also be worked into the part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments (including accounts report and “How Did We Do in June?”). Song 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Willing and Effective Kingdom Service. Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Introduction, text and comments. Family group can be shown considering text and talking about Theocratic News items. To make it lively and interesting, the children could be finding places mentioned on a map. Compare figures with those in the latest “Yearbook” to give them more meaning. Draw out comments from children to show that these figures represent people who show they want to serve Jehovah and live through Armageddon with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: “Be Willing to Serve with What You Have.” (Talk based on material in July 1, 1965, “Watchtower.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Meetings for Field Service. (Demonstration and discussion) Chairman can comment briefly on benefit of practical instruction at meetings for field service. Study conductors can particularly be encouraged to comment on the following. Suggested points for these meetings, listed under Announcements in “Kingdom Ministry,” can be worked into schedule by each study conductor as appropriate. The one handling meetings for service should take the initiative. If many publishers are going to be making back-calls, then the conductor may want to discuss the back-call activity. The conductor should be alert to check and see if back-calls are being made. If the weather is bad, it may be best to work inside territory or to do back-call work. Certain holidays may make it advisable to change the sermon slightly or to use a different sermon. Current events can be worked into the presentation and some time could be used to discuss or demonstrate how this can be done. If some calls on inactive persons are going to be made before or after the regular field ministry, “Yearbook” experiences such as the one found on page 238 could be mentioned (also see pp. 65, 77-78, 125, 243-244). If new publishers are going out in service for the first time, the conductor may want to discuss the simplified sermon. Good local experiences from time to time might incite others to start studies. Since text is to be discussed and other helpful points considered within the 15 minutes allotted, things will need to be well planned and instruction given pointed so that all will get into the field service on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Presenting the Good News. (Q uest ion-an d-an swer coverage) Points in paragraphs three and four may be demonstrated. Local experiences may also be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Concluding comments. Include material in Question Box and appropriate items under Announcements. Song 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Working with a Purpose. Song 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “They Need Your Attention.” (Audience participation) Read paragraphs if desired. After completion of last paragraph you might have publisher raise hand, stating she would like to work in one of those territories not worked often. Servant invites her up to platform. They discuss which territories need working. Sister picks one she would like to work and is invited to come to territory counter after meeting to obtain it. (Magazine-territory servant is encouraged to have list prepared and on display near master map before the service meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: “Your Attitude Counts.” (Discussion and demonstration) Chairman can draw comments from audience, stressing need for discernment, empathy and consideration in answering objections. If one says he is busy, try to ascertain what he means. Is he on his way out this very minute? Does he mean he doesn't have all morning? Is he doing something urgent at the moment but would be free a short time later? Or is he too busy simply because he is not interested? At times sincerely acknowledging the objection and leaving a friendly impression without giving the regular sermon may be the best course. Or responding with a question as to what other time would be convenient, either that same day or another day, might be advisable. Being discerning will enable us to avoid giving the impression that w’e are too persistent. If we discern that the person is just being evasive we may feel it advisable to try to overcome the objection. Possibly by acknowledging it and suggesting that we will take only a few minutes and then keeping our word we will be given a chance to give a brief witness. Audience can be asked to give suggestions on how they have been able to handle the objection, “I’m busy.” If time allows and there is another objection very common to your territory, this too can be discussed, and demonstrated by publisher prepared in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Consideration of an aspect of the congregation’s activity that needs attention and what each publisher can do for improvement. The main point mentioned on the latest circuit servant’s report can be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Include article “It Costs $1,200 a Month.” Song 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Boldly Speaking God’s Word with His Spirit. Song 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on “Boldly Speaking God’s Word with His Spirit.” (See September 1, 1965, “Watchtower.”) 25 min: Effective Back-Calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(5 min.) A talk encouraging publishers to be sure that their service schedule allows a sufficient part of their service time to make back-calls on all interested ones located; after all, they are the ones we are looking for. Make calls promptly. Suggest that about half of one’s service time may be spent in back-call and Bible study activity. Back-calls may be made and studies conducted anytime: weekdays, evenings, Saturday or Sunday. Give productive Bible studies priority on service schedule, arranging other service activity around them when that is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(17 min.) Use this time on the service meeting to help publishers in audience to prepare for back-calls on their lists. Ask them to select actual calls from their House-to-House Record, relate what they have noted there and then ask for suggestions on how to handle these situations. In each case invite other publishers in the audience to offer suggestions. Endeavor to cover a variety of circumstances. (Encourage publishers ahead of time to be sure that they have their records with them. Talk to some personally and ask them to select calls on which they would like help, but include others who raise their hands.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During discussion emphasize these points: (1) Be prepared. Have in mind something definite to say when householder comes to the door, and definite Scriptural material to consider with him. Be ready to start a study. (2) Do not try to cover too much information on one call. Review what is learned; it helps householder to appreciate the benefit of the discussion. (3) Encourage householder to use his own Bible; it makes greater impression on him. If he does not know how to find texts, explain what the numbers mean and how to use the index in the front of his Bible. Rather than looking up the scriptures for him, help him to learn how. (4) In many cases it is helpful in making return visits if the publisher asks the householder when he would find him at home. Or if you call when householder is too busy to listen, ask when it would be convenient. If, after a couple of calls, you do not find certain ones at home, try a different, time—earlier or later in the day, or another day of the week. (5) If some who seem to be teachable are always busy (Matt. 13:22), try having a brief one-scripture presentation ready; use a different text each time you call. Gradually you may build up the interest. (6) If some who at first, showed interest seem cool when you return, it may be that family or friends ridiculed. (Matt. 13:20, 21) Try to be understanding, patient; endeavor to strengthen their faith. (7) Do not become discouraged. Dividing work taking place. Your perseverance and kindness, even in the face of rebuffs, will attract sincere ones to true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(3 min.) Review’ with the congregation the seven points set out here. Ask the publishers to state them, one at a time, and then to offer additional brief comments to emphasize their value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Demonstration on how to present the current offer. Experiences already had in presenting the offer can be entertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Concluding comments. Song 69.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">They Need Your Attention</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> If you had a choice between working in a territory that was recently worked or in one not worked recently, which would you pick? Well, the truth of the matter is, as many of us know, that the results are usually the best and the increase the greatest in territory that is worked more often. Nevertheless, there are sheep like individuals in the territories that have not been worked so often and these need our attention too. Do you know which territories in your congregation have not been worked recently? Maybe not, but the magazineterritory servant does. He keeps a record of when each territory was last worked and whether it was worked with the regular sermon or with magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Would you magazine-territory servants like to make a list for the congregation of all territories that have not been worked recently? List the territory number, the date it was last worked and with what it was worked. Then post the list</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>I* Costs $1,200 a Month</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">You’re right, that’s a lot of money. But this is what it costs the Society each month when the Post Office returns undeliverable magazines to us. About half of this results from people moving and not notifying us of their new address. True, the subscriber may notify the Post Office of the change, but their system is to return the magazines, with the new address marked on the wrapper, and charge the Society ten cents for each one returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What can we do to help?” you ask. We suggest the following: (1) If you are going to move and you have your new address, obtain a Change of Address slip from your overseer, fill it out, and send it in to the Society along with the address cut from the wrapper of the latest magazine you received. (2) Be sure you get an accurate address on each new subscription you obtain. Carefully check the house number, street name and city, ns well as zip code. Accounts servants can assist by carefully checking each subscription slip turned in. (3) If you know that an interested person is moving, help him fill out a Change of Address slip and send it in to the Society as described above. (4) In addition to this, notify the Post Office of your change of address. Saving any part of that $1,200 a month by following the above suggestions would be a real help. Don’t you agree?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">near the master map in the Kingdom Hall so all can see which territories need to be worked. The brothers will appreciate your doing this.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Then, brothers, you can see which territories have not been worked recently and you may ask for the one you wish. Some of you sisters may wish to take out a territory to work during the week. You study conductors may find that you can work with your groups in one of these territories on weekends or at other convenient times. Family groups or pioneers may wish to work some of these territories. And as we search in these territories. brothers, what an<sup>1</sup> we after? We are looking for sheeplike ones who desire to learn the truth, aren’t we? As you endeavor to cover each of the territories in your congregation we pray that Jehovah will bless you with good success and many happy experiences in finding and feeding the sheeplike ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Announcements</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">At meetings for service during August we suggest that you consider how to conclude house-to-house calls on a friendly note when (1) person is too busy, (2) person is not interested, (3) literature offer is refused, and (4) person does not want to talk. It would be most effective to consider only one of these each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Actual count of literature inventory should be taken in September. Two literature inventory forms are being sent to each congregation with the monthly statement. The original should be filled out and returned to the Society no later than September 5. Retain the duplicate for the congregation file. Congregations are being sent a new chart and a supply of congregation monthly report cards and magazine distributors order blanks. No chart instructions are being sent, as these should be in your file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Literature offer for October is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> subscription and three booklets for $1.

How many additional copies will you need?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregations may want to arrange for magazine activity on Labor Day, September 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt;$► Congregation accounts should be audited on September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">O Time left to make arrangements to attend an assembly this summer is limited. If you have not yet done so, we encourage you to write now for rooming accommodations in one of the remaining assembly cities. The New York assembly, the last one of the series, will have two extra days, making it a six-day assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ If you have not already done so, you might want to provide your doctor with a copy of the July 22 and August 8 issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> They contain fine articles on blood transfusion.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">• May anyone who raises his hand in a congregation meeting be called on to comment, whether he qualifies to be a Witness or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When individuals associate with Jehovah’s organization and show a desire to learn, we generally encourage them to participate in the meetings. It is true that some who accept an invitation to attend our meetings may still be well known as church members, or they may belong to a military organization. Some may be morally upright; others may be dishonest or they may be living in adultery. We do not inquire into their private lives before inviting them to the meetings. As long as they show a sincere desire to learn God's Word, they are welcome. And if, on observing how the meeting is conducted, some of these newcomers raise their hand to offer a comment, the conductor, using his own good judgment, may call on them just as he would call on anyone else. Their commenting in the meeting does not mean that they are being recognized as part of the congregation; it is simply part of our arrangement to help them to learn the truth. As they grow in accurate knowledge they will begin to see for themselves what changes they must make in order to please Jehovah.—Col. 3:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, persons who at one time were Jehovah’s witnesses but are n'ow disfellowshiped or who have disassociated themselves by deliberately choosing a course in violation of Christian neutrality would not be invited to comment, in harmony with what is written at 2 John 8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, if anyone who is called on to comment gives an unscriptural answer, the conductor should tactfully see that the right thought is presented, either explaining it himself or calling on someone else to comment. Should it be that a newcomer endeavors to pursue the discussion further, the conductor can kindly explain that we have a limited time to cover the lesson but that he will be glad to talk to him personally after the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So we welcome those who are interested in God’s Word. Their comments help them to fix Bible truths in their mind and they are stimulating to others too.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It certainly is fine to see that so many home Bible studies were conducted during the month of June. Congregation publishers were able to average .6, while pioneers averaged 4.9 and special pioneers averaged 7.5 studies. In all, 225,998 studies were conducted with interested persons during the month. Of course, many of these studies had more than one person in attendance, which means that well over a quarter of a million persons were studied with during June. The fine information they received along with the loving assistance rendered will enable these honest-hearted persons to make progress to maturity so that they too will be able to join in the great shout of praise now’ being given, to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">With Versatility</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Is everyone listening to your house-to-house sermon? No? Why not? Well, it could be that some are just not interested in the particular subject that you are using. It’s not easy to get people to talk about something they are not interested in, is it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What can you do about it? Well, what do you do when a friend is over for a visit, but shows no interest in the conversation and just sits there in silence? Why, you change the subject, of course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Of course, in house-to-house work we usually do not know what the householder is interested in. We can’t read his mind, can we? No, but if we do a little tactful probing we just might hit on something that he is interested in. Then, before we know it we may be absorbed in an animated conversation, with a good witness being given. Be alert to this possibility. Try it. Use versatility in dealing with people in the ministry and change subjects when appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> For instance, if a householder says, “I’m really not interested; you people call so often,” you might close your Bible, to indicate that</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Attitude Counts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you found in handling objections that your attitude toward a person is often as important as what you say? Recently a brother called on a man who was not very receptive. He said he was busy doing spring cleaning. The publisher discerned from the beads of sweat on the man’s face that he was indeed busy. So he acknowledged this, saying he would be glad to call another time, and extended an invitation to the public talk. He then kindly suggested to the man that he be careful not to overdo himself. This bit of sympathetic understanding kindled an immediate spark of friendliness that led to a brief general conversation and the placing of two magazines. Using discernment and showing empathy by acknowledging this sincere objection without steamrolling over it brought fine results and prepared the way for a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> At another home the publisher you are not going to be persistent, and, with a friendly smile, say: “You probably wonder why we continue to call, especially when some people are not interested and tell us so.” If a spark of interest is generated—and this approach has often accomplished just that—and you are able to continue, you might say: “It is because of the urgency of our times and out of love for honest-hearted persons. 1 would feel accountable to God if I would pass your door. He has commanded that this good news of the Kingdom be preached so that everyone has an opportunity to hear. Notice how this point is made in Matthew 24: 14.” Thereafter, you may be able to continue your sermon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We encourage you to give this matter some thought and a little advance preparation. Think how rewarding it will be to have some listen who might otherwise not have done so. Then, too, our witnessing will be much more interesting to us personally. So, if the subject of your sermon does not interest the householder, why not change it? As you present the good news be aware of the wisdom of using versatility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">met a woman who looked out from an upper window. She said she could not talk now. He suggested he could call later, in an hour or so. She replied that she might be going out that morning and was not sure she would be in. Sensing that she did not want to consent to a discussion, he left a handbill without persisting in trying to give a verbal witness, realizing that if he left her in a good frame of mind someone else on a later call might find her more receptive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> These common experiences show that our attitude is an important factor in winning over householders or leaving a favorable impression, which may open up the opportunity for a future witness to be given. By giving the householder the benefit of the doubt and putting ourself into his shoes, so to speak, we will know how to give “an answer to each one” as we present the good news.—Col. 4 : 6.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font1">A Reasonable Objective </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(ConVd) </span><span class="font11">householder the benefit of the doubt. Even if you do not have an opportunity to say very much, if you are able to leave the individual in a better frame of mind, that truly is a fine accomplishment. This will provide a good foundation to build on at a later time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Keeping a balanced view and setting a reasonable goal will help us to deal with various situations successfully and to be a real blessing to people we meet in the field ministry. At times we may encounter difficult situations that require great patience. Discernment will aid us to know what kind of people we are working with and the best approach to take. We cannot expect all persons to respond to the Kingdom message. Remember that ours is a separating work and the goal is not world conversion. Most persons will continue to reject the Kingdom message, but sheeplike ones will listen and say it is the truth. By keeping our objective clearly in focus and relying on Jehovah for the needed strength we will rejoice in our ministerial assignment as did Jesus.—Ps. 40: 8.</span></p>

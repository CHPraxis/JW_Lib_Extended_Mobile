<p><span class="font13">Summer is here and the clays are longer now. But it is a good thing that, they are, because we seem to have so much more to do. 'We have been very busy preparing for the conventions, and some of them have already been held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The first group of travelers to the European assemblies went through here on June 5, and two days later Brother Franz left for Glasgow, Scotland, and Brother Knorr flew to London. This year a number of the older members of the Bethel family are arranging to go to some of the assemblies in Europe. It will be a treat for the rest of us to hear their reports when they get back home again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Already the assemblies in Dublin and Edinburgh are completed. By cable from Brother Knorr we learned that there were 65 baptized in Dublin and they had a wonderful public meeting, with 3,948 in attendance. In Edinburgh the assembly was larger, and he reported that there were 576 baptized and 31,501 on hand for the public talk. We are anxious to get more details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are still very excited here about the fine report for April. And you know how it is when you have made a fine record in one month— you wonder what the next month will be like. Well, all the reports for May are in now, and it is a pleasure to note that 308,335 publishers shared in this grand work of declaring the good news of the Kingdom. It must be that almost all the copies of “Arf </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True” </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font13">were distributed in the course of the month too, because our supplies here are exhausted and orders keep coming in for other books that are still available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One thing that helps to keep sharp our appreciation for the service is our daily discussion of the text and comments from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font13"> Here at Bethel it is one of the highlights of our day’s activity. It is stimulating to hear the comments of the members of the family. Some comment on its practical ap-</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">What Does It Take?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> There was an interesting discussion among a group of brothers here, at Bethel a number of weeks ago. One of the brothers asked: “What is it that has aided certain congregations to grow and mature in such a fine way?” All of them knew, of course, that growth comes as a result of Jehovah’s blessing; it is Jehovah who gives the increase, and we thank Jehovah for the growth we enjoy. As the brothers talked, however, Romans 15: 1 came into the conversation. That’s the verse that encourages the strong to help the ones who are not so strong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> “Just to illustrate how practical the counsel in that scripture is,” one of the brothers said, “There is a congregation in southern Ohio where a brother and his wife recently went to serve. A year ago there were seventeen publishers in the congregation; nine were irregular in the service. As the couple got acquainted with the publishers, both went out of their way to give assistance, making appointments with the brothers to share with them in the field, get them to meetings, and so forth. Now there are nineteen publishers in this congregation, but sixteen are regular publishers instead of eight, and only plication to daily life; others draw attention to prophetic significance or to the relationship of the text to other portions of the Bible. From fifteen to twenty minutes are devoted to that morning discussion, and we find that it is time well spent. Then, as we join in prayer together, we ask that Jehovah will bless, not only those of us here, but. all of you, because we feel very close to you as members of the one family of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Just the other day we were particularly thinking about those of you who will be coming to the convention in Yankee Stadium from August 24 to 29. All together, there were 8,484 of us from New York three are irregular publishers, one being a new publisher. And the prospects for growth are excellent. Why, there were forty-four in attendance at the circuit servant’s public talk.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> One of the group responded, “Why, that was just a matter of rendering personal assistance.” And that is right. As the brother stated: “It was personal assistance rendered in a patient, regular and loving way that was of such help in this congregation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> “Talking about helping one another—” one of the brothers said, “in one of the units here in the east a few years ago the Bible study servant had good success. He found it quite easy to start studies. On the other hand, many of the publishers in the congregation felt that they couldn't. You see, many were foreign-speaking and had a great deal of difficulty with the English language. Nevertheless, when the brother got a study started he would invite one of the brothers or sisters to go along with him to get acquainted with the householder. He helped the publisher to participate in the study, having a fuller share each week. Then when the Bible study servant was not able to be</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 2, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font13"> 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">and vicinity that met at the Stadium for the “kickoff” meeting to start the rooming work. There were talks and lively demonstrations that made all of us determined to find the best rooms possible for you and enough so that no one would hold back from coming because of concern that he might not have a place to stay. Similar preparations are being made at all the assembly cities. How good our God is to us in making provision for these “Word of Truth” District Assemblies! It is a joy for us to be working with you as His faithful and loyal servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Let’s Help One Another. Song 1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Branch Letter. If desired, this can be read 'over the phone’ as a news item to a publisher who missed the meeting. Appropriate announcements and a few items from Theocratic News could be included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 min: Questions and answers on article “What Does It Take?” (It is suggested that the last two paragraphs be read, and others if time permits.) 15 min: Presenting the Book Offer in a Way Appropriate in Your Territory. The offer for the month is any bound book that you have on hand, along with a booklet. The brother handling this portion of the meeting could use some of the servants, pioneers (if available), or other mature publishers to make a presentation of the book offer in the same way they do in the house-to-house work. This can be a presentation of the book only, assuming that the sermon has been given. After each presentation the audience can be asked what points in the presentation they felt were effective. Then the individual who made the presentation can he asked why he made the presentation the way he did. This will give him an opportunity to draw attention to the points or paragraphs he used in his presentation and why he chose to use these. You may wish to handle three or four presentations in this way so a variety of ideas are presented. If there is time, field experiences in offering the books can be related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Concluding comments. Include account's report, How Did We Do in May? and Question Box. Song 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: “Jehovah Is Great and Very Much to Be Praised.’’ Song 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Jehovah Is Great and Very Much to Be Praised.” (Ps. 96:4) This is one of the compelling reasons why we serve him. The brother handling this part may present it as a talk. The basis for his material will be the information in the article entitled “This Is Our God” in the April 15, 1965, issue of “The Watchtower.” After considering each of the subpoints in the article, the speaker should draw the conclusion that these are some of the reasons why we love Jehovah and why we delight to serve him. Thus the motive for our service will be emphasized several times during the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Help . Them to Return.” Questions and answers. Paragraphs may be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Directing Interested Ones to the Assemblies. Following your Bible study each week it is most appropriate to take a few minutes to direct the attention of interested ones to Jehovah’s organization and its activities, so that they may become acquainted with the organization and grow in a desire to associate with it. A qualified brother or sister can be used to demonstrate how to present information concerning assemblies and the value of attending. Tell about the district assemblies this summer and your plans to attend. If you have already attended, tell what happened, what you learned, etc., stressing the spiritual benefits received and other blessings. Convention reports from past years and pictures, newspaper clippings, “Yearbook” or “Watchtower” and “Awake!” reports can be used in this discussion. Interested ones can be invited to attend the coming district assembly. If this is past, they can be invited to attend future circuit assemblies and congregation meetings to enjoy spiritual blessings with Jehovah’s organization. 10 min: Concluding comments. Song 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Loyally Serving to Jehovah’s Honor. Song 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17 min: “A People for Jehovah’s Name.” It is suggested that the brother handling this part invite all to open their Bibles and follow along as he reads aloud Isaiah 43:5-12. Thereafter his talk can be based on this material. He can comment briefly on ancient fulfillment of the prophecy and emphasize particularly modern fulfillment and the part the local congregation has in serving as a people for Jehovah’s name. (See “Babylon” book, pages 207-210, 417. 464-467, 549; also “Watch Tower Publications Index” under Isaiah 43:5-12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Upbuilding Experiences from Your Territory, Vacation or Convention. Arrange locally. If additional experiences are needed, these can be taken from the “Yearbook,” “The Watchtower,” etc., dealing with features of service that the congregation is trying to improve. For example, see “Watch Tower Publications Index” under “Back-Calls,” “Magazine Distribution,” etc., for additional experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: Concluding comments. Include “Answers to Your Questions.” Song 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This can be prepared by the congregation overseer. Consideration can be given to the needs of the congregation as well as good counsel given by the circuit servant during his latest visit, the Society’s letter to the congregation following the visit, or a review of the district assembly, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Maintaining Unity in Faith and Work. Song 65.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: “Maintaining Unity in Faith and Work.” Discussion between two publishers who emphasize how this service theme fits their activity for the month. (Refer to “Watchtower” issues of July 1, 1964, and August 1, 1965, for ideas.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Contemplate Their Conduct, Imitate Their Faith.” Questions and answers. Key paragraphs can be read if time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Give Encouragement to One Another.” It would be appropriate for this talk to be given by the overseer, based on “The Watchtower” of March 1, 1965, pages 131 and 132, and “The Watchtower” of July 15, 1963. Tn conclusion he should take a few minutes to give warm commendation to all in the congregation for the good work being done. Specific reference should be made to some of the fine activity being carried on by the brothers locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. Song 67.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What Does It Take? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">at the study one week, he asked his companion to handle it. He helped him to prepare for the study and things went really well. As the publisher gained confidence and grew in ability to conduct the study, the Bible study servant .just let him keep conducting it. The Bible study work grew excellently. To start with, the Bible study average was .2 in the congregation and, if I remember correctly, within a year’s time the average was up to .8 or .9.” Personal assistance surely helped there, didn’t it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> ‘‘But what can you do about low meeting attendance?” one of the group asked. An overseer spoke up and said : “This was a problem in our congregation a few months ago; so we asked our study conductors to bring up questions on Tuesday evening that would be answered at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study on Sunday. They did this during their concluding announcements. Then we asked them to make calls on those who were not attending meetings and tell them a little bit about the coming meeting and invite them to come. The brothers did well in picking up these individuals or walking with them to the Kingdom Hall and sitting with them during the meetings; and our attendance at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study increased from 61 percent to 84 percent in six months.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Another one of the group said : “You know, all this reminds me of the article entitled ‘On the Way to Life’ in the June issue of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> which encouraged us to continue studying with newly baptized publishers who have not completed the publications dealing with basic doctrines. The statement was made that ‘our first concern is to render necessary assistance to help others on the way to life.’ ” It was interesting to observe that these brothers found it was personal assistance, helping one another, that was of such great aid in each of these congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Well, one of the group decided that the next morning he was going to ask one of the brothers in the Society's Service Department what he had observed it was that gen-</span></p></li></ul>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Contemplate Thesr Conduct, Imitate Their Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How often in recent months have you stopped for a moment to observe tlie mature, older brothers and sisters and spend a little time with them? It would be a tine thing for all of us to do, wouldn’t it? Their fine example of godly devotion and sticking tn Jehovah’s organization through the good years and difficult times has aided all of us. It is true, isn’t it? that “gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.”—Prov. 16: 31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As we view Jehovah’s organization as a whole we are reminded that the faithful and discreet slave class is made up of older brothers. For many years these faithful servants of Jehovah have set a wonderful example of zeal and godly devotion. An abundance of spiritual food has been provided at the proper time. All of us have benefited from their service. We are stimulated when we contemplate their conduct and we are encouraged to imitate their faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As we turn our attention to our own congregations we observe those who have served Jehovah so willingly over a long period of time</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Below are suggestions of subjects you may wish to consider in conducting your Sunday morning meetings for field service in July: (1) How current news items can be used to catch a hearing ear in our ministry. (2) How to present the book offer. (See “Second Meeting” on page two for ideas.) (3) Use of House-to-House Record. (See page 4 for ideas.) (4) “Are you prepared to spend some of your time in back-call work this morning?” (Arrange to assist all to do so if possible.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Overseers will want to order regular pioneer supplies for the 1966 service year. Please include with regular literature order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ It is recommended that during July, August and September the congregation cover territory that was not covered often during the winter months, offering any book that you have in stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Congregations may want to make special arrangements for witness work on July 5, since it will be a holiday for most persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Can you vacation pioneer in August? We will be pleased to receive your application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Starting in September, circuit servants will give the public talk “What to Do to Gain Lasting Life in Happiness,” and at circuit assemblies district servants will deliver the public talk “What Does the Resurrection of the Dead Mean for You and Yours?”</span></p>

The share they have in the ministry now may be a large one or it may be a small one due to physical infirmities, but it is apparent that these older brothers and sisters love to serve Jehovah and delight to speak the truth to others. It is also heartwarming to be with them al congregation meetings, to hear their mature comments and to observe the words of encouragement and kindness they have for their brothers and sisters. Yes, there are so many things about our older fellow servants that make us happy to know them and have them in our midst.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As you contemplate these things, ask yourself: When was the last time I expressed a word of commendation to these faithful older servants of Jehovah? When was the last time I took a few moments to engage in conversation with one of these? You can be sure that such an interchange of encouragement will be strengthening to your faith and to theirs. It may be also that you are in a position to help</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When you need a Scriptural answer to a question, how do you go about getting it? Do you ask someone for the information, or do you go right to your own theocratic library and find it? In most cases the answer is right there in your library, and it is easy to find if you use the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps it is a scripture that you would like to have explained. Rather than just passing it by, why not look in the Scripture Index and find out what has been said about it in the Society’s publications? There is a wealth of information, and in most cases it takes only a minute or two to locate it if you have the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span><span class="font13"> But do you have the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font13"> in your personal library?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">UNITED STATES GOAL FOR 1965 321,550 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An average of 10.2 hours in the ministry during May is a fine report. Our average hours for the year now stand at 9.9. Will we be able to average 10 hours per publisher for the service year? We all certainly hope so and will want to continue working toward this goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now add to the activity of the publishers an average of 94.3 hours for the regular pioneers and 141.8 hours for the special pioneers and it comes to 4,213,228 hours spent in Jehovah’s service during the month of May alone. What a wonderful shout of praise went up to Jehovah! Think of now many heard the truth or were aided to get started in the service during this month. Doesn’t it make you glad that you had a share in Jehovah’s service during May?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Did You Write It Down?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “I thought I did. But where is my record? Maybe I did forget. Oh—which house was it? And that was such a good call.” Does this sound like you? If you have ever had this experience, you know the importance of writing it down.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Writing what down? Well, the name and address were needed in this case. Also, why not write down the subject you talked about and the literature you placed? Did the householder give information concerning his interests, his religious affiliation and when you could call again? It may be that you decided what you wanted to talk about on the next call. While these things are fresh in mind is the time to write them down. Many of you do this and know how helpful this information is.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> But what if no one is home? Well, it would be good to write</span></p>
<div>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> There are tens of thousands of persons who at one time associated with Jehovah's organization, attending meetings and sharing in the field service, but, like the prodigal son spoken of by Jesus, they have left the house of their Father and become involved with the interests of the world. Are there some of these living in the territory assigned to your congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How long has it been since their card was removed from the file of active publishers of the Kingdom? Has it been a year? five years? ten years? even longer? It may be that they can be helped. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Well, in the August 1 and August 15 issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">are heart-searching and encouraging articles concerning the parable of the prodigal son, entitled “Recovery Still Possible,” “A Young Man Goes Astray.” “Jehovah, a God of Love and Patience” and “Turning to Jehovah.” If those who were once associated with Jehovah's people could be encouraged to read these articles, it might stir in them a longing to be back in the house of our Father.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> So we suggest that the congregation servant arrange to get copies it down. We want to bring the Kingdom message to each one in our territory. Many congregations that have limited territory find that their carefully recording not-at-homes and calling back on these at another time has in effect given them ‘more territory* to work. You can keep your not-at-homes on a separate record if you like.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> You may find it advantageous to keep a record of your magazine placements, too. Perhaps you can start a route. Some publishers have reported that their best studies were started with individuals who obtained single copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Do you have House-to-House Record forms in your witnessing case now? If not, pick up a few when you are at the Kingdom Hall. Then in the service be sure to write it down. Your House-to-House Record will aid you as you present the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">of these issues to all these persons. No doubt he knows where they live, and if other publishers know of some, it would be a fine thing to mention them to the overseer. Then he can arrange to call on them personally, endeavoring to encourage them to read these fine articles in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and leaving copies with them; and, if necessary, he may ask other mature ones to help in this work. If there are some who cannot be contacted personally, then a brief but very pleasant letter should be written to them and signed by the congregation servant or someone else who knows the person well. One magazine might be sent one week, and the other two weeks later.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It would be a good thing to check now to see how many of these calls need to be made, and then, if you will need more copies of these magazines to care for them, be sure to order the additional ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Wouldn’t it be fine if, as a result of this effort on our part, it could be said of some of these persons: “This your brother was dead but has become alive, and he was lost but has been found”? Let’s do what we can to make that possible.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font11">• When I am away from home, how can I locate a Kingdom Hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even when we are away from home we all enjoy attending the meetings. We don’t want to miss the study material for the week, and it is always a pleasure to get to know our brothers and sisters in the places where we may visit. The Society is glad to aid you to locate the Kingdom Hall in the locality where you plan to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Simply write to us in advance, informing us where you will be, and we will be pleased to provide the address of the Kingdom Hall and the times of meetings. If your trip is planned rather suddenly and you do not have time to request this information from the Society, you may find it helpful to check in the local telephone book under &quot;Jehovah’s Witnesses&quot; or “Kingdom Hall.&quot; It may also be that the local police can tell you where the Kingdom Hall is located, and you will generally find the times of meetings posted out in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It will be refreshing to you and the brothers where you visit to meet together and to share together in the field service.</span></p>

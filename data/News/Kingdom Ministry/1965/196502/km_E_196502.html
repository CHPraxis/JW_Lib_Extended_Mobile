<p><span class="font14">Some of the most distant territory assigned to the United States branch is around Guam and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. There is still a lot of work to be done in that part of the field, and that is one reason why Brother Knorr lias just visited Guam, where a convention was held on the weekend of December 5 and 6. Eighty-two brothers and interested persons attended the Saturday meeting and there were 131 at the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Missionary work has started in Saipan, and there are some brothers serving where the need is great in the Marshall Islands. But there are still many other islands that need attention, so Brother Knorr spoke to the missionaries and the brothers who have recently gone out from the Hawaiian Islands to serve in the area, and it is hoped that we will be able to expand the witness work into other island groups, such as Majuro, Truk and Ponape, in the next few months, and then, as soon as other workers are available, we hope to get a witness given in other islands in the Pacific territory. In some of these islands the people have never heard the Kingdom message. Of course, there is still much room for service, and any brothers who find employment in the Trust Territory islands always have an enjoyable time serving where the need is great. If any of you want to look into the possibilities of going out to serve where the need is great in the Pacific Islands, we think that would be just fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We hope, too, that we may be able to get more help from the some 2,000 publishers in the Hawaiian Islands. Brother Knorr had a fine assembly with the Hawaiian brothers, 1,682 attending the public meeting at Hilo. He has also written to us about having a surprising crowd of 7,463 at a Wednesday night meeting at a Manila racetrack in the Philippines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Here in the United States we are</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Do Not Hold Back!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it,” says Proverbs 3: 27. When considering how much you personally benefit from </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> you have probably thought, “I certainly don’t want to hold back these good things from others. I wish I could really help more persons to appreciate </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">just as I do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> How might we do this? Well, what is it about </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch tower </span><span class="font14">that we like so much? It is the information itself in the various articles, isn’t it? Then why not select a few outstanding points from an article and present these in a brief, interesting way? Or select certain sentences to read, and allow the householder to read right along with you? Our desire is to convince the listener that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> is different from ordinary church journals so that he will want to subscribe for it, and one of the best ways to do this is to read some of it* to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Take, for example, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> of February 15. After para-able to measure our progress in many ways. Often we hear expressions like: “What a spiritual feast we had for three days! What would we do without circuit assemblies?” When we look back to 1947, when the circuit assemblies began in the United States, we had only six districts. Until 1953 the district servant spent only one week with a circuit, serving a circuit assembly. However, a second week was then added, giving the district servant some time to work with the circuit servant at a congregation. Then we had to increase the number of districts, doubling the number to 12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Twelve years after we began to have circuit assemblies our districts had more than tripled. There were 19 districts in 1959. By 1961 the growth was so great that we had formed six new districts in that phrasing the last scripture of our sermon (Matt. 6:10), we migjit read and comment on the caption text from the main article (Rev. 20:13, 14). Then, depending upon the interest shown, we could read the first few lines of the main article. How clear and reassuring these statements are! If advisable, we could even go farther, dropping down to paragraph two, which identifies Satan as the one having the means to cause death and explains how he will be brought to nothing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Of course, in addition to using specific examples, as just mentioned, we should be prepared to describe the purpose and contents of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> in a general way. People will be interested in such things as t he number of languages in which it is published, how many copies are printed of each issue, the number of lands in which it is distributed and that it is read by people of all religions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Wasn’t that a fine idea to carry “Let </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True'&quot;</span><span class="font14"> along with us and use it as a secondary offer </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font14"> 3) one year alone. But expansion did not stop there. The very next year, in 1962, another district was added. Now we are very happy to tell you that in February 1965 two more new districts will begin functioning. So we will have 28 districts in the United States. One of the new districts is in the area of northern California and southern Oregon and the other one is near New York City in the Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania area.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">So as each of us has a little part in the service we are encouraged by seeing the evidences of progress and expansion in our territory. We pray that you will each have many happy experiences as you continue enjoying Jehovah’s goodwill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">SECOND MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: As God’s “Men of Good Will’’ Do Not Hold Back. Song- 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Letter from The Brooklyn Branch Office is discussed by two mature publishers, in the truth many years, who have watched missionary work expand into various countries. They rejoice in this report. Comment on last two items of Theocratic News. 10 min: “A United Effort Blessed with Success.’’ Talk.

<p><span class="font2">THIRD MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Serving Whole-souled as “Men of Good Will.” Song 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: “Can You Devote 100 Hours a Month to Jehovah as a Pioneer?” Question-and-answer coverage. January “Kingdom Ministry&quot; insert. Assign to mature brother, assistant congregation servant, if qualified. Read paragraphs as time permits. Weave in Theocratic News item from Pleasant Hill, Missouri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Will We Do It Again?” Article will be thoroughly discussed by means of audience participation. Include Theocratic News item from Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Will You Vacation Pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(3 min.) Chairman who has pioneer spirit enthusiastically encourages vacation pioneering in April. 13,025 publishers in United States did so last April. Mention number who did locally. How will our congregation do this year? A number of publishers are considering it. True, some have obstacles, but now is time to discuss and plan to overcome them. Audience invited to ask for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(10 min.) Married sister with four children tells her problem, is invited to platform to discuss it. Chairman notes need of rescheduling, family cooperation, early start in morning, mutual arrangements with other sisters to care for children, etc. Some segments of usual routine may have to be set aside for month; either being cared for in month before or after. Discuss briefly the Schedule on page 6 of January “Kingdom Ministry” insert and encourage making it out now. Sister decides she can and will vacation pioneer. Others, such as teen-age youngster with limited spring vacation, and older retired brother with time but not transportation, are interviewed and helped with practical schedule. Suggestions on working-nearby territory, arranging to work with others who have transportation, etc., are discussed. These, too, see how they can vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(2 min.) CHAIRMAN: Obstacles can be overcome with advance planning. Application blanks available for all who will apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">7 min: Concluding comments. Handle Announcements as they apply locally. Song 89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOURTH MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Conducting Ourselves as God’s “Men of Good Will.” Song 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Hold a Good Conscience.” Article from September 1, &nbsp;1964,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Watchtower.” (The matter of conscience is a factor in many decisions a Christian must make. However, this does not mean that it makes no difference what a person does.) Assign this talk to mature brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: Handling Expired and Undeliverable Subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Each year congregations receive over 840,000 slips for expired subscriptions. Over 30,000 subscriptions are undeliverable each year because of illegible writing on subscription slips or people moving without leaving a forwarding address. We are concerned. They are missing life-giving truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (3 min.) Bible study servant explains to conductor arrangement for calling on persons whose subscriptions have expired. He gives slips to conductor for his territory. Conductor then gives slips to publisher originally obtaining the subscription, if possible. Among slips is an “Undeliverable Subscription Follow-Up&quot; slip. Name of publisher obtaining subscription has been noted on the slip by accounts servant. Conductor inquires what should be done with this. Calls can be made to obtain reason for nondelivery or to obtain correct information. Possibly wrong street has been shown, house number transposed, etc. (Next scene introduced.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (3 min.) At meeting for service, conductor discusses makingcalls on subscription expirations. (1) Friendly greeting; if person is known, renew acquaintance. If not, then give appropriate introduction identifying self as associated with the organization publishing “The Watchtower” (and/or “Awake!&quot;). (2) Give current sermon. (3) Present subscription for both magazines and start study in “Good News&quot; booklet. (Conductor introduces next scene.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE III (4 min.) Publisher makes subscription expiration call. Follows all steps; gives abbreviated sermon. Obtains new subscription; cheeks slip for accuracy and legibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE IV (3 min.) Conductor next talks with publisher who obtained undeliverable subscription. Suggests calling at address shown on the slip, and they do so. No such number found. Publisher suggests they try one block over. Householder is located and expresses concern about not receiving magazine. New address is noted on slip. Study started in “Good News” booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Outline procedure for handling back-call slips. Mention following points about undeliverable subscriptions. (1) Return to address given. (2) If not found, check adjoining streets, house with similar number, names on mailboxes in apartment houses, etc. (3) Make discreet inquiries of present tenant or neighbors as to new address. Check phone directory or other such sources. (4) If address on slip is correct, check with post office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Using these suggestions will aid many to receive “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” where the subscription expired or is undeliverable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Question Box. Committee has discussion to decide if certain couple in the congregation should be granted use of Kingdom Hall for their wedding. The brother had approached Bible study servant, was told it was committee matter and that they would be happy to consider it. Bible study servant commended for handling matter this way. Committee now examines and discusses Question Box material carefully so they will be fully informed, can discuss points properly with couple, and matter will be handled theocratically to satisfaction of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Concluding comments. Comment on slogan at bottom of page 4, tying in points from last week's service meeting. Song 83.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Impart God’s Progressive Revelation to Mankind. Song 77.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Share in the Happy Outcome Jehovah Gives.” Chairman asks questions to highlight point being-made in paragraph. Then simply read the experience or experiences from “Yearbook” to illustrate that following up all interest will bring results. (See also “yb,” p. 135 fl3; p. 149 fl: p. 240 UI.) Just reading experiences aloud will drive home the point. Make question-and-answer portion fast-moving, leaving time for experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “What You Should Know About Alcoholism.” Talk by mature brother on article in January 22, 1965, “Awake!&quot; Stick to the material in the article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk by accounts servant on meeting with congregation servant. At their meeting they will discuss: Instructions on congregation accounting, especially need for auditing accounts regularly, per instruction sheet. Importance of accuracy in taking subscriptions. Include comments on privilege of contributing toward congregation expenses. Select appropriate points from pages 281-284 in 1964 “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Congregation servant gives talk on theme for March, “Impart God’s Progressive Revelation to Mankind,&quot; and weaves concluding comments in as application of these points. (See “Watchtower,” March 1, 1965.) Song 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do Not Hold Back! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’(l)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">during January? Let’s continue doing so in February. Also, we will continue to suggest that they read the individual copies of the magazines, which we place for 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> It really is in the power of our hands to do good in this world where so many concentrate on what is bad, isn’t it ? Yes, with what we have to offer, and especially if we are prepared to demonstrate the value of 77/c </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> we have the power to do a tremendous amount of good. How satisfying it is to know that our wholesome and generous giving can aid interested persons to learn of the way that leads to life! With a motive as tine as this, surely we cannot hold back.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Will We Do It Again?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> We should—and we will, if all of us support April vacation pioneering as in the past. Since vacation pioneering has especially been suggested for April the last two years, look what has happened! In 1963, the first year vacation pioneering was really highlighted for April, the grand total of 10,379 responded, compared to 3,468 in April 1962. Last April the number jumped still higher, to 13,025. Will we do it again? Will we have another increase in the number who vacation pioneer this April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> We will, if all of us who served previously do it again and others join in April vacation pioneering. The Society is pleased to invite all baptized publishers who have been regular in service for the last six months to respond to the call. We will be happy indeed to receive your application.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Publishers of all age-groups and circumstances commendably responded last April. A goodly number of servants were able to vacation pioneer and do their secular work. School-age publishers took advantage of the school vacation period and worked out schedules that enabled them to vacation pioneer. Housewives, retired persons, parttime workers, some well up in years, many who formerly were regular</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Overseer should meet with accounts servant and work with him in the service early in February. See page 2 for points to discuss. Also, literature servant should meet briefly with them. His duties and those of accounts servant can thus be coordinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The following program should be followed at all service centers. February 14, review and demonstrate starting studies in “Good </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News” </span><span class="font12">booklet, especially on initial call. (See June 1964 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> page 2.) February 21, discuss how to demonstrate specific points from a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article. (See page 1, “Do Not Hold Back!&quot;) February 28, making calls on subscription expirations and undeliverable subscriptions. (See page 2.) March 7, discuss importance of making back-calls wherever interest is shown. (See “Share in the Happy Outcome Jehovah Gives.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The Society appreciates very much the generosity and consideration shown by brothers in the congregations who have sent packages of used clothing to Brooklyn. We have been able to use some of this for shipments overseas and have also been able to supply warm clothing to students of Gilead who came from tropical countries. However, we have now accumulated quite a large supply of the clothing. Therefore, we request the brothers not to send packages of used clothing to Brooklyn. No doubt it would be helpful to many of the pioneers or some needy families if the brothers would arrange for local distribution of the clothing they are no longer using.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and the April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will be special issues. </span><span class="font14">and special pioneers, and some with physical infirmities vacation pioneered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The greatest month of Kingdom activity on record was last April. New peaks were reached in publishers, hours, magazines, back-calls, Bible studies and subscriptions, and in vacation pioneers. The activity of the vacation pioneers contributed greatly to making possible the excellent report. And many enjoyed their service so much that they either extended their vacation pioneering or are now serving as regular pioneers! Will we reach new peaks again this April? Yes, if those who vacation pioneered last year do it again and encourage others to join them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> With all of us who are now serving as vacation, regular and special pioneers, servants in local congregations, and circuit and district servants, talking up and encouraging others to vacation pioneer during April, we will do it again. Publishers, why not encourage one another to serve together? How many vacation pioneered with your congregation last year? Wouldn’t it be nice to better the number this year? We at headquarters look forward to being able to rejoice with you in seeing a new peak in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> will feature the subject “The Coming Banquet for All the Peoples.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will be on the timely subject “Movements Toward Religious Unity—What They Mean to You!” All will want to give them special distribution. Publishers will want to plan to place at least 30 magazines during April; pioneers 200 and special pioneers 300. Congregations should ascertain their needs and order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our 20-percent goal for April is 350,782 publishers. Now is the time to start working toward it by laying the foundation to take those with whom studies are being conducted and who are sufficiently advanced out in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During Memorial week circuit servants will keep the regular schedule serving congregations except that the usual Friday meeting with the committee will be moved to another time. Congregations being visited by a circuit or district servant may ask these brothers to handle the Memorial talk. In all cases they will give the April 4 talk. Congregations having a circuit assembly April 4 will have the special talk April 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Offer for May: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font12">and a booklet, for 50c. When out of stock use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font12"> and thereafter any 50c book heavily stocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Please do not mail any copies of the Society’s publications to individuals in Hungary. Receiving these things there might only cause difficulty. However, Bibles not printed by the Society may be sent. Anyone knowing of interested persons living in Hungary who </span><span class="font14">number of vacation pioneers for April.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> To answer questions and arrange special midweek field service activities for April, the Society is asking congregation committees to meet with prospective vacation pioneers at the most convenient time locally, before or after the Sunday meetings, February 21. Please attend if you are interested in vacation pioneering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> It would be appreciated if you would obtain your application, fill it out and submit it to the overseer right away. Special arrangements are being made in the office here to handle the applications as soon as they are received. If your circumstances are uncertain now, but by late in March or even the first of April you see it is possible to vacation pioneer two weeks or more, fill out an application. Your overseer will be pleased to give it immediate attention with the committee and send it to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> If the number of congregation publishers and vacation pioneers equals the 20-percent goal for the congregation, overseers will be able to write on the congregation’s report card “We Made It!” to indicate that the 20-percent increase was reached or exceeded. Wouldn’t it be wonderful for your congregation to report “We Made It!” and for all congregations to say, We did it again?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">want spiritual aid may write to the Society, giving the names and addresses. If any dedicated publisher is planning to travel to Hungary, please communicate with the Society at least two months in advance, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The February 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> has an article entitled “Cheating the Insurance Company.” You will find it a good one to place with your insurance agent and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Share in the Happy Outcome Jehovah Gives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Some months ago a publisher in Michigan was invited ro make back-calls. When she replied, “I don’t have any,” it was suggested that in the future she keep a record of all interest located. She followed the suggestion and is glad she did. Since then she has never been without back-calls, studies or the happy experiences that come with a full share in this activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> How often have you called back on a person who took no literature at all? Or do you usually not make such calls? Remember Jesus’ statement, *My sheep will listen to my voice’? Well, it’s true, and you’ve noticed that some, while refusing to take the literature for various reasons, will still listen to the message, haven’t you? Are they sheeplike persons? It will often take a back-call to find out. And it doesn’t take an experienced publisher to spot such interest. The new </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> tells an experience that illustrates the point. Two publishers in England called at a door together. The householder did not take any literature, so the publisher who made the presentation made no note of the call on his House-to-House Record. But the publisher with him</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">’Remember the effort that you personally put forth to heli) make December an outstanding month? Well, rejoice with us now in the many fine features of that report. 310,027 publishers reported, for a 6.1-per-cent increase over last year’s average of 292,318. This is the greatest number of publishers reporting in any month, with the exception of April 19G4! 13,020 more publishers reported than in December 1964.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> But that’s not all. This December we averaged 9.4 hours and 11.1 magazines; last year 9.1 hours and 10.3 magazines. And pioneers? Reporting were 8,622, our twentyninth monthly peak!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Did you enjoy placing “AZZ </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font14"> along with the Bible? Many of you had outstanding experiences. You shared these with felt that some interest had been shown, made a note of it and called back the following week. Soon a home Bible study was being conducted in that home. Whether they accept literature or not, it is these interested ones we want to help, isn’t it? (See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font14"> p. 231 par. 2; p. 212 par. 1.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> You can be sure that your circuit servant will appreciate it if you will keep a careful record of all interest you locate, whether the people take literature or not, and if you will then let him make the back-calls with you during the week he is visiting your congregation. Many happy experiences are in store for you as you do. (See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Y&lt; book, </span><span class="font14">p. 149 par. 2.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Have you ever received the name of an interested person from your overseer and been asked to make rhe call? What would you do if you found that the person lived ninety-three miles from your home over a dusty mountain road? Read the heartwarming account on page 228 in your 1965 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> and share the pleasure and happy outcome of making such a call. Yes, keep a record of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font14"> interest located. Make the back-calls, start studies and rejoice in the outcome Jehovah gives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">us. A district servant said: “The overall feeling of the brothers is that this has been one of the finest campaign items we have ever had.” A special pioneer writes: “A jewel 1 have found it to be. If you can only show it, it is placed.” So we placed 270,833 books, compared with 253,089 last year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant reports: “While visiting the Miami, Florida, Westchester Unit, 73 of the 83 publishers reported service during the week. They averaged 6.6 hours, 6.6 magazines and started 16 new home Bible studies. Two publishers asked for regular applications to start pioneering January 1, 1965.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">+ Another report from a circuit servant says: &quot;The Pleasant Hill, Missouri, Congregation reported no pioneers on previous visit of the circuit servant. This visit 10 percent of congregation (4 out of 40 publishers) already enrolled as regular pioneers, with immediate prospect of two more by next visit. Average hours of congregation increased from 9.4 to 11.8 as a result of pioneers' aiding publishers, especially in midweek service.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In Cuba all 55 baptized publishers in a congregation of 69 were vacation pioneers in January. Another congregation reports that they averaged 21 hours, 11.3 back-calls and 3 Bible studies per publisher in their efforts to aid others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A new unit has been established in Leopoldville, Congo, bringing the total to 17 units and one isolated group in this city of more than a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Brother Knorr continues his visits to branches in the Far East. At Tokyo, 1,515 heard him speak, and 3,501 attended the meeting held for brothers in Seoul, Korea.</span></p><img src="km_E_196502_files/km_E_196502-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:210pt;height:51pt;">
<p><span class="font12">for a wedding?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is a privilege open to honorable persons whose conduct has been chaste. If a dedicated couple wish to have the use of the hall, they should ask the committee well in advance. They should be Scripturally and legally tree to marry and not on probation, announced or unannounced. The committee should discuss these matters with them, and if the requirements are met, they may allow the hall to be used. Neither the overseer nor any one member of the committee should decide whether the hall may be used, as this is a decision for the entire committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If a dedicated person plans to marry an undedicated person and wants to use the hall, the committee should counsel him concerning marrying &quot;only in the Lord.&quot; (See &quot;Awake!&quot;, November 22, 1963.) If he still decides to go through with the marriage, he bears the responsibility for this. He certainly is immature and will be disqualified from servant privileges until mature devotion to Jehovah’s righteous ways is clearly demonstrated. But if he and the unbeliever are otherwise worthy, the committee may allow the use of the hall if they choose to do so. However, this does not mean that the committee approve the marriage. Whether two undedicated persons could use the hall is discussed in “The Watchtower&quot; of December 1, 1960, page 736.</span></p>

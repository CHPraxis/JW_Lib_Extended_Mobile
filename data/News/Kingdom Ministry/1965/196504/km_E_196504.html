<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL, 1965 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;D<sub>O no</sub>f fo<sub>ecO</sub>me fearful of those who kill the body.”—Matt. 10:28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL. VIII NO. 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">My deav Brothers and Sisters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It seems we are all ready to take (*are of the important things in April. With Jehovah’s help we will hp. News from around the world shows that the congregations are looking forward to April 4 as the first big day of the month. Who knows, maybe more than one million publishers will be out in the field service that first weekend and then it will be brought to a glorious conclusion with a fine public talk at something like 24,000 assembly places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Isn’t it wonderful to think of all of Jehovah’s witnesses setting aside the month of April for special service? Jehovah’s dedicated people, north, south, east and west, will be helping others to learn how to carry on true worship. Think of it. ’ Over one million people will be ‘helping all nations to come to God’s house of prayer.’ For the first sixteen days of April all of us will be visiting friends with whom we have had Bible studies or with whom we have placed literature, such as magazine subscriptions, and these we will invite to the most important event of the year, the celebration of the Memorial of Christ’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Isn't it a shame, though, that so few people appreciate what Jesus Christ did for us? They do not know, either, that Jehovah God arranged for all this because of his love for us. It was Jehovah who sent his Son that we might gain life. If only we could express our appreciation more! If only we could do something to acquaint more people with the message of truth I But wishing won’t make it so. Work will. And it will take work to help all the people whom we have in mind getting to the Memorial celebration to get there. After that we will want to help them appreciate that they need spiritual food regularly. If they become conscious of their spiritual needs, it will not be long before their consciences will be telling them that they should be talking to others about Jehovah’s kingdom. That will make us happy, won’t it?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Your Neighbor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> No one needs to tell you that you ought to help your neighbor, because that is exactly what all of Jehovah’s witnesses spend much of their time doing. We </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font11"> to help others, and we know who it is that we are to help, because we are well acquainted with the inspired counsel that the apostle Paul wrote to the congregations in Galatia, saying: “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Luke 10:25-37: Gal. 6:10) So, while we do good to all men as we are able, we concentrate</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">If we are going to ‘help nations to come to God's house of prayer’ we have to try to get to the people. In this regard just a few weeks ago I told the 10S students in the 40th class of Gilead what languages they were going to study. Some will be studying Japanese, others Chinese, still others French, Spanish and Portuguese. Of course, those languages represent millions upon millions of people to be helped. We certainly are glad that we can send missionaries to all parts of the world to help these people of the nations. While these missionaries are going out to the ends of the earth, we have work right here at home to do. Let us all be at it diligently during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We pray, too, that Jehovah will richly bless all of you, Jehovah’s servants, with holy spirit so we will be able to continue month after month having great joy as we help people of ail nations to come to Jehovah’s house of prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I want to say, too, that the tens of thousands of your brothers in the Far East and the islands of the Pacific that I met during my recent visit there send their warm love and greetings to you. So do I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">on helping those who are fellow believers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Now, of “those related to us in the faith,” who are the ones that are our closest neighbors? Why, in most cases, the members of our own family. But if we are not careful we may find that we have developed a defect in our spiritual vision and that we no longer see clearly things that are cldse at hand. We may see those persons in other households who need help but fail to realize that help is needed right at home. That can happen easily, can’t it? But, as many of us have learned, a good family schedule can help to keep things properly balanced. It helps us to get to meetings together; it helps us to do needed studying together; and it will help us as families to have a full share in the field service during April. So, when planning how we can help others during April, let's start with our closest neighbors, our own family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Then, as we can make room for it, we will find great joy in reaching out beyond the family circle to aid others. Some of those who need our help have had only limited experience in the field service, or they may come from homes where others are not interested in serving Jehovah. Whatever the situation, they will be really grateful if we include them in our plans for field service. Then, together, we can enjoy the happiness that comes from helping others in our community to learn about Jehovah’s marvelous purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How are we going to do that during April? Well, we have some very fine special magazines to offer to our neighbors. Publishers will be striving to place thirty during the month, pioneers 200, and special pioneers 300—not because we simply want to place a lot of magazines, but because these magazines have information that magnifies Jehovah </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col. 1)</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Will They Want to Come Again?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We are eagerly looking forward to the Memorial celebration on April 16, as we know that you are. And we are hopeful that many, many thousands of newly interested ones will assemble with us on this night. Those who love Jehovah and are mindful of the gift of his Son Jesus Christ cannot help but feel moved as Memorial day draws near. Perhaps this year the greatest crowd ever to come together to celebrate the Lord’s evening meal will be assembled. Last year there were 1,809.476 who attended the Memorial worldwide. This represented 115,724 more than the previous year. No doubt even more will be present this time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But we ask, What can we do to help these many thousands to meet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regularly</span><span class="font11"> with us? If they are going to grow to spiritual maturity, Taking on the responsibilities of Christians, they need regular association with Jehovah’s people. Well, think back to the first time you attended the Memorial and try to recall what it was that impressed you. What made you want to come again?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> For one thing, the friendliness of those who greeted you when you entered the Kingdom Hall. They were warm and genuine. They came over to get acquainted and made you feel at home. As you listened to their conversation you may have realized that many had gone out of their way to bring others with them, perhaps picking them up in</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Decoration Day is Sunday, May 30. Special arrangements for magazine distribution at cemeteries may be made where advantageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Please put your Memorial report card in the mailbox immediately after Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Where possible, it is suggested that congregations arrange meetings for field service for April 16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O On April 4, 1965, the special talk “The Coming Banquet for All the Peoples” will be delivered. The April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will not be released until after the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O Suggested service center schedule: April 11, talking points on special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> to use in presenting subscription. April 18 and 25, how in a tactful way to help ones who have not been out in service to do so the morning called on, if possible. Those having 100 percent reporting may use the 18th for suggestions on following up expired subscriptions, 25th for following up subscription promises. May 2, review new sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Literature offer for May: “Let </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True”</span><span class="font10"> and booklet, 50c. If the supply is short, share what you have with one another locally. When all of these books have been placed, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font10"> or any other 50c book of which you have an ample supply locally may be used. Available from Society: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand,” What Has Religion Done for. </span><span class="font11">their car. They obviously were happy people, and people who loved one another. This made a lasting impression.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Something else that no doubt made a deep impression was the program itself. The speaker was not simply going through a ritual, but he was explaining things from the Bible in a clear, understandable way. He was helping you to understand what it all meant to you. Perhaps for the first time you realized who should partake of the emblems, and more impressively than ever before you saw the close association of the ransom to God’s gift of everlasting life. As a newcomer, there may have been some things that you did not fully understand, but what you did grasp warmed your heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> At the close of the meeting perhaps you lingered for a time to talk to those with whom you had become acquainted. It may be that one of them took you on a tour of the hall, explaining the congregation’s service chart, the provisions for obtaining Bible literature, and the library. You may have heard them talking about arrangements to go from house to house to preach to others. If so, you could not help but realize that these people lived their faith. That is what you were looking for, and that is why you came back. On Memorial night this year, do your part to help new ones to enjoy these same things, and see if they don’t come back. You did.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Another new peak in the number of regular pioneers? Yes, the 31st month in a row! In August we had 8,507, September 8,538, Octobei- 8,584, November 8,596, December 8,622, January 8,674 and February 8,700. Well done, brothers. We hope more and more will continue to make room for the pioneer ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Looking ahead to April—the vacation pioneer applications are literally pouring in. We hope even more can vacation pioneer and we say, If you can vacation pioneer, send in your application.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1965 DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you made your plans for attending one of the assemblies scheduled for June, July or August? Now is the time to do so. Assemblies are upbuilding and are a time of happiness. Be sure to arrange to attend. In your planning, include all four days (and, of course, six days for the New York assembly). Also, why not encourage and arrange for newly interested ones with your congregation to attend?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Undoubtedly for most publishers it will be practical to attend the assembly nearest to home, though you are welcome at any of the assemblies. However, in the San Francisco Bay area, due to the large publisher population, the size of the cities and the assembly facilities, we are recommending that Califor nia circuit #26 attend the Monterey assembly and that circuits #12, #13 and #22 attend at Sacramento. The difference in distance is very slight. Other congregations in this area will’attend the closest assembly. To select your assembly, please refer to the list published in the March 1 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Bear in mind that the Corpus Christi assembly is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish only. </span><span class="font11">It is the Society's intention to have Spanish programs in conjunction with English at Albuquerque, N.M., St. Petersburg, Fla.: New York, N.Y., and San Diego, Calif.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> So this summer let’s follow Paul’s advice—not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Others Who Need Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i Did you know’ that in the past ten years 263 congregations have been established in formerly unassigned territory? Wonderful, isn’t it? And yet there are still approximately three million persons living in unassigned territory. The majority of these persons will probably be reached during July through September, for already nearly 500 congregations that participated last year have advised, ‘We want to go back again this summer.’ Some publishers will vacation pioneer and others will spend whole weekends witnessing in unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">2 Although w<sup>r</sup>e know of 500 congregations that will participate, there remains territory not assigned in the following states: Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. Can your congregation share? If so, please submit an application by May 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3 In addition to some special pioneers being assigned again this summer to work territory that congregations cannot cover, to get all unassigned territory worked, we are herewith inviting “regular” pioneers to share if (1) they have transportation, (2) are free to spend two or three months in unassigned territory work, and (3) their health will permit them to spend about 150 hours in field work each month. Can you share in carrying the Kingdom message to these others who need help? If so, please write at once for further information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Aiding Young Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Young publishers make up a good part of many congregations. Most of them are eager to share in the service with others, and this is right. Was it not Solomon who urged young folks : “Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood”? And did not Jesus himself say: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise”? (Eccl. 12: 1; Matt. 21:16) As a result of the training given by their parents and the theocratic ministry school, many of these young publishers have learned to give clear Bible sermons, and they frequently work by themselves. Others need to work along with an older publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When a young publisher works along with an older person, the mature one can arrange so that both have a share in the witness, doing so in whatever way seems most fitting. They can take turns in making the presentation, or they may want to arrange so that each has a part at every door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Here is a suggestion that has worked well for some publishers. In sermon work the parent or older publisher says: ‘I am a minister,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Your Neighbor </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font11">God and that can be a blessing to those with receptive hearts. The more we place, the more people will have the opportunity to benefit from them. During April, if you can spend more than your usual time offering the magazines on Magazine Day or perhaps devote some time before the congregation book study, why, that would be tine. Or you may want to adjust your program so that you simply are spending proportionately more of your available service time this month in offering magazines. Then there are friends, relatives, salesmen and others with whom you come in touch. During April you can “work what is good” toward all these people by offering them the special issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Of course, we will still be using the “Resurrection” sermon and offering subscriptions this month. We know it will do our neighbors good and [give the name of the young publisher] is in training for the ministry. He is obeying Jesus’ command to call on people to talk about God’s kingdom and he has prepared a brief Bible sermon. [Name], will you share that interesting information with this gentleman?’ Then the young publisher proceeds with the sermon.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A similar arrangement can be used in the magazine work. After introducing yourself and the young publisher, you can say: ‘As one who himself studies the Bible, [name] has come to appreciate two Bible magazines that he would like to show you.’ The young publisher can then go ahead with his presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> This procedure has proved to be very helpful. Many householders have been favorably impressed. One said: ‘More people should take an interest in the training of young ones like this. You certainly are doing a wonderful work.’ In another case, one who had formerly opposed listened and then commended the publishers. In this way, not only is beneficial training given, but in many cases it gains the householder's attention and respect, enabling the young publisher to present the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">to receive the magazines regularly. Have you followed up on all expiration slips and promises? What about those with whom you conduct home Bible studies? One publisher felt that those on his magazine route would be glad to subscribe. The results? “Of the 30 subscriptions I obtained, 19 were obtained in this manner.” Have you tried that yet?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Last December many overseers arranged'to visit a different service center each week during the month, and they found that they were able to help many who needed it and these were very grateful for it. Overseers who can arrange to do that again are encouraged to do so. And, remember, when you compile the congregation report at the end of April, if publishers plus vacation pioneers equal your 20-percent goal, write “We made it!” on the card.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Together, then, let’s make it an outstanding month of praise to Jehovah our God!</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font1">♦ By stressing both subscriptions at the same time, and starting new studies on the first call where possible, on the circuit servant's visit to Alexandria, Virginia, Rosemont Unit, 56 publishers, four pioneers and the circuit servant and his wife obtained 63 subscriptions and started 21 new home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At Pennsylvania Circuit #12’s recent assembly, 168 publishers of the 1,400 in the circuit filled out vacation pioneer applications before the supply of applications ran out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the last six months nine regular pioneers with the Chester, Pennsylvania, South Unit, have averaged 338.2 magazines, and the 68 publishers have averaged 1 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">• Is it permissible to comply with a request from the police department or other officials to notify them when working certain territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The law of the land allows us to engage in ministerial activity without applying for a permit or license. In some places the police or officials may request that they be notified beforehand of our activity in a certain area, generally to assist them in keeping criminals from taking advantage of householders. This does not constitute applying for a permit or license and may be complied with. In some cases it may satisfy the police to state that the congregation regularly carries on ministerial activity in the area, thus making it unnecessary to notify them every time the territory is worked. Sometimes an oral report or identification cards produced by dedicated publishers will suffice. However, if names are requested, they may be submitted by the overseer or the person in charge of the group, who should be capable of presenting the facts or answering any questions. By our cooperating, our -work generally will not be interrupted by the police responding to householders’ calls.</span></p>

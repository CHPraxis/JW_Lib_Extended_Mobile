<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY, 1965</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.’’—Matt. 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL VIII NO. 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font19">We at Bethel received our copies of the 1965 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font19"> a few days ago, and what a thrill to hear the buzz of talk after some had read the first thirty or forty pages! Within a day or two the brothers here were using experiences from the new </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font19"> to illustrate points in their comments on the days’ texts. Everyone could tell that the brothers had been reading. You will want to be sure to read these experiences too, even if only a few each day. Don’t miss them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A most eventful day for us was the graduation of the 39th Gilead class on November 23. A unique feature this time was the provision Brother Knorr made so that everyone could see and hear the program. Since not everyone can fit into our Kingdom Hall, closed-circuit television was set up so that an overflow audience upstairs could also see and hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In addition to a program of fine talks, we heard some enjoyable folk music, Bible drama and words of appreciation from the students. One group effectively portrayed the situation among Christians at. Corinth that gave rise to Paul’s first letter to them. Suddenly a messenger arrived with a letter from the apostle Paul. The next scene depicted the Corinthian brothers commenting on how the timely counsel in the letter had affected them as individuals. Aly, how it made that part of the Bible come to life! Other groups showed us how local customs affect the way the field service is done in such places as Africa and South America. You will probably find more details on the program in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font19"> in a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">As you can well imagine, after living and working together for nearly a year we became very much attached to these devoted brothers. But we know that there is much for them to do in their new assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A number of the graduates, as zone servants, are assigned to serve branch offices en route home, of-</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Everyone</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1</sup> Have you read the latest issue of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font19"> What an article that is in the January 1 issue on the position each one of us must take in this nationalistic world! Did you also notice the interesting thoughts expressed on the resurrection? Why, it seems that every time a new copy arrives it is just packed with a wonderful spiritual feast. We wouldn’t be without it, would we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>2</sup> But the question is: When we locate persons who manifest interest, can we feel confident that </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Th e Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> is what they need? Will they understand it? Well, consider the very first article in each issue. In thumbing through the past few issues you find “The Gift of Christian Friendship,” “Efficiency with Consideration,” “Never Too Old to Change” and “Do You Have Sufficient Determination?” Good subjects for anyone, aren’t they? And what about the second article in the magazine? Usually, this is a pointed doctrinal discussion or an explanation of how the events of our day fulfill prophecy. Isn’t this what newly interested persons need? What a vast change there would be in their religious outlook if they fering helpful suggestions and reporting to the Office of the President on conditions as they find them. It is a wonderful arrangement that helps us all to stay closely united as a family of Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Brother Knorr told us that next year a language will be taught at Gilead, and that, commencing in 1966, the school will be graduating two classes of 100 students each year, following 20-week courses of missionary training. Perhaps some of you may one day attend. We hope so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">It is a pleasure to tell you of our many joys here, and we do hope that you too are having much gladness in your ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Your brothers at</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Needs It!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font19">absorbed what is in just these two articles in each issue for the next year! But there is more.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> There are the main articles. Many are not too difficult even for newly interested persons. How about the articles “ ‘Peace Among Men of Good Will’ or Armageddon— Which?” and “The Bible and Creation in the Light of Modern Science”? What a wealth of material designed for all sincere inquirers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> During the next four months it is going to be a real pleasure for us to talk about the resurrection to everyone we meet. Just think: the time is near when this wicked system of things will be gone and when those who love God will have the opportunity to serve him under righteous conditions. The ones we talk to at the doors will be there, too, if only they will respond to the counsel of God’s Word now. We want to help them. Not only will we be talking about this in our sermons, but during the next few months every issue of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> will contain thrilling information on the resurrection. This will be no mere review of what we have already learned. Bather, these articles will clarify our own appreciation of this Bible truth, and they are written in such clear terms that everyone can profit from them to the full.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> And here is something new. If the householder already has the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> or </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font19"> subscription, or the offer is not taken, then we can drop down to </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True?’</span><span class="font19"> for 50 cents. Won’t this be a fine arrangement for starting many new studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>6</sup> Our goal for the campaign is well within reach: two subscriptions for publishers, twenty for regular pioneers and thirty for special pioneers. Surely these goals will not be difficult to achieve if we are enthusiastic about our work, because what we have is what everyone needs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Fortify yourselves for the activity ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Theme: Fortifying Ourselves for Lifesaving Activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">12 min: Song 50. Introduction, text and comments. Family group discusses text after supper. Father asks children, “Was there any mail today?” Children say “No,” and then they are reminded they all got a letter. Discussion of branch letter ensues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">10 min: Simplified sermon. Chairman discusses with audience situations where a shorter or simplified sermon may be advisable. Experienced publisher then demonstrates reply to busy householder. “Since you are busy, I will briefly tell you why I called. All of us have lost loved ones to our enemy, death, and would like to see them restored to life again. Jesus gives the comforting hope that a resurrection to life is possible, as recorded at John 11:25. [Read.] In ‘The Watchtower’ this Bible subject of the resurrection is being thoroughly discussed. [Show current article on resurrection and specific point of interest from it.] A year’s subscription of twenty-four copies is yours for a contribution of only $1.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Younger or less experienced publishers could use the following suggested simplified sermon. Younger publisher demonstrates. After brief introduction: “Life after death is a subject that has interested mankind since the time of the first man, Adam. That life through a resurrection is possible is shown by Jesus’ words at John 11:25. [Read. | To help you understand this subject of resurrection and many other Bible subjects, you should read the ’Watchtower’ magazine. A year's subscription is yours for just a $1 contribution.” Chairman concludes, urging all to use complete or simplified sermon as the occasion calls for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">8 min: Two younger publishers discuss Theocratic News and Announcements that pertain to congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">18 min: “Everyone Needs It!” Cover by question-and-answer discussion with * audience. When considering paragraph 3 a publisher in audience can say: “I was reading in the new ‘Yearbook’ . . . ,” and then relate the experience on page 218, paragraph 1. 12 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts servant’s report. Cover “How Did We Do in November?” and December report for congregation. Song-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Theme: Increased Activity by Overcoming Obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">10 min: Song 23. Introduction, text and comments. Daily text is considered at the conclusion of a home Bible study. It is explained to student that we do this every day in our homes. Plans are made for the householder to receive a copy of the “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">15 min: Two study conductors discuss suggestions about service activity when publishers are confined to home because of sickness or bad weather conditions. It would be opportune time to write those who consistently are not home when house-to-house calls are made. Also, can write to expired-subscription calls who cannot be contacted. Current sermon can be given from “Kingdom Ministry” and a tract or handbill can be enclosed with letter. Such activity is not to take the place of regular witnessing opportunities, but can be done by young and old publishers when sickness or bad weather interferes. Publishers in audience can relate experiences from new “Yearbook” about witnessing by mail. (P. 85 112; p. 174 112; p. 157 111; pp. 128 1T3—129 112; p. 180 A3; p. 186 S2) Also include any local experiences. 10 min: Talk by mature brother on material in the December 8, 1964, “Awake!” article “Fads Undermine Faith.” (Stick to examples in the article. Emphasize Bible principles set out there.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">17 min: Overseer covers material in pioneer insert under heading “Giving-More Attention to Kingdom Interests.” Have prepared questions and read all paragraphs in summary. Encourage publishers to study material beforehand and bring “Kingdom Ministry” insert to meeting. Application of scheduling time should be made to congregation publishers as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">8 min: Concluding comments. Song 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Theme: Fortify Yourselves for Active Share in Caring for Sheeplike Ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">5 min: Song 87. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">30 min: Consider article “Do You Make All Your Back-Calls?” Fifteen minutes can be spent discussing article. Also, comments from the audience can be entertained on what might possibly happen from the time literature is placed until the return visit is made. (Opposing wife berates husband, magazines get misplaced, etc.) Emphasize that they need our help. Fifteen minutes could be used to demonstrate: (1) Transition from offer into “Good News” booklet on initial call. (2) Making back-call, using “Good News” booklet to start study. (See paragraph 5 of article.) (3) How study conductor organizes group so that back-calls are made and house-to-house work is done. Show how definite arrangements can be made for all to share in house-to-house work and back-call activity if some publishers make back-calls at the beginning of service on Sunday or cannot stay out a full three hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">15 min: “Keep It Simple.” Consider material in article and illustrate points by using current sermon. Remind publishers to save articles appearing in “Kingdom Ministry” since September, 1964, on essentials for effective witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">10 min: Concluding comments. Congregation servant poses question to audience: “Some have asked if it is all right to buy articles at rummage sales or to donate articles to religious organizations such as the Salvation Army. Is this all right?” Get comments from audience to highlight principles involved. See Question Box for points to be covered. Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">(Overseer will arrange program to fit needs of the congregation. Weaknesses mentioned on the last report of the circuit servant could be used as a basis for points to be featured on the program. If meeting attendance is a weakness, some time can be spent giving practical suggestions on how to give assistance along these lines. The experience from Taiwan in the 1965 “Yearbook” (p. 238 1J2) could be related, showing the good results from giving personal assistance. If parents are riot studying with their children regularly, encouragement can be given along these lines. Suggestions on how to deal with local objections or situations met in field ministry could also be included in the program. Careful selection of points to be given attention and adequate development of ideas will make for an informative and truly beneficial program.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Theme: Aid Others to Become God’s “Men of Good Will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">8 min: Song 26. Introduction, text and comments. Sister from divided home discusses text with child at lunch time or right after school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">10 min: Talk on theme for February, “Aid Others to Become God’s ‘Men of Good Will.’ ” (See “Watchtower” of February 1, 1965.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">17 min: “Gain the Most front the Ministry School in 1965.” School servant invites comments from audience on first part of article and then new arrangement in connection with ministry school is made clear. Demonstrate how reports will be given and explain what is expected in handling-material in this way. This arrangement can also be used if, due to unforeseen circumstances, a student talk has to be reassigned with very short notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">15 min: Audience discussion of November 1, 1964, “Watchtower” article “Be Honest in Everything.” Various ones in audience can be called upon to read some of the main scriptures setting forth the principles applied in article. Then situations set out in the article should be posed to the congregation. Ask what is right; then ask for reason why. Some statements may be presented as true or false, or situations can be mentioned where one must make a decision. Be certain the brothers understand the principles involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">10 min: Concluding comments. Include brief report from literature servant, from his seat, on meeting with overseer. Publishers can be encouraged to use older literature in stock for personal library or home Bible studies, etc. Mention can be made of particular books and they can be displayed after the meeting. Include local experiences in obtaining subscriptions. Song 43.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">During November special pioneers, pioneers and congregation publishers placed a total of 190,669 books. Well done! You will be pleased to know that the factory here in Brooklyn has just now completed the 7th printing of the “Babylon” book, bringing the grand total printed thus far to 2,482,923. Think of all the good that wiil be accomplished as interested persons read this fine publication and are assisted through the back-call and Bible study activity to learn how they too can flee from Babylon the Great before her destruction.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GIVING MORE ATTENTION TO KINGDOM INTERESTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">This supplement should be kept because each of the six parts will be considered separately on the service meeting during the months of January 1965 through June 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">i When Jesus said that we should keep “seeking first the kingdom,” what did he mean? He meant that our chief concern in life should be expanding the earthly interests of God’s heavenly kingdom. As a Christian, you are dedicated to God. You have said that you want to do his will, and this should be your main purpose in life. How much attention are you devoting to Kingdom interests? Living in this system of things, Jehovah’s people have many things to do other than preaching. In many cases, out of necessity, these other interests take even more time than is actually devoted to the interests of God’s kingdom. Nevertheless, we can still heed Jesus’ words and give </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">chief attention </span><span class="font19">or concern to the interests of the Kingdom by the way we regulate our lives. Spiritual matters must come first. Material matters must be secondary. Jesus assured that, if we do this, we will have our daily provisions, when he said: “All these other things will be added to you.” Jesus’ words remind us of Proverbs 3:9, 10: “Honor Jehovah with your valuable things and with the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">first fruits</span><span class="font19"> of all your produce. Then your stores of supply will be filled with plenty; and with new wine your own press vats will overflow.” The application is clear. Put Jehovah and his worship first, and other needs will be cared for.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">2 Although you may now be devoting more time to other responsibilities than to Kingdom interests during the course of a month—and most publishers do—what is your </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">chief</span><span class="font19"> concern in life? Could you possibly give more attention to Kingdom interests, so placing these in a more important place in your life? One of the best ways to do this is to serve Jehovah as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">3 The words surrounding Jesus’ comment quoted above indicate that he understood that his disciples would have need for material things. He endeavored to show them, though, that while these “other things” would be necessary, they would be provided for by Jehovah if they put the Kingdom interests first in their lives. He was showing them that they should not become ‘involved’ in material interests to the exclusion of spiritual interests or to the point where they would be giving very little attention to them. —2 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">•i To what pursuits are you devoting your time each month? How are you using your “valuable things” and the greater portion of your time? Is it possible for you to make more room for the ministry, becoming a pioneer? Would this not be an excellent expression of faith, enlarging your </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">chief</span><span class="font19"> concern in life, which is your interest in the Kingdom? Serving as a pioneer is an excellent means to become fully absorbed in your worship of Jehovah God. Because of the urgency of the matter, the Society requests that each dedicated person give this matter prayerful consideration. See if it is possible to reduce time devoted to other matters, or even eliminate certain things altogether, to make room for the pioneer service in your life. What a blessing is in store for those who do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">5 We are convinced that many can arrange their affairs to devote at least 100 hours a month to Jehovah’s service as regular pioneers. In other cases this may not be possible, but if that is so, is it not quite likely that you could make room in your life to serve Jehovah at least once a year as a vacation pioneer? In either event you would be giving more attention to Kingdom interests. How satisfying that would be!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CAN YOU DEVOTE 100 HOURS A MONTH TO JEHOVAH AS A PIONEER?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">i Many brothers and sisters have said: “I have often thought of pioneering, but I do not feel that I can put in 100 hours each month. With the work that I have to do around the house, my secular obligations and other responsibilities, it would be impossible for me.” Perhaps this is the way you have viewed the pioneer ministry. True, in this system of things there is much to do, but proper management of affairs can help one to accomplish the most during the course of each day or week. It is for this reason that </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">scheduling time daily proves to be a blessing</span><span class="font19"> to all within the New World society. Those who do so are often able to see that out of the 720 hours available in each month, they can find 100 hours to devote to Jehovah as pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">2 Before you can decide whether you can pioneer, you must sit down and figure out what time you can devote to the ministry each day. So let us ‘sit down and figure out’ whether you can become a pioneer.—Luke 14:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">3 In this supplement you see reproduced a sample daily schedule that the Society provides for all regular pioneers. When a regular pioneer receives this schedule, it is, of course, blank and it is up to him to fill it in to fit his circumstances. The filled-in portion in our sample is not meant to fit all situations. It is only a sample, January, 1965 “Kingdom Ministry” designed to show you how you may well be able to arrange your time to pioneer. For a well-balanced ministry, it is suggested that you apportion your time </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">each day</span><span class="font19"> of the week so that you can reasonably care for your ministry and other responsibilities, as well as your health. (Luke 19:47) Although this schedule shows each day’s service starting at 9 a.m., you will want to start at a time suitable to the territory in which you work, which in some cases may be earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">4 In examining the schedule you will observe that the Society has indicated thereon only the essentials related to personal and family study, congregational worship and field service. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font19"> of this on the sample schedule comes to a weekly total of 39 hours. This means that on this schedule during the week, there are still many waking hours left to care for other duties, depending upon </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">when you start your day. </span><span class="font19">Retiring at a reasonable hour allows sufficient rest for early rising and will enable you to accomplish much more each day.—Jer. 7:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">5 Look at the schedule. Are you a housewife with children? In many instances you are not required to do any secular work, but you have many other responsibilities. This schedule allows you to get the children off to school, care for other duties during some mornings, and still get into the service each day, being home when the children return. If they come home for lunch or if you pick them up at school, adjust your schedule accordingly. It allows time for cooking, cleaning the house, shopping and other duties. Some sisters are also required to engage in a few hours of secular work each week, but with good scheduling of their time they are able to arrange their affairs to do so and to pioneer. We commend them for this. Are you a father? Undoubtedly you are required to engage in some secular work to care for your family, and very likely you have congregational and many other duties to perform. You, too, may very well be able to arrange your affairs to pioneer by maintaining a practical personal schedule as well as a family schedule. Now do you understand why many call this schedule a blessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">6 Of course, single persons without family responsibilities are often in a more favorable position to pioneer. They usually need to do some secular work, and this sample schedule allows for that. But it may be that you would have to devote two or three full days to secular work. Or you may need to devote some mornings to secular work, and afternoons and an additional evening or two to field service. If so, adjust your schedule accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span><span class="font19"> The sample schedule allows for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">scheduling of at least thirty hours each week for field service. This not only allows for time lost because of unavoidable circumstances, such as illness or accidents, but also time spent at assemblies and vacations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">s The Society recommends that you consider this matter prayerfully. Why not try out this daily schedule as a vacation pioneer for a month or even several months? You may find that it is possible to be a regular pioneer; and think of the many blessings it will bring to you and the congregation! So why not, then, sit down and figure it out? Talk to the congregation committee or the circuit servant when he next visits your congregation. They will be glad to help you work out a schedule to fit your circumstances. If you do this, you may soon find yourself a regular or vacation pioneer; but if this is not possible now, you are sure to benefit as a publisher for scheduling time to praise Jehovah’s name daily.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HEALTH, TRANSPORTATION AND THE PIONEER MINISTRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">i Jehovah’s people know that Babylon the Great has fallen and that God’s kingdom rules, and they cannot keep it to themselves. Many have found it possible to proclaim this good news as pioneers. Others have said, with sincerity, “Oh, how I would love to pioneer, if only my health and circumstances would allow it!” Many are not physically or otherwise able to be regular pioneers and, of necessity, can, as a result of scheduling time, serve only occasionally as vacation pioneers and as zealous congregation publishers the rest of the time. However, what is true in your case? Have you taken the time to figure out whether you can pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">2 Consider your circumstances as you examine the sample schedule. Note that only a little more than four hours of service, on the average, is scheduled for each day. You should arrange your daily schedule for service, though, to fit your circumstances and needs. See how each day can be arranged to care for your ministry and other duties, and also to allow sufficient time for periods of rest. If you are concerned with your health and whether you could keep up the pace, you might consider these points: After the morning service each day you could arrange to rest for a while before you care for your other duties. Or, you might find it advantageous to adjust your schedule on Tuesday to allow a period of rest after your door-to-door activity; if so, schedule your back-calls and Bible study in the afternoon instead. You can do the same with other days too. Evenings may also be utilized beneficially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">3 In addition to the concern over physical limitations, some are also concerned about the related matter of transportation. Getting territory near your home or convenient to the location of your back-call or Bible study activity during a certain day will prevent- spending too much time traveling. This is important. Why? Because organizing your ministry in this way and concentrating your efforts in a small area each day will reduce expenditures of time, money and energy. Careful use of your physical energy can help you to stay in the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> The above-mentioned suggestions will considerably reduce the need for an automobile, even for those not concerned about physical limitations. Of course, in cases where adequate public and other transportation is available an automobile may be unnecessary. (See the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font19"> supplement for December 1962, page five.) When available, public transportation can be used to get to the most populous sections of your territory. Then you should stay in that general area and concentrate your efforts there. In other cases, such as for those living in rural territories, some form of transportation may be needed, although it should be remembered that a reasonable amount of walking is good exercise. The congregation servant will gladly cooperate by arranging suitable meetings for field service so that, as far as possible, automobiles will be available at these assembly points. Take the initiative yourself and, wherever possible, make definite appointments for field service with others in the congregation who have automobiles. Good scheduling of your time and arranging your service daily in this organized way w’ill enable you not only to cope with your health problems but also to arrange for sufficient transportation for field service when needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> Why not make out a copy of the sample schedule on a sheet of paper? Use it as a congregation publisher and see the many benefits it will bring you. Try it out for a month or more as a vacation pioneer. We encourage you to make definite plans to do so any months you can and especially during the month of April and the month of the circuit servant’s visit, when all in the congregation will be engaged in much activity. Do not postpone it until later. Make arrangements now! Ask for help from other successful pioneers in your congregation or at your next circuit assembly. The committee will be happy to help. Now is the time to join the ranks of the pioneers as we all have a full share in proclaiming the everlasting good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>MEETING YOUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS A PIONEER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">i “Who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense, to see if he has enough to complete it?” These are wise words and the principle applies to one who desires to serve as a pioneer while caring for his daily expenses. It takes money to live, whether you are single or married. This calls for careful use of money and maintaining a practical budget. That it is possible to care for the material necessities of life and also to pioneer is attested to by the thousands who are now serving though their income is small. Would you like to know how they do it? Two important things must be considered by you: First, Jehovah assures you of his blessing and aid. Secondly, you will no doubt need to make some sacrifices, being satisfied with less materially. The importance of balance and moderation must be appreciated, being content with reasonable “sustenance and covering” for each day. So, why not “sit down and calculate the expense” of daily living and what adjustments you can make in order to pioneer?—Luke 14:28; Matt. 6:11; 1 Tim. 6:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">2 A budget is a plan for distributing income so as to derive the fullest benefits possible from money spent. It tells your money where to go instead of your wondering where it went. An endeavor should be made to determine the minimum weekly budget. Then, of course, it may be imperative that you reduce expenses as much as possible. (Please see the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font19"> issues of December 22, 1962, pages 13-16, February 22, 1963, pages 9-13, and March 8, 1963, pages 5-7.) Establishing a budget enables you to know how much money you will need each week. Knowing this, you can plan the amount of time you need to spend each week at a secular job. It is only reasonable that you try to make the most money you can in the least</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">। amount of time, doing so in harmony with Bible principles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> What secular work to do is for each one to determine. Much depends upon your needs, abilities and the area in which you live. Seek employment suited to you, but accept something less if appropriate and necessary. Paul made tents. Many pioneers are finding that the janitorial or cleaning trade works out well. Others share a full-time job or have created their own part-time jobs as suggested in the November 8, 1960, issue of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> Examine the sample schedule and you will observe that there are several hours available in the afternoons, from Monday through Friday, some of which time can be used for secular work. Naturally, you would not want to spend all this time in secular work. (The Society does not recommend that one maintain a full-time secular job on a permanent basis and attempt to be a regular pioneer.) The sample schedule does show, though, that this time is available and may be scheduled accordingly. Some pioneers work two or three days in succession, or about twenty hours a week. Others work at a secular job only three or four hours a day from Monday through Friday. Reducing expenses will keep the number of hours you must engage in secular work to a minimum.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">5 The Society encourages you to “sit down and calculate” your budget as you also arrange a schedule of secular work to meet your financial responsibilities and to pioneer. We believe that many of you can do so and receive much happiness, even as you have received much joy for scheduling time as a publisher. If you find, after sitting down and figuring it out, that it is not possible in your case to become a regular pioneer, why not arrange to serve as a vacation pioneer at least once a year? You will be glad you did, and you can be sure that your joys will be greatly multiplied.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>YOUR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE PIONEER MINISTRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">i A spiritually strong family unit is busy in Kingdom service and enjoys rich blessings as a result of scheduling time to do so together. Consider the following experience. This family writes: “Out of the seven members of our family, only the six-year-old has not tried to vacation pioneer yet. To see our children so busy with the Kingdom work and not having any time for the worldly children is a joy that no one can have unless he actually experiences it in the family unit.’’ In another family, the following is reported of the pioneer father: “He has three boys and a wife who is having her fourth child soon. He sticks to a good schedule and provides for his family in a material way. His family is very active, as his wife conducts many Bible studies and even his nine-year-old son conducts a home Bible study. As a family, they serve as a fine example.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">2 These expressions eloquently describe what can happen when </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">all members of the family work together </span><span class="font19">so that one or more can pioneer. It is this aspect, namely, working together as a family unit, that will enable each to fulfill his family responsibilities and may make it possible for some to pioneer. Have you taken counsel with your family regarding this? Have you considered the possibility of one or more members of your family serving as pioneers? Can it be done? We know it can be, as shown above. But to reach this goal the family must sit down and consider the matter together. (Luke 14:31) Reducing expenses and making sacrifices may be called for. But having sufficient food for each day, adequate clothing for all and suitable living quarters, the family can be content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">3 There are many family responsibilities to be considered, such as housecleaning, cooking and many other domestic as well as congregational duties. A </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">family schedule</span><span class="font19"> on which each member is assigned certain duties will greatly aid in getting things done each day. The Society encourages you to “sit down and take counsel” with one another and determine how the same thing could be true in your family. You will find that the family schedule helps, not only in enabling all to be zealous publishers and one or more to pioneer, but also to do a better job of fulfilling family responsibilities. It is just as one pioneer put it: “Pioneering not only brings much personal joy but it affects your relationship with others, including family members. Knowing that pioneering does not excuse one from other obligations, it has made me a more conscientious wife and mother, as well as a better housekeeper.” So “take counsel” together as a family unit and see how it will be possible for </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">all of</span><span class="font19"> you together to help at least one member to serve as a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">4 The matter of pioneering deserves the most serious consideration. Meditate upon it. Make it a matter of prayer. Thereafter, take practical steps in harmony with your prayer. Arrange the sample schedule to fit your circumstances. If this proves to you that you can do so, then do not hesitate to fill out an application for the regular pioneer service. If you believe that you cannot be a regular pioneer, then be a vacation pioneer at least once a year. You will be certain to say as did one pioneer: “The happiness that pioneering brings is beyond expressing.” Even if you cannot pioneer, we encourage you to copy this schedule and use it. We truly believe that it will be of great help to you. You will see how reasonable the goal of ten hours a month is. You will also be able to arrange regular study periods, and it will assist you to do a better job of caring for your other responsibilities. As you consider the urgency of the matter, undoubtedly many will be stirred to plan now to have a fuller share in expanding Kingdom interests and embracing the pioneer service, as all of us serve together faithfully. We are continually “praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.”—Col. 1:9, 10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT SERVANTS' RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">i Those of you who are circuit and district servants can do much to assist and encourage pioneers. Your work is not merely to aid publishers to take up the pioneer service but to show a loving interest in all who are pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">- Every time you visit a congregation you have a meeting with the pioneers, and this provides a wonderful opportunity to give them needed help and encouragement. Make it a stimulating, upbuilding meeting, one that will enable them to be better equipped for the ministry and that will give them a fresh outlook on problems with which they have been confronted. In addition to this meeting, work with them individually during the week. Find out in what way they personally need assistance, and then arrange your schedule to give them that help. If you find that no arrangements are in operation for them to work at least some of the time with other publishers, profiting from the interchange of encouragement that such a provision affords, discuss the matter with the servants and other publishers and endeavor to improve the situation. Help the congregation committee to see how they can be a real help to pioneers. Make good use of the September 15, 1963, letter to all committees. Then, too, if you find that some are having difficulty in meeting their service goals, do not fail to take time to sit down and carefully review their schedule with them, offering helpful suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">3 When visiting isolated pioneers and special pioneers every four months, arrange to spend an </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">entire week</span><span class="font19"> with them. In talking with them at the beginning of your visit, ascertain what needs attention and then work on these things together. Concentrate on one thing at a time. For example, you might spend a whole day working together on introductions to sermons in house-to-house work. Discuss introductions before starting out in the service and analyze them as you walk between houses; share good ideas that you have picked up from other publishers. Another day you might emphasize fitting the sermon to the individual householder, or starting studies on the initial call. When making back-calls, you might use one day to emphasize how to start off return visits or how to lead into a study, another to impress the importance of calling back on </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font19"> who show’ interest, yet another to stress the value of calling back soon, or use of teaching methods at home Bible studies, building up their appreciation for the organization, and so forth. Help the brothers to keep clearly in mind what Jesus said at Matthew 13:18-23, so they do not become discouraged when some who at first manifested interest allow their love for the truth to grow cold. Of course, one day will be devoted to magazine work, and then you can emphasize the development of a route, or the value of analyzing the magazines with the idea of getting particular issues to ones in the community w<sup>T</sup>ho would be keenly interested in certain subjects, such as police or school officials, businessmen with foreign contacts, and so forth. There is so much that can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1</sup> Together analyze the prospects for meetings in the territory. Take an evening to review together Study 57 in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font19"> and consider its application to the local situation. If no regular meeting is yet being held, perhaps by a concerted effort newly interested ones can be gathered together that week for a talk, after which a group study of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> can be demonstrated, with encouragement to come the following week to continue the discussion. If meetings are being held, help to build up the attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> It is vital for each one to renew his spiritual strength regularly. To assist isolated pioneers in this regard, discuss with them their program of personal study. And during the week consider the texts from the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font19"> together; do your Bible reading together; have all the regular congregation meetings together, even if there are only two or three of you. What a blessing this will be to all of you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">g</span><span class="font19"> Those who have taken up the pioneer service have shown that they are willing to take on greater responsibility in Jehovah’s service, and many of them may be in position to reach out even farther. They may be glad to know that there is opportunity for them to attend Gilead School and then take up foreign missionary work. Beginning in 1966 the Society hopes to arrange for the training of at least two hundred pioneers each year for foreign service. After a course of about five months, which will include intensive language instruction, they will be sent to other parts of the world</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">where the need is particularly great. Those who enroll must be between twenty-one and forty years of age, in good health and effective in the ministry. Persons who were baptized at least three years ago and who have been on the list as regular or special pioneers for at least two year’s will be accepted for training. Circuit and district servants may volunteer if they meet these requirements, so may Bethel family members who have had pioneer experience; former Gilead graduates, however, will not be included. So when you find persons v. ho meet the requirements for this work and who are eager to reach out for these added privileges of service, send your recommendation to the Society in a letter. There is much work yet to be done, and willing workers are needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">7 By your showing warm personal interest in those who are special pioneers, regular pioneers and vacation pioneers, they can be aided to surmount difficulties that may arise, be productive in the ministry, and a source of spiritual strength to all their brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19"><sup>1</sup> Have you looked through the titles of the talks to be given in the theocratic ministry school during 1965? If not, why not get out your new school schedule and to it right now? Just reading the titles stirs your interest, doesn’t it? Yes, we will be covering a wealth of interesting and valuable information during the year. To benefit to the full, it is most important that we regularly attend and participate in the school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>2</sup> In preparing and delivering talks, remember it is not the quantity of material that you cover that counts; the important thing is how much of it the audience remembers. So stick to the theme assigned. Make your coverage of the subject simple and clear to all. Well-chosen illustrations from everyday life that nicely fit your theme and the audience will greatly aid your hearers to remember the main points; so use appropriate illustrations. Also, make personal application of the material to your audience so all may receive the greatest instruction and benefit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> Many of you brothers and sisters in small congregations are called on to prepare talks several times a month. We know it would be a help to you if this could be reduced to perhaps one talk a month, and we believe this would be a good arrangement. To make this possible, try this arrangement: Arrange for the instruction talk always to be prepared and delivered as a model talk. Also, have at least one of the student talks delivered in talk form. This will allow for you to have counsel on the student talk, and all in attendance will be able to benefit from the counsel given each week. Then if there are not enough students to give all the stu</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Memorial date for 1965 will fall on Friday, April 16, after 6 p.m. A special public talk will be given on Sunday, April 4, entitled “The Coming Banquet for All the Peoples.” Complete copy for this talk will be provided. Please order handbills soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ Printed Memorial invitations may be ordered from the Society using the regular Handbill Order form. The price is 25c per 1,000; 15c for 500; 10c for 250. Submit your orders with remittance for these invitations at the same time as the order for the special public talk handbills, but on separate order forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ Outlines for the 1965 public talks will soon be sent to the congregations, and assignments of speakers can be made in harmony with the instructions in paragraph 134 of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span><span class="font17"> These new talks may be scheduled for April 11 and thereafter. It will be a help to </span><span class="font19">dent talks without some students giving more than one talk a month, the rest of the assignments may be covered in a question-and-answer session conducted by the school servant. One assignment might even be handled as a report; that is, a student will do what research he can on the subject and then present to the congregation the information he has found. The report will not require an introduction, conclusion or development of any particular theme, and, if you are a sister, it can be given from your seat. No counsel will be given after the report. Yet all in the congregation will have benefited from the student’s research and preparation. This arrangement will help smaller congregations to get all the instruction provided through the school without students’ having to prepare more than one school assignment in talk form each month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> Have you school servants considered that when you give counsel you have a fine opportunity to teach the students during the two minutes allotted for this? If in this time you are able to counsel on only one or two of the three points the student is working on, this is sufficient. If you feel the student will be able to work on only one point of counsel, it is all right to deal with just one point. Remember, it is not how much you say in counsel that counts; the important thing is how much the student remembers and is able to apply.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> We will be learning much at the school during the coming year. Don’t miss it. Attend regularly. Listen closely. Prepare your assignments well so you as well as others gain the most from the school in 1965.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Keep It Simple</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1</sup> Most persons we talk to in the field ministry know little or nothing about the Bible, Some have only a limited education. So if we are going to help honest-hearted ones to understand the truth, we will have to make our sermons simple, won’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>2</sup> What is it that makes a sermon simple and easy to understand? For one thing, speaking at a reasonable rate will help, and tied in closely with this is the amount of material we discuss. Much of what we have to say is new to the householder, and he can’t grasp everything at once; so don’t rush. Of course, we may be going at a reasonable pace, but, at times, we still may feel that a certain householder has not grasped the point. Perhaps it is because of the way we expressed it or because of some distraction in the home. What should we do then? Very likely it would be advisable to repeat the point, possibly doing so in different words. There will be little benefit in discussing additional material until he understands what has already been said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> It is also good to be careful in the terms we use. Words such as “Kingdom,” “Armageddon,” “remnant” and “great crowd” are everyday expressions to us, but they probably would not be correctly understood by most people we meet in the house-to-house work; so it is wise to add something that will make clear just what they mean. When giving our current sermon, we may even find that people do not clearly understand the word “resurrection,” so we ought to make clear that we are talking about God’s provision to raise people from the dead and give them opportunity to live forever in paradise conditions on this earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> Simplicity also means to be uncomplicated. For example, with our current sermon, after reading John 11 : 25, we can simply point out what the resurrection is and that it is clearly taught in the Bible. Undoubtedly, explaining the difference between the heavenly resurrection and the earthly resurrection, or trying to explain who will not be resurrected, will only complicate our sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> People listened to Jesus “with pleasure.” Not only did he speak the truth, but he made it simple and they understood. Our assignment as teachers makes it important that we do the same.—1 Cor. 14; 9.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Make All Your Back-Calls?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1</sup> Do you find that it is a problem to get all your back-calls made? Apparently many of us do. As publishers, during the past year we reported 3.3 back-calls each month, and many of these were made in connection with Bible studies conducted. But what about the many magazines, books and booklets placed as well as subscriptions obtained? Have you been calling back on all your literature placements? And whai about persons who show interest but, because of their religious training, are afraid to accept literature? These people need our help if they are going to flee from Babylon the Great before it is too late.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>2</sup> The question is: When can we find time to make all these calls? As you well know, it is not easy to find some persons at home; it may require many return calls, and that takes time. A good schedule will help. It would be good for all of us to spend at least half of our service time making back-calls and conducting Bible studies. Why keep on looking for interested persons if we are not caring for those already found?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> But you may say, I just can’t get out at the time the congregation has for back-call work. Then make back-calls when you are out in the service. Back-calls can be made at any time. Before the book study, back-call night and the third hour of service on Sunday are some possibilities. But if you talk to a person on Sunday morning at ten o’clock and you feel that this is the best time to call again, make arrangements accordingly, and then do your house-to-house work afterward.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>4</sup> If we keep accurate House-to-I louse Records we will have back-calls to make. All of us find some householders who accept literature or otherwise show a little interest, it is true that at times the interest may seem to be slight, but, remember, it is often a tiny seed that grows into a strong tree. Similarly, many who showed only a little interest at first are now zealous publishers—because someone called back. In going from house to house we do not skip homes because of indifference shown the last time we were there. So, too, when making back-calls, let’s not skip any on our House-to-House Record because we have begun to feel that perhaps they really were not so interested after all. Their life is at stake, and they need the waters of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> When making the hack-call, be friendly: “How glad I am to find you at home ’ I so much enjoyed talking to you the other day about the resurrection, and I wanted to stop in for just a few minutes to see you again. I found a few points I thought you would enjoy concerning the One who is the Author of the resurrection hope. May I step in?” Then you can consider one or two paragraphs from the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font19"> booklet, perhaps starting with paragraph five, on “The True God.” Invite the householder to get his own Bible and read the scriptures. A brief review will help him to appreciate that in just a few minutes he has truly learned something beneficial. In preparing for the next call, explain that additional paragraphs in the booklet will be discussed. Do not stay too long or attempt to cover too much. Keep it simple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>6</sup> Of course, if it is convenient to start that study on the initial call, it is a good thing to do. After placing the offer, you can say: “I would like to show you briefly how this booklet can be used to obtain vital information from the Bible.” Then open to paragraph five of the “Good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booklet and use the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">same procedure that is outlined above for back-calls.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>7</sup> Those of you who are study conductors can do much to organize the service so proper attention is given to the back-call activity. If Sunday is the only time that some can make back-calls and they want to make these first and share in the sermon work later, that can be done. Of course, if back-calls can be made at some other appropriate time, make arrangements accordingly. In this way it will be possible to give adequate attention to all interested persons, and we will be following Jesus’ instructions to feed the sheep.—John 21:15-17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font17">• Should Christians buy from church rummage sales, the Salvation Army or other religious organizations? Also, what about contributing used items to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Whether a Christian purchases items from these sources or not is an individual matter. One might reason that items could be obtained from them at a saving and feel he could conscientiously obtain them since the money is payment for merchandise, not a donation. On the other hand, if one felt he would not want to do business in any way with such organizations, even by making purchases, he should follow his conscience. Of course, it is good to keep in mind that, while we should not be critical of what others do in this regard, we should also be careful not to stumble others by the course that we pursue. Consider carefully the counsel recorded at 1 Corinthians 10:23-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As for contributing items to such organizations, this is an entirely different matter. It is not a business transaction in which goods are exchanged for money or goods of equal value. Such a contribution of goods would be a voluntary offering or donation to the religious organization, part of Babylon the Great, and would make one a supporter of it. This a dedicated Christian could not do.—Rev. 18:4.</span></p>

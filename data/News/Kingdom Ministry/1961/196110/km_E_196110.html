<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> God’s kingdom is the only arrangement that can bring lasting blessings to mankind. Only under its rule is a truly new world possible. Yet, failing to appreciate this, the majority of mankind put their confidence in human schemes and support religious systems that are disapproved by God; How urgent it is for all who are whole-souled advocates of God’s new world to search for all persons of good will and assist them to conform to God’s way now!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For use during October we have just the information that will aid them the most. In the special October 8 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> facts are presented, including the testimony of numerous Protestant clergymen, showing that the churches of Christendom have rejected the Bible, do not worship the true God, have played into the hands of the Devil, have no sound hope to offer their people, and are headed for destruction. The facts are forceful, but the arguments are reasonable and will appeal to sincere persons. They will be helped to see what they must do now in order to gain New World life. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> for October 15 emphasizes the Kingdom, with the main article “When All Nations Unite Under God’s Kingdom” and another article that considers in detail the many evidences showing that already God’s kingdom has begun to rule. What a blessing it will be to all men of good will to receive these two stimulating magazines'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Both magazines should receive wide distribution, and this will be accomplished principally by the various methods of direct magazine work. While we should endeavor to share in all features of the ministry, since this is a month for special magazine distribution, it would be well to spend proportionately more time than usual in actual magazine distribution. Be sure you have an adequate supply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Of course, regular house-to-house work with a sermon is also part of our October work. You may use the sermon outlined under Presenting the Good News or any other that you find effective in your territory. This is our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription month, and we will offer a year’s subscription, with three booklets, for $1. Each publisher will want to obtain at least one subscription ; the quota for pioneers is 5; for special pioneers, 8. (During this campaign month, publishers remit only 90e on new subscriptions.)

We. rejoice and thank Jehovah for the complete one-volume </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> To show our appreciation we will want to make full use of it in our ministry. As Brother Knorr stated at the United Worshipers District Assemblies, the Bible can be used in many ways in our field ministry-right now.</span></p></li>

Each publisher will have to determine which version to use to get the desired results in his territory, but all should try quota be met? First, make it a point to share in offering the subscription from house to house </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each week</span><span class="font11"> during October. Next, wherever you place copies of the special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">make a note of the name and address and call back before the end of October; many will want to subscribe. Also, consider persons of good will on whom you call and friends whom you meet. Yes, be subscriptionconscious.</span></p>

Keep a copy in your witnessing bag for every occasion. Place a copy with anyone who is interested in a new Bible. Use it and place it on back-calls. See that every person with whom you study has a copy. Show them the benefits of the new Bible, including the extremely helpful concordance.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Speakers should use the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> from the platform. This includes use of it in connection with talks in the theocratic ministry school, as well as in public talks. The speaker should encourage the audience to follow him in looking up scriptures. Be certain to allow time for the audience to locate the scriptures. If the speaker discusses a scripture, really explains it, then new persons not adept at quickly finding scriptures will locate it before the speaker goes on to another.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">Theme: Work Whole-souled for New World Interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Talk on ‘Work Whole-souled for New World Interests.” (See “Watchtower,” March 15, 1960, pp. 169-181, and October 1, 1961, p. 598.) 15 </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font10">Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Work Whole-souled for New World Interests.” 20 min: “Presenting the Good News.” Discuss and develop new sermon with congregation.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min; Talk on New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Use the ‘New World Translation.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Various Ways to Place Magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encouraging talk on value of wide distribution of special magazines for October as each one works to make it an outstanding magazine month. Invites audience to name methods one might use. Thereafter he will interview publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Calls brother to platform and asks what he plans to do to place magazine quota. Brother will make special effort to have full share in prestudy magazine work. Why? More people are home, relaxed and receptive, placements good for short period of time. Just what do you say to them? Brother gives well-prepared presentation. Chairman asks if he will do anything elSe to place magazines. Yes, will devote one evening each week to street work in shopping center and begins to tell plans, but chairman suggests we hear from someone else on street work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Interviews sister. Does she find street work effective? Since following counsel to approach people on streets in kindly and tactful way, placements greatly increased. Does she ever approach the people sitting in cars in parking lots? Yes; demonstrates how it is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(-3 min.) In similar fashion he interviews brother about what is needed for effective store-to-store work and hears presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Interviews young publisher who advises he will do magazine work on way home from school, in addition to other times. Gives his presentation to chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Publisher is interviewed and demonstrates how he presents magazines on Magazine Day and after regular offer is not accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AUDIENCE (4 min.) Chairman commends publishers for presentations, then turns to audience and asks how they individually plan to place magazines throughout October. Various publishers offer suggestions, including: engage in as many avenues of magazine work as possible; know the magazines and make use of ten suggestions in April, 1960, “Kingdom Ministry”; use magazines on all occasions in field as well as in incidental witnessing; be well supplied with magazines each time going into field work and keep on placing magazines until all are gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Encourage publishers to make use of many good suggestions. But what can be done by publishers who are sick or elderly and unable to get out and use methods discussed? They too can have share by witnessing to those who call at their homes, to friends and relatives and by writing letters. (Relate experience in August 15, 1961, “Watchtower,” page 502.) What a marvelous witness will be given in the territory and throughout the world as each one gives full support to special magazine distribution in October!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 15 min: “New Speech Counsel Slip” —talk by school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Reviewing Our Ministry During 1961.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Overcoming Objections with “Sermon Outlines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Effective teaching calls for overcoming objections in a positive manner. At the recent district assemblies we learned that by being versatile and using Scriptural answers we could overcome sincere objections and reach our objective. A wonderful aid in this is “Sermon Outlines.” Its 244 sermons equip us to answer many Bible questions and objections. All should use it. What would you do if faced with the objection, “I have too many magazines to read already,” when you offer the “Awake!” subscription? Det’s follow along in our “Sermon Outlines” as we see how alert study conductor prepares his group to meet this objection, which 'is often met in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (8' min.) At meeting for field service, study conductor talks with group. Notes need to be prepared to answer objections, to be versatile and shift to Scriptural argument when necessary. When offering subscription, objection “I have too many magazines to read already” comes up. What may we answer? “Sermon Outlines” will help, but where in booklet will answer be found? Conductor has all turn to Section 35G (page 18) under Diterature. Group discusses points made as all look up scriptures and various ones offer comments. Though all scriptures are good, conductor suggests Matthew 5:3; John 17:3 and Luke 21:36 particularly be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (4 min.) Competent brother from group called on to answer householder’s objection. He agrees there are many magazines, and points out need for selective reading to put right thoughts in the mind. Spiritual need is not filled by most magazines. Turns to Matthew 5:3 and invites householder to read it. To fill spiritual need, knowledge that leads to everlasting life is most important. (John 17:3) One must be awake and take in information from trustworthy news sources. Jesus showed safe course to follow. (Luke 21:36) Then highlights features of “Awake!” that help to fill spiritual need and provide information that will lead to life. Group expresses appreciation for discussion and helpful aid to overcome objections. Will use “Sermon Outlines” often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Encourage book study conductors and publishers to ascertain local objections and to prepare as demonstrated, both privately and at meetings for field service. Regular use of this grand aid provided by Jehovah’s organization will enable us to be more effective in our ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Encourage all to continue diligently in magazine activity; include local experiences with special magazines.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min; Read and discuss with congregation the foreword to the “Watch Tower Publications Index, 1930-1960.” 13 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article, “Lovingly Aid All Dedicated Ones to Be Regular.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk by assistant congregation servant, offering suggestions that will aid the congregation to have a full share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Bible study servant will demonstrate how to make call on one whose name appears on subscription expiration slip. Encourage all publishers to make such calls over weekend, also, to follow through on all subscription promises before “Awake!” campaign comes to end. Encourage back-calls on new subscribers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lovingly Aid All Dedicated Ones to Be Regular</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It is a divine command for overseers to show loving concern for all in the congregation. Likewise </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font11">minister, by pursuing things that are upbuilding, can help his brothers to be faithful in Jehovah’s service. (1 Pet. 5:2; Rom. 15: 2) How' vital it is that we all be regular praisers of Jehovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When one who has been active begins to slow down or becomes irregular in the ministry, how can we show our loving concern? Make a personal call on him just as soon as possible. If the overseer is unable to do this, then he can arrange for some understanding member of the committee or other mature publisher to do so. Perhaps a problem has arisen and help can be given. It may simply be that encouragement is needed. Perhaps it would help if he had someone with whom to go in service at a convenient time. Or he may need someone to study with him in order to grow strong again. If so, lovingly arrange for it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It may be found that sickness or old age has taken its toll. Loving assistance, given as recommended at 1 Timothy 5: 1, 2, is appreciated in these cases too. Perhaps there is</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ The cover material of the New </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font10"> is a very durable vinyl, so it should wear well. However, it has a tendency to stick to the covers of other books. Therefore it would be well not to stack these two publications with supplies of other literature to be placed. ♦ Study of the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font10"> may be started at congregation book studies the first of November. If any study group has not completed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font10"> once, it should be completed before undertaking a study of the new book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ November </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">23</span><span class="font10"> is America’s “Thanksgiving Day.” Congregation servants should arrange for this to be a special magazine day. Additional magazine supplies needed for this work should be ordered by October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Early in October the congregation servant will meet with the assistant congregation servant to discuss any matters that need attention to assure continued expansion. They will give particular attention to improving regularity and increasing hours in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ Literature Offer. November: “Let </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Your Name Be Sanctified,”</span><span class="font10"> with a booklet, for 50c. December: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </span><span class="font10">with a 32-page booklet, for $1. Be sure your congregation has ample supplies on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ New publications available:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">—English</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">special need for transportation to meetings and in the service. Endeavor to arrange for it. Thoughtfulness in assigning these publishers houses where less physical energy is required to make the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">calls,</span><span class="font11"> such as first-floor calls, would no doubt help them. Also, they might spend proportionately more time on back-calls and Bible studies, where they can sit down and still make good use of their Bible knowledge. Perhaps some studies can be turned over to them. Additionally, letter writing and incidental witnessing aid in the spread of the truth and can contribute to regularity in the ministry. Remember, it is not necessarily a great amount of time that counts, but what is important is to serve in proportion to one’s individual abilities, as shown in the case of the widow who had only two coins to contribute.—Luke 21: 1-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> All who love Jehovah are wanted in his organization, and they should be made to feel wanted. It is important for us to show our love by regular participation in the ministry. It is also important to show it by lovingly aiding our dedicated brothers, that they too may continue faithfully in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Speech Counsel Slip</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> A revised Speech Counsel slip has been prepared to assist all persons sharing in the theocratic ministry school to make increasingly effective presentations from the first assignment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The qualities of speech are listed in the order in which a student might reasonably be expected to master them. Therefore, all students, regardless of their qualifications, will be counseled on the points under each heading in the order in which they are listed on the counsel slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As the student makes his presentation, the school servant will consider the first point under each of the three main headings. If he can mark the student “G” on a total of two or three points, regardless of the heading under which the points appear, then he will give only commendation in his counsel. However, if he can give only one “G,” then, in addition, he will enter a “W” or two and give appropriate counsel on the point that he feels the student will be most likely to master in the next talk. In either instance, no point should be considered out of sequence under the heading where it is listed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In this way the student will know in advance the points on which his presentation will be considered, thus allowing him to concentrate on these. If he drops behind on any point previously marked “G,” then he will be cautioned, and if it is serious enough his slip will be marked “W” and appropriate counsel given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If a student’s slip is marked with a “W,’’ no further points will be considered under that heading until he can master it. If he cannot, after three or four tries with special help from the school servant, then the point may be entered in the space “Main points on which to work,” and the student will be allowed to move on to the next point in order under the heading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>15</sup> After any student has successfully completed all points on the slip he will begin again, and the school servant will set a higher standard for him throughout, using the “Duplicate Copy” of the student’s slips that he has kept on file to guide him. Blank lines at the end of each heading may be used in counseling advanced students.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> All counsel should be given in kindness, having in mind the varying limitations and capacities of the brothers and the purpose of the counsel: to assist each minister to give the most of which he is capable and to progress in aiding persons of good will in the field ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Reviewing Our Ministry Ooring 1961</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As we look back over the 1961 service year there is cause for much rejoicing. Jehovah’s blessing upon our ministry is apparent. After getting off to a slow start in publishers, averaging only 237,543 the first three months, in December we went up to 252,097, a new peak, and by April we had 273,131 publishers reporting, a 17.4-percent increase over last year’s average. For the service year we averaged 248,681 publishers, which is a 6.9-percent increase over last year’s average of 232,632 publishers. Very fine, indeed '</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Also, it is good to see that magazine placements have increased. During 1960 publishers averaged 11.7, and this year it is up to 12, Pioneers increased from 95.5 last year to 100, thus meeting the suggested quota of 100 magazines a month, while special pioneers averaged about the same as last year, 142.6. anxious to know how these problems are going to be solved. The Bible gives the answer. It long ago foretold this time of trouble and predicted that world distress would become so great that many would be overcome by fear. (Luke 21:25, 26) The efforts of world leaders to remedy world distress repeatedly fail because they lack God’s blessing. (Isa. 8:9, 10) The only remedy is God’s kingdom, for which Christians pray. (Matt. 6:10) God assures us of a peaceful world where distress will be no more. (Isa. 2:4) That’s certainly good news, isn’t it? [Allow for response.] This good news has really been a comfort to me and I’ve found that many of my neighbors have appreciated hearing this when I’ve discussed it with them. I’ve found a wonderful source of information on this subject in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine and I’d sincerely like to recommend that you read this journal. This is the one magazine that comforts those disheartened by the failure of this delinquent world and highlights the sure hope for the establishment of a righteous world. [Make subscription offer.]”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One of the two features of our ministry deserving special attention this year with a view to improvement is Bible studies. The number of studies dropped from last year’s average of 193,920 down to 185,785 this service year. Studies conducted by publishers fell from last year’s .7 down to .6. The special pioneer study report dropped from an 8.5 average to 7.9, and studies conducted by pioneers dropped from a 4.9 average to 4.6. Back-call activity remained about the same throughout.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The other point that merits our special attention is hours spent in the ministry. Publishers dropped from an average of 9.9 down to 9.6, special pioneers were down to an average of 141.3, and pioneers dropped to 90.8 hours a month. It is suggested that all publishers try to spend at least 10 hours a month in the ministry and that</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting Number</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">City Attendance Immersed</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">San Francisco &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,213</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The total public meeting attendance for the United Worshipers District Assemblies in the United States, Canada and Europe is 481,195. Total number immersed at the thirteen assemblies in eleven weeks is 10,974.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Uruguay: During August the brothers moved into the new branch office in Montevideo. In September the building is to be used for the Kingdom Ministry School. New peak of 1,543 publishers in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Panama: Biggest and best district assembly held there to date, with total of 1,569 in attendance; 44 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Liberia: 606 publishers report service in July—the sixth consecutive peak and an increase of 28 percent over last year's average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">4- Korea: 4,677 attend public meeting at national assembly in Seoul; 245 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">4&gt; South Africa: Kingdom Ministry School has begun, with fifteen district and circuit servants, nine congregation servants and one special pioneer in the first class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">pioneers and special pioneers diligently schedule their affairs so as to meet their requirements. Remember, more time spent in the field preaching means more people hearing the good news. The more who have opportunity to hear, the greater the number who will join in praising Jehovah. That our potential for increase is truly great is seen in the fine Memorial attendance this year—451,356 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A tremendous witness was given in the United States during the 1961 service year, with 37,232,859 hours spent preaching the good news. Further opportunities lie before us in the year to come. Let each one of us, whether publisher, pioneer or special pioneer, vigorously exert himself throughout the present service year to have the greatest possible part in the work Jehovah has given us to do.</span></p>

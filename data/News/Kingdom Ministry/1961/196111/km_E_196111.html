<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“In unity I shall set them, like a flock in the pen.”—Mic. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Spread Understanding of the Word of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Never may Jehovah’s witnesses be responsible for the Bible’s being a sealed Book to anyone with a right heart! The divine command is : “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near.” (Rev. 22:10) Upon us, then, is the obligation to spread the Bible and to spread understanding also!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How many people have a Bible and yet know nothing of God’s kingdom or even of his name! An outstanding aid to an understanding of the Word of God is the new book “Let </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">'Your Name Be Sanctified,” a </span><span class="font9">volume that makes known the divine name. Use this new book as the offer during November. Energetically cover all your territory with it, using rhe sermon “God's Remedy for World Distress” or any other sermon that you can use effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Build Up Bible Study Activity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Why build up Bible study activity? Because it is through Bible studies that we spread understanding of the Word of God most effectively. Moreover, w<sup>7</sup>e are admonished : “Fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:5) How can our ministry be fully accomplished if we do not spread understanding through home Bible studies? And think, too, on what it means to people with whom we study: life. “You will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> How can we-build up our Bible study activity? Wherever you place the new book, be alert to start a home Bible study on the initial placement. If this cannot be done, then make arrangements for a return visit to start a Bible study. Also follow up all special issue magazine placements. Where the special issues were read there will be excellent opportunities for giving an additional witness and undoubtedly many Bible studies can be started. Young and old in years and time in the truth can share in spreading understanding through studies. Many brothers and sisters of school age are now regularly conducting Bible studies, with many good-will persons progressing to the point of service and dedication. Pioneers and other mature publishers who are able to start studies easily will want to train and assist others. Bible study servants should be alert to aid more publishers to share in this work. Push toward the goal of each publisher’s conducting at least one Bible study, pioneers seven and special pioneers ten. Be Bible-studyconscious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Perseverance will also help you build up Bible study activity. At the first few studies many persons are somewhat reserved or cool. Do not</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In response to Jehovah’s command to preach the Kingdom good news, faithful witnesses wisely take advantage of every opportunity to share in the ministry. Field service may be engaged in at any time convenient to the individual minister; however, much of the service performed by the congregation is done</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR NOVEMBER “tel Your Name Be Sanctified,” with a booklet, for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR NOVEMBER The Bible Spread by Jehovah’s;. Witnesses.—Rev. 22:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">in group witnessing, and, where it is possible to do so, it is good to support this arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Meetings for field service are arranged for the convenience, encouragement and assistance of the publishers. Congregations are encouraged to organize at least five such meetings for field service each week : Sunday morning, before the congregation book study, a back-call let this discourage you. How many are in the truth today who, at their first few studies, were hardly responsive or enthusiastic! So persevere in conducting studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Since next month is the time for all congregations to seek a 10-percent increase, let each one conducting a home Bible study pay close attention to material that will be presented in the second, third and-fourth service meetings. After each service meeting, apply the information. This should, result in many new persons’ spreading understanding of the Bible in December.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> So “do not seal up the words” of prophecy by negligence. Place the new book and spread understanding of the Word of God through home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What is your personal program for field ministry? Do you have regular times set aside for house-to-house work with the sermon, for magazine distribution, for back-calls and a home Bible study? Are you arranging to help other newer ones in the service? Many of these newer ones and others who need assistance have only Sunday to engage in sermon work, but they need the help of more mature ones. Can you arrange to meet with the group on Sunday morning to assist them? In many localities progress in training-program assignments requires more support of this Sunday-morning service arrangement. Brothers and sisters who are able to do so are encouraged to include this meeting for service in their program.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">Theme: The Bible Spread by Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on “The Bible Spread by Jehovah’s Witnesses.” (See “Watchtower,” October 1, 1960, pp. 584-601, and November 1, 1961, p. 668.) 20 min: Question-and-answer discussion. of main article “Spread Understanding- of the Word of God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22 min: Back-call sermon using “Book!” booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(12 min.) Chairman shows that interest found in service should never be neglected. Return calls should be made promptly with positive goal of doing all that you can to start a Bible study. With sermon on blackboard, chairman discusses it with audience, explaining proper application of each text. Using the booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New” (mn), the following is suggested:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: World Without Distress Present distress foretold</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Luke 21:25, 26 (mn, par. 46) World distress to end at Armageddon —Rev. 16:14-16 (mn, par. 49) ones will survive</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Zeph. 2:2, 3 (mn, par. 49) Paradise earth for survivors</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Ps. 37:10, 11 (mn, par. 49) We can enjoy these blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—(Front cover, then page 3, par. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(19 min.) Competent publisher demonstrates: “Hello, Mr. --- ; I’m glad</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to see you again. I really enjoyed my previous visit with you when we had an opportunity to discuss scriptures that showed us the cause for world distress. It’s difficult to be optimistic about the future when we’re surrounded with troubles, isn’t it? [Allow for response.] What a comfort it is to read the prophecies of the Bible that have foretold these things as a sign of the coming of God's kingdom! (Luke 21:25, 26; mn, par. 46) [Also discuss remainder of paragraph.] This present evil world faces destruction in the approaching war of Armageddon that Revelation 16:14-16 speaks of. [Turn in booklet to par. 49; discuss entire paragraph, looking up texts as cited.] Meek ones can confidently expect to survive. (Zeph. 2:2, 3) Distress-free world of paradise awaits faithful survivors. (Ps. 37:10, 11) This unified, peaceful world will look something like this. [Turn to front cover of booklet and discuss features of illustration.] Wouldn’t you like to be one of these happy people? [Allow for response.] Well, look what it says here about your thrilling prospects for doing so . . . [Turn to page 3, par. 1, and proceed with study as time allows.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Follow up all interest, using this sermon or any other one you find effective. Fully accomplish your ministry by using these opportunities to teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Support Meetings for Field Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Working for 10-Percent Increase in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) As a result of the zealous ministry of those associated with the New World society, together with Jehovah’s blessing, it is reasonable to expect each congregation to increase at least 10 percent in number of ministers each year. During December we put forth a special effort to meet that goal. Many with whom studies have been conducted have already started in the service this year; others will no doubt start during December if we take steps to help them now, Beginning this week and continuing for the next two weeks will be demonstrations of what might be said to Bible students to prepare them to start in service, sharing in Bible campaign in December. The first time a Bible study is conducted after you see the demonstration, apply the suggestions. The results can be the starting of many new praisers of Jehovah and reaching the goal of a<sup>1 </sup>1 O-percent increase. Take notes so suggestions can be easily applied later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">MODEL (10 min.) Publisher at Bible study discusses with student the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jesus commanded that “this good news of the kingdom” be preached in all the inhabited earth, and this is being done now in 181 lands. (Matt. 24:14) Rapid transportation and excellent communications make it possible now as never before. Though “workers are few,” more are sharing each year. (Matt. 9:37) Throughput the world there were 4,000 new ministers, on the average, each month during 1960. Tells also of local growth. Cites experiences from “Yearbook,” pages 267-8, which shows obstacles some have to overcome. Great happiness gained by those who serve Jehovah by preaching good news. Next week points on value of the Bible and need for sharing Bible truth with others to be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Apply helpful suggestions at Bible studies during week. Will be good beginning to encourage new persons to share in service during December. Be sure to be at service meetings next two weeks to learn other steps to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">6 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Romans 10:13, at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 tpin: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Talk on New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Lovingly Aid One Another to Give Sermons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Working for 10-Percent Increase in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Reaching 10-percent increase in December our goal. Demonstration last week showed first step to take at home Bible studies to build up interest in starting to share in service in December. Second step tonight. Take notes and use points at your study during week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">MODEL (10 min.) After study publisher comments to student on value of studying Bible. Student expresses appreciation for knowledge gained to date. Had no idea it would be so interesting and informative. Publisher agrees and says, in addition, it will mean everlasting life. Has student read John 17:3. Asks student where everlasting life will be enjoyed and by whom. Then publisher suggests they turn to 1 Timothy 4:15, 16; it is discussed, with stress put on “those who listen to you.” Christ set example of teaching others pure word of truth and those taught in same way follow his example. (1 Pet. 2:21) To speak pure word of truth we need clearest understanding possible of what God’s Word teaches. “New World Translation” fills need. Briefly discuss some of its merits: it accurately expresses fine shades of meaning in ancient manuscripts, restores the name Jehovah to its rightful place and uses modern English understandable to all. Refers to article, “Bible Knowledge Made Plain Through Modern Translation” (“Watchtower,” October 15), gives student copy, and suggests it be reviewed during week and some points from it discussed together next week. Student looks forward to this discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Practical discussion of value of Bible and what is expected of those taking in knowledge opens way for invitation to service. Use suggestions at home Bible studies this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Matthew 28:19, 20, at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER </span><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of Congregation Organization article “Aid Publishers to Maturity.” 15 min: Suggestions from Bible study servant for increasing back-call and Bible study service. (Congregation servant and this servant will meet early in month and discuss how this can be done in local congregation.) 15 min: Working for IP-Percent Increase in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Having used with fine results the good suggestions on building up interest in the service that were given on the previous two service meetings, note carefully how good-will person is invited to share in service and is given simple presentation to use in presenting the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">MODEL (10 min.) Publisher and student discuss merits of “New<sup>r</sup> World Translation,” using points from article in “Watchtower.” Compare one or two renderings, such as Genesis 39:8; Matthew 5:3; 1 Corinthians 10:24. Both enthusiastic about its understandableness and clarity of expression. Publisher emphasizes that it is placed for only $1, while some Bibles sell for $30. During December Jehovah’s witnesses will make special effort to get it to the people. Both agree this is most worth-while work. “You may share in it also,” student is told. “How?” “By offering the Bible to your neighbors and friends or even by calling on other people with me,” publisher tells him. “What would I say?” Could say, “Hello, my name is----. Most people believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the Bible is God’s Word, but many do not read it because they can’t understand the language in which it is written. I would like to introduce you to the ‘New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.’ [Show it.] This is the complete Bible translated from the original languages in which the Bible was written into modern English we can all read with understandingtoday. This is your copy for a contribution of only $1.” Student convinced he cOuld say this if he could remember it. Publisher gives him copy he has written out in advance. Student concerned about what he will say</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Aid Publishers to Maturity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What is the goal of every Kingdom publisher? Without doubt, it is to serve Jehovah in an effective, mature manner, bringing praise to his name. The training program has been instrumental in aiding many to achieve this goal. But what about those not in the training program who need regular assistance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> There is provision to give regular aid to each one in coming to maturity. As the overseer visits each congregation book study he should take note of those not in the training program but who need regular assistance to gain maturity. Arrangements should be made to help them. How? By arranging for a mature publisher to encourage and assist them to prepare for and participate regularly in service and meetings and to give attention to additional personal study. The overseer may ask the one conducting the home Bible study or some other mature publisher to help, explaining the importance of regular aid being given to help the publisher advance to maturity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> With this arrangement in operation, very likely there will be few names on the lists provided at the 1st and 15th of each month for study conductors, because all needing aid will be receiving it regularly. If the name of one who is being assisted appears on the list at the 1st or 15th of the month, the study conductor will immediately check with the publisher who is to provide regular assistance to ascertain the problem and to determine how help </span><span class="font8">when questioned about the Bible. Publisher encourages him to tell others just how much he has enjoyed Bible himself and to use chart of “Renderings of Scripture Texts Compared’’ in “Watchtower” as needed. Student reads over aloud what publisher has written. Publisher notes he does well and invites him to go along- with him next week to present the Bible, so they can both share in getting Bible to many persons. In meantime he could go over what he will say. Student happy to go along. Definite time is arranged.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Simple presentation of Bible will help many new persons to share for the first time in ministry. Also, younger publishers who have not yet mastered a sermon wjll find it useful. The goal of 10-percent increase may be reached as we use this fine means of starting new ones in service during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include enthusiastic discussion of article “Prepare for December Bible Distribution.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregations having a fifth service meeting in November should use the first meeting in December “Kingdom Ministry” and plan their own meeting-for the end of December.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">can be given. Conductors will encourage ones assisting and ones being assisted to prepare for service, to do field service together regularly, to study and to attend meetings. This program is a loving provision arranged for those who are not ready for the congregation’s more advanced training program but who need loving assistance to gain maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> As the overseer visits each congregation book study he will observe the progress of those being regularly assisted. In time, many being assisted will qualify and desire to be put in the training program. In the meantime, with regular, systematic aid being offered, many can be assisted to make great strides to maturity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lovingly Aid One Another to Give Sermons</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The Scriptures encourage all of us to assist one another, and such aid lovingly given results in benefits both to the more mature minister and to the less experienced one. Since much of our time in the ministry is spent in house-to-house work, it is beneficial to help one another to be equipped to present effective three- to eight-minute sermons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> A key factor is preparation together. When the sermon is discussed at the service meeting, be sure to follow in your Bible so you begin to get the “feel” of the sermon, and make notes on suggestions offered. Much good is also done when the family head lovingly sets aside time to discuss new sermons with his wife and children. Other publishers also need personal help, and they appreciate it when their study conductor or another publisher offers to prepare with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> First take time to learn the sequence of the scriptures. Look up each one; observe where it is on the page; in the margin make note of the next scripture, if this helps you. Analyze why the particular texts being used are appropriate and why they have been arranged in the order in which they appear. This lays the groundwork for the next step: preparation of introductions, transitions and teaching methods with which to draw the householder into the discussion and emphasize the key points of the sermon. Careful attention to each of these steps will result in effective sermon presentation. The same good results cannot be expected when publishers simply “go together” in service, without such advance preparation and careful planning.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Loving aid does not stop with preparation. It continues into the field service. Here it is important to remember that it takes time to acquire new skills. Not all have the same ability. Some are more fluent and expressive than others. To get started, some may want to use just one scripture; then, gradually, the others can be included as they gain confidence. Encourage new ones with commendation on good points; save other counsel until you have worked together for a number of doors. When problems arise, be willing to help out, but do not take over the discussion unnecessarily. Show patience. Lovingly arrange to work together each week until the desired progress has been made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Always look for opportunities to give loving help to one another. As you progress toward maturity, aid others to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The goal of our door-to-door sermon is to arouse the householder’s interest and then place Bible literature with him so he may progress in knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. To realize this goal, our literature offer should come as a logical conclusion to our sermon and should convince the householder he needs the literature to learn more about what was described in the sermon. To tie the sermon and the literature offer together we need an effective transition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> If you are using the sermon “God’s Remedy for World Distress,” then after reading the last scripture you might say: “It certainly is good to know God has a permanent remedy for all the world distress, isn’t it? But I’m sure you’ll agree that if we are to be privileged to enjoy these blessings, we have some responsibility toward God. This Biblestudy aid comments on that very point and says :... [Turn to page 11, paragraph 12, and, starting with the second sentence, read one or two sentences, depending on circumstances.] This constructive Bible aid draws heavily on prophecy to show that the true remedy for world distress is near and that God’s name will soon be elevated to its rightful</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When the complete one-volume </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> was released at the United Worshipers District Assemblies, everyone was thrilled' In short order the counters were swept clean of all available copies. O that we may express that same enthusiasm during December, when for the whole month we will be offering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> to everyone for $11 We will work with only the Bible; no other book will be included in the offer. However, an appropriate booklet should be left along with the Bible, with a view to starting a home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Right now, whenever there is an opportunity, place the new Bible, but especially do we want to make December a month for all-out Bible distribution. Start thinking now of position. It further shows what we must do to enjoy these blessings. I’m sure you will draw courage and inspiration from its message. You may have this copy of the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified’</span><span class="font9"> and this booklet on a 50c contribution.’’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Some may want to use a more general transition to the book, such as: “With the increase of wickedness and world distress in our day, great reproach has been heaped on God’s name so that many people doubt his very existence. However, the Scriptures show his kingdom will shortly remove all wickedness, sorrow and heartache and thus sanctify his name. No doubt y<sup>7</sup>ou have prayed for this and now you’ll be strengthened to learn that time is at hand. This Bible aid </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified’</span><span class="font9"> will help you find the proof of this in your Bible. You may have it on a 50c contribution.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> By clearly tying in the literature offer to your sermon and then demonstrating how the householder will benefit from the literature, not only will it move him to accept the offer, but it will create in him a desire to read and gain the knowledge that leads to life. So let us be alert to start home Bible studies on the initial call at every opportunity that presents itself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">those who will want a copy: those with whom you study, others on whom you make back-calls, many who have read about, it in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> and others who will learn about it when we call at their doors during December. The prospects are good. Every publisher should make it his goal to place at least one copy of the Bible during December and as many more as possible. Pioneers and special pioneers will certainly endeavor to place many of them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The demand for Bibles will be great, so every congregation should have an ample stock. Order now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> What a pleasure it will be to place this wonderful translation of the Bible in the hands of the people during December!</span></p></li></ul>

Do not make the others wait for latecomers before getting started. Morning meetings should include a discussion of the day’s text and conclude with prayer. Other meetings for field service will last only a few minutes, allowing enough time to get organized for the specific work that is to be done and to ask Jehovah’s blessing. When dismissed, all should promptly go to the territory and commence witnessing activities so as to make the best possible use of the available time. It is suggested that, if at all possible, the time of Kingdom Hall meetings on Sunday be such that all publishers can spend at least two hours in house-to-house work and an hour or so making back-calls or conducting a Bible study before attending the public talk and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font9">study.</span></p>

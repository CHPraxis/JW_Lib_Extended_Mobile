<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Exhibit Unity as Men of Good Will</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Unity outstandingly characterizes Jehovah’s people. They worship only the one true God, recognize only the one Mediator Jesus Christ, look only to the kingdom of God as the hope of mankind, and are joined together in one New World society. Being thus united in belief, they are also united in activity, and during July that unity will be manifest in their field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> This month we have a new sermon to add to the list of those we are qualified to give, as appropriate, in the ministry. “Does God Really Care?” That is a question that is often asked and one that we must be qualified to answer Scripturally. Study the new sermon, practice it, and use it well with the offer during July. Endeavor to reach everyone possible with this practical Bible discussion. Remember that in the summer people are often in the yard or on a back porch, so if you do not get a response at the front door, you may want to try the back door before going<sup>-</sup> on to the next home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> With pleasant weather in most parts of the country, it will be possible to move out into the rural territory that has not received attention during the winter months. Organize well so that the work is done effectively. If there are some small communities where there are houses fairly close to one another, arrange for most of the group to work there while one or two get the more scattered homes with a car. If it is necessary to have several in the car when working scattered homes, then the car driver may find it practical to drop off publishers at the homes, make a brief call himself and then go back to pick up the others. Good organization will make it possible for all to be busy in the ministry as much time as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Many congregations will be working their unassigned territory during July, and there should be careful advance planning for united activity. Publishers working this territory may use any sermon of their choice, offering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book on a contribution of $1.75. Make careful note of all who manifest interest, and call back on later trips into the territory. When this is no longer-possible, arrange for someone in the congregation to write letters to such interested persons from time to time to keep the interest alive. This has accomplished much good in years past. Congregations that do not have unassigned territory should make a careful check of the territory that they do hold and arrange to give</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Who is anxious to receive extra blessings from Jehovah? We all are. Increased activity in His service assures a greater reward in joys experienced. With careful planning, many who now devote only an hour or so each month will find it possible to use at least ten hours a month in the preaching of the good news.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">leaving service arrangements to chance, thoroughly prepare in advance by making a schedule that includes all features of the service. Take advantage of Magazine Day, midweek activity, prestudy w-ork, or have a personal territory to work in whenever you can for a greater share. Make a definite schedule for service and stick to it, not allowing other things to interfere.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> There are many new and less special attention to the sections that have been worked the least.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Summer months are vacation months for many; no, not vacation from theocratic activity, but vacation from secular work and certain other obligations that often make it difficult to have as full a share in the ministry as one would like. What is there that one can do that would be more refreshing, more stimulating, more upbuilding than using that time for an increased share in the Kingdom service? No matter where you are during July, no matter what else you may be doing, do not fail to meet together </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3) </span><span class="font9">experienced publishers who require personal assistance if they are to maintain regularity and increase their participation. Servants and mature ones can lovingly help them to do so by means of personal visits. Parents should plan family activity so that children can enjoy increased participation, possibly vacation pioneering. Encourage them to support magazine work and to start routes for a regular share each week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Some sisters may feel that Sunday activity is unnecessary when they go out during the week. Excellent work is being accomplished in the midweek activity and all are encouraged to continue, and whenever possible they should avail themselves of the joys and blessings of Sunday service also, aiding the less experienced publishers who get out on weekends and who can also benefit from their assistance and encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Vacations do not mean that field service must be neglected. To the contrary, many will find extra opportunities to witness while visiting friends and relatives, thus giving them a chance to hear the truth that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font9"> 4, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font9"> 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Exhibiting Unity of All Men of Good Will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on “Exhibiting Unity of All Men of Good Will.” (See “Watchtower,” December 15, 1960, pp. 748-762, and July 1, 1961, p. 405.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Exhibit Unity as Men of Good Will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Discuss and demonstrate new sermon to be used with offer for coming months. Competent brother will be chairman, with good teacher to demonstrate sermon. Invite all to bring Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Encourage all to use Bible as new sermon is discussed. May take notes on how to effectively tie scriptures together to emphasize theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PREPARING THE SERMON (8 min.) Have sermon outlined so all can see. Chairman, comments on theme, reads first scripture, asks audience for comments on scripture, also how to tie in smoothly with next one. Proceeds through entire sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Does God Really Care?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A suggested introduction: “I'm a minister and called briefly as a friendly gesture to help my neighbors with one of the foremost questions asked about God. With the continued spread of cancerous communism, increasing crime and delinquency and worldshattering events of this space age, many people are sincerely asking, ‘Does God really care?’ Has he abandoned this earth and the affairs of men? It does cause us to wonder sometimes, doesn’t it? [Let householder answer.] Many see the injustice and wickedness and wonder if God actually knows what’s going on and if he’ll ever do anything about it. Note what Kis Word says on this . . .”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. God knows what goes on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">—Jer. 16:17</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Will remove oppression, bring peace by Christ as King</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">—Ps. 72:4, 6, 7 3, God’s will to be done on earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">—Matt. 6:9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">4. Make earth glorious home</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">—Rev. 21:4, 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suggestion for conclusion: “Isn’t it comforting to know that God does care? He takes notice of the good and observes the bad and will shortly remove wickedness and oppression and restore health and everlasting life to obedient mankind. But perhaps you are thinking, ‘Well, that all sounds good, but when will such ever take place? Will we ever see it?’ Notice the comment this Bible aid has on this: [Read first three sentences from ‘Your Will Be Done on Earth,’ page 31, par. 50.] That’s certainly good news, isn’t it? This Bible help has done much to strengthen my faith in God’s promises showing that he really does care and will shortly do something about it. I highly recommend it to you, and you may have this copy along with this booklet for a 50c contribution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">MODEL SERMON (8 min.) Publisher selected beforehand gives model presentation. Householder accepts offer. Publisher then suggests demonstration on how to get most good from publications and starts Bible study using “Good News” booklet, paragraph 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Suggests that other effective introductions and transitions into literature may be used if desired. Encourages all to prepare well and use new sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 1, based on Romans 15:6.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min; New World News, Announcements and “Assembly Time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-ans.wei’ discussion of paragraphs 141-145 of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.” 20 min: “Be a Teacher as a Family Head”—talk and audience participation in discussion of points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4 and related text, Hebrews 10:25.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of paragraphs 146-153 of “Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.” 12 min: Talk on “Increasing Hours in Kingdom Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Demonstration on “Witnessing in Public Places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Street work is one productive facet of magazine work that should not be overlooked. It has unique value in keeping the Kingdom message before the public eye and in contacting persons who might never be reached in their homes. Its effectiveness depends upon the method used. Do you do it this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (1 min.) Publisher stands on street corner, calling out slogans in friendly manner as people pass by. No one stops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) This is the way some do street work. It is not improper, but neither is it particularly effective in placing magazines. Note the potential of these methods:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (1 min.) Publisher, with friendly smile and greeting, approaches person at bus stop: “Pardon me. While you’re waiting here, I’d like to take just a moment of your time to show you an article in which many people are expressing interest.” Shows the article, comments briefly on it, and places the magazines. He moves on to another person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE HI (1 min.) Publisher approaches window- shopper: ‘ ‘Excuse me, Sir. I am a minister [or doing a public service, etc.] talking briefly with people on the street today about . . .” He then gives a few interest-arousing statements or questions about subject of article he is featuring, produces magazines, invites person to take them for more information on subject and places them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE IV (1 min.) Publisher walks up to leisurely strolling person: “Hello, I am a minister desirous of sharing some very wonderful information with ail that I possibly can . . .” Turn to article, comment on it, place magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Discuss these approaches and presentations. Other suggestions may be considered. An additional valuable avenue: approaching parked cars. A number of congregations work shopping center parking lots. One has divided the parking lot into territories. Each publisher works the part of the lot in nis territory and then does street work until new cars park in his territory. Their magazine average has jumped from 13 to 22 with the help of this method. See how easily it is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE V (2 min.) Publisher respectfully approaches one sitting in car and uses Scene II presentation to place magazines. For variety he offers handbill to person in second parked car. They briefly discuss subject and then Witness offers magazines, tying them in with subject of handbill if possible, or simply stating that as a part of our work we are sharing information on ---. Publisher states and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">considers subject of article he is featuring, shows the article, presents the magazines and places them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Each of these presentations and many others can be interchanged for any of these situations. Main point: Approach people. Be polite, respectful, but also positive and direct. Use articles of current local interest. Moral themes are very effective. Work for productive magazine witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 18 min: “Congregation Organization” article “Student Talks” to be discussed by school servant, with demonstration of points and audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Talk on the importance of back-calls, based on “Yearbook” experiences. See pages 87, 121, 193, 212, 223, 235.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Fine work is being done in the field. It is encouraging to see the excellent progress being made in starting new home Bible studies. Continue to be alert to every opportunity to start them. Also, more and more publishers are applying the suggestion to start a magazine route, with fine success. Have you? Keep up the good work during July, expanding your service as you can arrange to do so, exhibiting by your ministry the unity that is characteristic of those who are of good will toward Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Student Talks</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The theocratic ministry school is an established part of the New World society’s program of education. It enables each one to develop speaking and teaching ability, to become equipped for more effective ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Endeavor to cultivate the qualities that make one’s speaking effective. The important thing is not how much you cover but how well you cover what you do discuss. Take into consideration your audience, adjusting your pace according to their ability to grasp the points presented and approaching the subject in such a way that they will readily see the value of the information to themselves. Do not merely state the key points of your talk; discuss them, emphasize them. When scriptures are read, take time to explain them, showing why they are being used and what they prove. Explain even deep Bible truths with the simplicity that is required to make them easily understood by persons of good will. Avoid a monotonous, matter-of-fact delivery. Appreciate the value of the message, and deliver it with earnestness, conviction and warm enthusiasm. These qualities should not be sacrificed simply to cover all the points in the section assigned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When sermons are given, for the third and fourth student talks, practical training is being provided for the field ministry. Whether giving a house-to-house presentation on the third student talk, or a back-call sermon on either the third or fourth student talks, present your material as you really would in the field ministry. Cover as much of the assigned material as you feel you can effectively, putting emphasis not on the</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> If your student talk is one that you plan to present as a back-call, you may make use of any back-call setting that you feel lends itself to realistic use of the material assigned. Back-calls are made under many circumstances. You may have your discussion after a home Bible study, at noon at your place of secular employment, with one who has encountered opposition to the truth from family or neighbors, or in connection with a study conducted by a parent with that one’s own child. If you so desire, you may ask your householder to take the part of a person of a certain religion, or to be a farmer, college student, mother, or something else. These points may be kept in mind by students to help them to find natural settings for the discussion of their material, but they are not points on which counsel is to be given. The important thing is not the setting or who happens to speak first or<sup>-</sup> how many times the householder interrupts with questions. What is important is that each one be helped to make progress in the development of speaking and teaching ability, and it is to this that the attention of both students and counselor should be directed.</span></p></li>

We do not expect to have any sessions in English; everything will be in French. French-speaking brothers and persons of good will may wish to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher as a Family Head</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>T</sup>The Bible places the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the family head to be a teacher. Wives are counseled to look to their husbands for instruction; children are urged to obey their fathers. Are you a teacher of your family?—1 Cor. 14: 35; Eph. 6:1-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> There is much that needs to be taught: obedience, respect and kindness when dealing with others, neatness and cleanliness, dependability and punctuality, good reading habits, and discretion in selecting companions and entertainment. All should knew how to pray. In all the activities of life the family should be helped to keep in mind their dependence upon God and their accountability to him; they should cultivate deep appreciation for the many blessings God gives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Much teaching is done right in the home. There should be a thoughtful discussion of the day’s text and family prayer every day. Time should be scheduled for regular Bible reading and study of the Society’s publications. Casual conversation also makes deep impressions and shapes family attitudes. As family head one can do much to guide family conversation into wholesome channels at mealtime. Remember, too, that actions speak louder than words. Demonstrate in your life the lessons you want the family to learn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The family head continues his role as family teacher in the service and at meetings. Just as he should periodically work with his wife in the ministry, giving her personal help to improve her ability, so he should personally oversee the progress in the ministry on the part of his children. Inculcate in them sincere appreciation for the service, enjoyment of it, and effectiveness in performing it. By your enthusiastic participation at the meetings, regularly offering comments, encourage your family to do the same. Set a good example by conscientious fulfillment of assignments for parts on the meetings too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> A wise family teacher will make learning enjoyable. He will give attention not only to what is taught, but to how it is taught, making it alive with interest. He will see to it that family activities are properly regulated, so that the program is balanced and not a harsh regimentation that takes the joy out of life. With loving interest in his family, he will always be approachable, sympathetic, ready to give Scriptural counsel to maintain the spiritual health of all the members of his household.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To fhose who say, “I don’t need your publications; the Bible alone is sufficient.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In presenting the good news from house to house we meet persons who are not necessarily opposed to our work but who sincerely object to taking our publications. They often have been advised by their religious leaders not to take the publications. How can we handle such an objection?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> It might be well to ask the individual tactfully if he agrees that the Bible is the standard for Christians. Most people will answer Yes. Then you could say, “Actually this publication goes hand in hand with the Bible. Let me assure you that the Bible is the basis for this publication by showing you the index [turn to index of publication]. Notice there are hundreds of scriptures on various subjects as outlined in the table of contents. I am sure that you will profit from reading this publication together with your Bible and that it will enrich your faith.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Some may object to taking the publications, stating that they can ask their minister for any desired information. To such ones you might say, “Most clergymen themselves have libraries in which they have research publications, such as Bible</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSEMBLY TIME</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> This is assembly time! June, July, August and September are assembly months, and during this time Jehovah’s witnesses in many lands will be gathering together for united worship at their district assemblies. If you have not yet attended an assembly, there is still ample time to make arrangements to attend one in July or August, but do it now. One thing you should do right away : Write to the city of your choice for rooming accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Those attending the assemblies will find that each of the six days provides a rich portion of spiritual food. It is invigorating to assemble with thousands of your brothers in united worship. You thus prove yourself to be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> blessing to them, and, in turn, you are built up by their association. More than that, dictionaries, Bible concordances, Bible commentaries, and so forth. Actually this publication is a reference book and fits into the same category as the ones just mentioned. [For example: Turn to “Yowr </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font9"> and refer to information in subject index under “King of the North.”] Viewed in this light, it can be a great help in answering your Bible questions and is really a treasure house of Biblical knowledge. I know you will enjoy it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When the householder makes the point that the Bible alone is sufficient, you could counter with the question: “You probably go to church, don’t you?” If the answer is Yes, then you could say, “At church you hear sermons, so I am sure you recognize the need for aid in understanding the Bible. We have found that if a sermon is worth hearing it is worth reading. In this way each one can check the proof for statements made, as advised in the Bible at Acts 17:11. So our literature is in reality a collection of printed sermons. I know you will find them helpful and uplifting.” Thus, by sincerely reasoning with those who raise this objection it is often possible tactfully to aid the person to see the practical value of our publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">after attending your assembly you will agree that you have been blessed with spiritual provisions far exceeding your expectations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> You will also have a wonderful opportunity to work unitedly with your brothers in the field ministry at the assembly city all three mornings that such service is scheduled. This should be a matter for first consideration on the part of all of us. Added to that will be the pleasure of volunteering and sharing in the work at the assembly itself, which will greatly increase your own enjoyment of the assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The main thing now, if you have not yet attended an assembly this summer, is to make plans. Y<sup>r</sup>es, this is assembly time, a time for united worshipers to assemble together.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>c</sup> There is nothing wrong in seeking recreation in outdoor activities during the summer, but it is so much more satisfying when it does not interfere with the Kingdom service. These activities are more refreshing and enjoyable when arranged after one has shared in the service first. Maintain proper balance so that the more important ministry responsibilities are given primary consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> If -we put forth diligent effort to increase our participation in the service, our joy will be full. Let each one put Kingdom interests first, faithfully striving to do more in the work of spreading the good news.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Stay Awake as Approved Slaves</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> For Christians living in this sleep-inducing ‘age of distractions’ Jesus urged wakefulness. Wakefulness to what? To the privileges that are ours as Jehovah’s slaves; to the fact, that God’s kingdom already rules and the Kingdom work entrusted to us is urgent. We cannot afford to become indifferent, drowsy, negligent in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As we enter a new service year it is good for all of us to take a careful look at what has been done during the past year and lay careful plans to assure advancement during the months ahead. It is good for the congregation as a whole to do this. It is also beneficial for each family and individual ministers to make a similar analysis.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Points to Check</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As vacationers return home, school opens and people enter their normal routine again, there are matters that ought to receive special attention by servants in the congregation. First of all, figure the averages for the last service year, establish new quotas, and post this information on the congregation chart. Did the congregation meet its quotas during the year? Does the report reflect sound spiritual health on the part of the congregation? What needs special attention? Make definite plans now to see that it gets done. Are the service centers all functioning smoothly? Are the meetings for field service instructive and well organized? Are there arrangements for midweek service? Have arrangements been made for public meetings at the service centers once a month or every other month where this seems advisable? Discuss these matters with the book study conductors and make arrangements to visit each of the groups soon to offer needed help. Is every possible effort being made to complete the coverage of unassigned territory held by the congregation? When this work comes to a finish at the end of September, remember to submit the names of good-will persons to the Society on 3&quot; x 5&quot; slips of paper<sup>-</sup>; also arrange for some capable publisher to correspond with these interested persons. Yes, there is much to be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What about individual ministers? There are matters for each one of us to check. First, are we attending all the congregation meetings regularly? Do we arrange to have some share in the field ministry each week? Are we sharing in all features of the ministry? Do we</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Maturity Is a prime objective for every Christian minister. It means being fully developed as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> Christian, having proper balance and deep appreciation Of the truth. Such maturity brings blessings from Jehovah upon the individual publisher and the entire Christian congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Throughout the 1962 service year we will specifically direct our efforts toward lovingly helping one another. Paul urged, “We . . . who are strong ought to bear the weak</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">nesses of those not strong.” (Rom. 15:1) This specific Bible command shows the necessity of helping one another. The motivating force behind it is love, for love looks out for the interests of others.—1 Cor. 13: 5; Phil. 2: 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How will we help one another? Those who are more mature will give specific attention to helping those who are less mature to build them up to spiritual maturity. In regularly conduct at least one home Bible study? Let us be awake to opportunities to reach these goals. And while we are service-minded, let us not neglect our personal study and helping new publishers to grow to maturity. Constant progress in these matters is evidence that one is awake to his responsibilities.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">what ways? To be regular in field service, to give sermons, to make back-calls and start studies, to conduct studies in an instructive manner, to direct interested ones to the organization, to prepare new ones for the service, to place magazines, to be a vacation or regular pioneer, to study, to attend and comment at meetings, to support and enroll in the theocratic ministry school and to prepare for and accept responsibility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In future months, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> will have articles that will give practical suggestions on how we can lovingly help one another to maturity. This will be a reciprocal arrangement, offering an interchange of encouragement for all. (Rom. 1:12) The training program will play a large part in it. Since progressing to maturity is everyone’s responsibility and a Scriptural requirement, this work of mutual assistance will call for the wholehearted co-operation of every servant and publisher.—Heb. 6:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Staying Awake as Approved Slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Welcome, text, comments, along with talk on “Staying Awake as Approved Slaves.’’ (See “Watchtower,” July 15, 1960, pp. 438-444, and September 1, 1961, p. 539.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Stay Awake as Approved Slaves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Earnest talk on “Totalitarian Inquisition Revived in Spain” in September 8, 1961, issue of “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Discuss and demonstrate how to place the September 8 “Awake!” with Protestants, Catholics, Jews (according to the needs of your territory), also Protestant clergymen, so they will see the importance of the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on 1 Thess. 5:6, on page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Talk on “Enjoy Pioneering Now” by competent brother. In conclusion, encourage all who can to take up the pioneer service now. Those unable may be able to enjoy vacation pioneering. Many do so each time the circuit servant visits the congregation as well as on other occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Questions and answers on Congregation Organization article “Lovingly Aid New Publishers to Be Regular.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article “Lovingly Help One Another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Analyzing Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each publisher should have his Publisher’s Record card with year’s totals and averages. Have report of entire year of congregation’s activity displayed, with totals and averages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Service year completed; well to pause and reflect on progress made, discuss potential for future year and how we can individually make our ministry more effective. Each one should take notes on suggested improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (17 min.) Review report of congregation, especially calling attention to averages as shown on chart, inviting publishers to compare their averages with congregation. Make figures alive and meaningful by showing such service represents much help given to people of good will and sanctification of Jehovah’s name. Every report was important and contributed to grand witness in the territory. Give particular attention to average hours, magazines, back-calls and Bible studies. Are we reaching the wholesome goal of ten hours each month? twelve magazines and one home Bible study? Where weak, ask for suggestions that have been made in past years’ “Kingdom Ministry” to overcome or improve it. Also, publishers who have good results may relate what they find to be effective. (Publishers should be encouraged a week before to look up suggestions for improvement in “Kingdom Ministry” on known weaknesses of congregation so discussion will be lively and instructive.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What has all this activity accomplished? How many new ones started in the ministry in our congregation during the past year? How many were immersed? Even where there were no new ones started, show what a grand witness was given to praise Jehovah’s name. Be upbuilding and encouraging. Now, what can be done to hold on to what gains have been made? How can we do even better? Ask audience for suggestions as to what potential exists for further increase from home Bible studies being conducted. What can be done to help these interested ones on to greater maturity, to association and service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Commends audience for practical suggestions and encourages all to apply helpful suggestions. What will result if applied locally? Increased praise to Jehovah, a fuller share in the great gathering work now coming to a close, and increased joy and happiness to each individual. Conclude by tying in Society’s program for 1962 service year of lovingly helping one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(NOTE: Congregations that have a fifth service meeting this month should arrange their own program, adapted to local needs, for this week, and use the material outlined below for the last meeting in the month.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk on “How to Read the Bible,” in “The Watchtower” of August I, 1961, pp. 472-475.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">22 min: Know Your October 8 “Awake!”—“How Does Protestantism Stand with God?” (Discussion and demonstration to acquaint entire congregation with contents of this special issue.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Chairman invites audience to follow along in their copy of the magazine as he briefly discusses each article. He will summarize key points made and will highlight points of interest that can be used effectively in presenting the magazines. In conclusion the audience may be invited to give their impression of the special issue with expressions on how they feel about prospects for its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Three or four publishers selected in advance will give model 30-to 60-second presentations. Each one will be given one or two articles on which to prepare presentations. Demonstrations should cover how the magazines can be presented from house to house, store to store and by approaching people waiting for buses, in parked cars, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">4 min: Chairman encourages all to start using special “Awake!” immediately on release date September 30. All are encouraged to put forth special effort to start distribution at once, sharing in morning or afternoon Magazine Day activities on Saturday the 30th (which all congregations should arrange for). Endeavor to leave the special issue whether or not the regular offer is taken on Sunday and other times the regular offer is made. Always have copies available for distribution wherever you go. Each service center will have pre-study magazine work; publishers can get territory and work it on way to study or attend brief meeting for field service at center and then go into service. See that friends and relatives not in the truth as well as persons of good will who are not subscribers get a copy and that people who are studying have opportunity to get copies to share in distributing this powerful message if they so desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include encouragement for all to share in Sunday witnessing, October 1, which is start of “Awake!” subscription campaign. Publishers may use current sermon or any one they have found effective. If subscription offer is not taken, offer two magazines for 10c, one being October 8 issue. Make notation of placement and make return call, for many after reading special issue will be anxious to subscribe.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Lovingly Help One Another </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">be achieved, thus improving the effectiveness of our ministerial activity. While Jehovah has assured us of his blessing upon our work as an organization, what will we contribute individually to the expansion work yet ahead? Are we prepared to care for those new sheeplike ones he will entrust to us? Getting solidly behind this work of helping one another will properly prepare us. Also, in past years some have slipped away from the faith because of a lack of attention. This arrangement of helping one another can prevent the falling away of others in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The program will also help to teach acceptance of responsibility. We are part of a rapidly growing organization that will fill the earth. Dependable, mature, well-trained individuals by the thousands are needed to be servants, study conductors, good pioneers and publishers to do the work Jehovah has commanded. Such persons will be available if we lovingly help one another by imparting training with a view to expansion.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION ORGANIZATION</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lovingly Aid New Publishers to Be Regular</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many have recently symbolized their dedication by water immersion. It is our hope that these new ministers of Jehovah God will grow to maturity and will walk through the open door that leads to activity, as described by the apostle Paul at 1 Corinthians 16: 9. New ones, however, need help to grow to maturity. We must lovingly show interest in them and encourage them to study, attend meetings.and share in service. If any who have recently been immersed begin to slow down in theocratic activities or become irregular in the ministry, what should we do to help them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The congregation overseer should be alert to the needs of the sheep. If he detects that one of the newer publishers has become irregular in the ministry or is slowing down in theocratic activities, he will want to see that assistance is given to correct the condition. Likely the overseer will go to the person who studied with this new one. This may be you. If the overseer comes to you and requests assistance, what should be your response? You should have a keen desire to aid the new one to make progress and become regular in ministerial service. If you have not yet finished studying with him </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life,” </span><span class="font10">likely you will be asked to resume</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Stay Awake &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We want to give it wide distribution. The article will be featured simultaneously in the September 8 issues of the English, Spanish, French, German and Swedish editions and soon thereafter in the other languages in which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">is printed. Labor Day will provide an excellent opportunity for special Magazine Day distribution of this issue. A letter from the Society has advised all congregations concerning the special attention to be given this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> During September Jehovah’s approved slaves will also keep awake by continuing to use the sermon “Does God Really Care?” as appropriate, and other sermons as the need may arise, and offering the latest books of the Society available in the congregation on the regular contribution. By our diligence let us show that we are spiritually awake, to Jehovah’s praise and the blessing of men of good will. your study with the new one and show concern for his spiritual progress. We should be concerned with the lives of the sheep, not merely the counting of time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> It is also our responsibility to see that the sheep are fed regularly in the congregation meetings. It would be good if we would not only invite them to the meetings but also accompany them. Meetings play an important role in bringing all of us on to maturity. Attending the meetings regularly is upbuilding to the newer publishers. Likewise it is most encouraging to those who are regularly attending. There is nothing like new faces to enliven the congregation. Also, new ones are incited to love and right works and this right association is very wholesome in crowding out wrong desires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If help is thus given in connection with study, service and association, undoubtedly the new one will grow to maturity, will learn how to do the divine will effectively, will have joy and satisfaction in his service, and all of this will help him to become regular in each feature of the ministry. Of course, when assistance is needed by those not yet dedicated we want to give them loving help too. It is our obligation and privilege to lovingly aid all newer publishers to be regular in the ministry. We should assume that responsibility.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Joy, happiness, true contentment and satisfaction. How well these words describe the pioneer service. Automatically they come to mind when reviewing experiences of faithful pioneers who have written about their joys in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> articles entitled “Pursuing My Purpose in Life.” A review of their experiences brings spine-tingling realization of how Jehovah is truly blessing those who put full faith in him by devoting their all to the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Does pioneering free one from all difficulties? No. It has never been easy to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as confirmed by Paul when he related his experiences at 2 Corinthians 11:23-27. So this should not discourage one from taking up the pioneer ministry. The April 1, June 1, and August 1, 1959, issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> tell of pioneers who underwent difficulties, even with their health. Others have had family problems and persecution. Nevertheless, the contentment, satisfaction and blessings received were as a result of enduring trials and continuing in pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Most obstacles to taking up pioneering are part of Satan’s propaganda program to keep people too busy to devote themselves wholeheartedly to Jehovah’s service. In the August 1, 1961, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> we read of a brother who had a musical career and found himself torn between his love for music and the pioneer ministry. The question he had to answer was, “Where would my worldly ambitions lead?” Matthew 16: 26 gave the answer. With that in mind, do not forfeit your everlasting life in Jehovah’s new world for material pursuits!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Oddly, some may discourage you from pioneering because of mistaken and immature thoughts of need for material security. Review the experiences of those who have been successful in pioneer service. Most started with just a few dollars in their pockets and testify that they have never been in want of necessary food and clothing! Theirs has been an interesting life, a full one, with rich spiritual blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Experience these same joys. Follow the example of faithful modernday pioneers as they follow Christ Jesus. Then joy, happiness, true contentment and satisfaction will be your portion as you pursue your purpose in life as a pioneer.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The success of our presentation is often determined by the effectiveness of our introduction. Of all the points in our presentation, the introduction requires the most careful advance preparation. When used skillfully, many extra opportunities to give a witness are afforded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> An introduction should accomplish a twofold purpose. First, it should be a friendly greeting, explaining who you are and why you are there. Secondly, it should capture interest and whet the appetite for the good news to follow. With well-chosen words introduce the theme of your sermon so as to create a desire for learning what the Bible says about it. Employ questions or statements that will stimulate thinking, create expectancy and prompt the householder to engage in conversation with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> While your opening words should be friendly, thought-provoking and striking, they should never be shocking. A shocking statement at the very outset could antagonize the householder as well as belittle the dignity and seriousness of your call. For example, in connection with the sermon “Man’s Future in the Space Age” one introduction stated,</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> One of the greatest obstacles we meet in presenting the Kingdom message to the people of Christendom, especially those of the Brotestant religions, is indifference. Simply belonging to a church gives them a feeling of satisfied religiousness. What can be done to wake them up to see their spiritually impoverished condition as God sees it? How can they be helped to see the Kingdom hope? Two outstanding special issues of the magazines, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.’</span><span class="font10"> for October 8 and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for October 15, have been specially designed to help meet this need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The special issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">dwells on the theme “How Does Protestantism Stand with God?” It makes clear that the standard for right worship is the Word of God and that religion that rests on the “I have a message for you from outer space.” While we may know what is meant by this, what does the householder think?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Your opening words should be spoken with confidence, in order to instill confidence. They should be distinct, never involved, maintaining simplicity and the right amount of enthusiasm. Introduce yourself and give a good reason for your call. You may wish to say: “Good morning. My name is ... I am really glad I found you at home because I have put forth a special effort to bring you a message that vitally concerns you and your family.” If you are using the sermon “Does God Really Care?” after a friendly greeting you might ask: “What mother or father does not care for his children? Few, you may rightly say. Do you think God cares for his children? [Allow for comment.] Many feel he is unconcerned and not even bothered about our welfare, but that is not so because ...”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Friendly, striking Introductions? Yes. Shocking? No. Remember, for a successful presentation capitalize on your introduction. Let it carry you right into the body of a wholesome sermon and on to a climaxing conclusion to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">philosophies and traditions of men is worthless in the eyes of God. It quotes clergymen who admit that the clergy have failed to teach God’s Word and that the churches are not worth attending. With a forceful array<sup>7</sup> of scriptures and facts, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! shows</span><span class="font10"> that Protestantism has failed.

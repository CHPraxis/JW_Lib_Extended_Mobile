<p><span class="font7">Help Men to Security During God's War</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In .spite of man’s search for security, comparatively few are prepared for the approaching war of Armageddon. Now, of all times, they need help.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Bible Distribution</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To help men find security by listening to Jehovah, this month, for the first time, we will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> offer just the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font10"> with a free booklet, for $1. While prepared to drop down to two magazines if necessary, we want to help householders see the importance of having a Bible they can understand. After giving a well-prepared sermon suited to the territory, we can acknowledge that most of us have </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> Bible whose familiar language We love. However, ancient versions use words that are often hard to understand. We can illustrate this with an example or two previously selected from the chart in the October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The effectiveness of showing householders how the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font10"> brings clear understanding is proved by the experience of a publisher who was told: “I don’t know about these modern translations. They change the Bible. Anyway, I love the beautiful language of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version.”</span><span class="font10"> Replied the publisher: “So do I love it, and we have by no means discarded It. But, tell me, when we read the Bible, do we read it for its literary beauty or to get instruction?” The householder admitted that we read to get instruction. However, when asked the meaning of “publican” and “centurion” the objector did not know. After being enlightened by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation’s</span><span class="font10"> use of “tax collector” and “army officer,” the householder agreed that it does not change the Bible but simply makes it understandable. A copy was placed and a study was begun immediately. This joy of placing the Bible and starting new studies in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News&quot; </span><span class="font10">or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font10"> booklet can be yours if you prepare well. Preparation makes the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10-Percent Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s ministers have sown much seed and faithfully watered it in anticipation of the promised increase. (1 Gor. 3:6) In December we will exert ourselves vigorously to realize an increase of 10 percent, which is a reasonable goal. Servants and study conductors, talk with publishers who conduct Bible studies and help them to encourage the new ones to start in service. Simple but effective presentations are outlined under “Presenting the Good News.” Teach new ones a simple Bible pres-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As a result of the response of many publishers and pioneers to the call to serve where the need is great, splendid progress has been made since 1957. Today many congregations flourish in formerly unassigned territory, or where an isolated group existed, or where a congregation was in dire need of servants or qualified publishers to work territory. Response has been good on the part </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">?

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of publishers and pioneers, and Jehovah’s blessing is manifest upon the arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Have you wondered just, what can be and has been done in an area as a result of this arrangement? One of many examples that could be cited is this one: In 1956 there was one publisher for every 815 persons in the United States. In 1961 it is one for 653. In 1956 entation. Help them find the joy of putting knowledge to work by asking them to join you in offering the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The assistant congregation servant will provide study conductors with a weekly list of ministers who have not yet reported in December. By receiving the list at each service meeting, conductors will be in position to extend loving aid over- the weekend. By reporting on December 3, or at least by December 10, mature publishers will shorten the lists of those not out early in December and thereby aid the servants. How good it would be to see 273,549 publishers active this month, and 273,-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued, on page</span><span class="font10"> 4, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mississippi had 1-1,906 and in 1961 it was 1-1,119.

Truly, Jehovah blessed their efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Where is help now needed?

<p><span class="font1">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Helping Men to Security During God’s War.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Helping Men to Security During God’s War.’’ (See “Watchtower,” October 15, 1960, pp. 617-631, and December 1, 1961, p. 727.) 17 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article, “Help Men to Security During God’s War.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font9"> min: New Sermon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The Bible—a True Guide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman: December to be a big month for placing the “New World Translation” from house to house. Every publisher will want to place a copy of the new Bible in the homes of as many as possible. This can best be done by stimulating a desire for this new translation through use of a sermon on the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(10 min.) Chairman has sermon displayed before audience. (“Sermon Outlines,” page 2, 3A) Calls attention to simplicity of it and encourages all to follow discussion in own Bibles and make notes as audience discusses how to tie scriptures together effectively to emphasize theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I’m making a brief call to encourage more Bible reading among people of all religions. In recent years new translations have created great interest in the Bible, and it continues to be the world’s best-selling book. Interest in the Bible has also been sharpened by recent world-shaking events of our day, causing many to turn to God’s Word for comfort and direction. So it would seem important to know more about the message the Bible holds for our day, don’t you think so? [Allow time for comment.] But perhaps you are like many others who say it is difficult to understand. And some sincerely ask how we can be sure it is a true guide at this time. Notice what one of the Bible writers had to say about this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible writers inspired by God</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">—2 Pet. 1:20, 21 Fulfilled prophecy proves Bible account true &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 14:29 or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Isa. 14:24 Understanding brings comfort and hope for future &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rom. 15:4</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We need a solidly based hope in this troubled world, don’t we? That hope can be gained by better understanding of the Bible, and that’s the very purpose of this fresh, modern translation. With its easy-to-understand English, you will delight in reading this Bible. You may have this copy and the printed sermon in booklet form for just a dollar contribution. As you read the Bible sermon you will want to look up the many Scripture references cited. Note how easily you can find them in this Bible. [Show Bible books listed in order on page 7 and then alphabetical listing for ease in finding such on page 8.] Additional outstanding features you will enjoy are Important Bible Words for Quick Reference (page 1341) and various helpful maps. [Other features may be mentioned as time allows.] Just think, all this is yours in this fine Bible for just one dollar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(8 min.) Chairman encourages all in audience to follow closely in own Bible as well-prepared publisher demonstrates sermon, makes presentation, and starts study in booklet placed with Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman encourages united effort of congregation to make December an outstanding month by placing-many Bibles. Let us be well prepared and Confidently offer new Bible to all we meet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">8 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion on “Lovingly Aid One Another to Make Back-Calls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">22 min: Following Up Bible Placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (2 min.) Bible campaign in December stirring up tremendous interest in Kingdom. Opens way for Bible studies as never before. Whether persons obtaining new Bible and booklet will use them to full advantage or not depends greatly upon each publisher. Accurate records of placements and immediate follow-up are keys to success in starting studies. Preparation also very important. Discussion of what to say on return call will help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discussion with Audience: (8 min.) Chairman briefly reviews with audience essentials for return visit: pQSi-tive attitude, warmth and friendliness, having in mind definite information to present and goal of starting study, theme, simplicity, tactfulness, enthusiasm, definite arrangements for future visits, etc., and the value of each. Then scriptures in sermon are looked up by various ones in audience and discussed. (“Sermon Outlines” provides basis for sermon—Section: “Bible” 3B, page 2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theme: Need for Help In Understanding Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Private reading of Bible not enough</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">—Acts 8:30, 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible for all, not just clergy or “wise” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 11:25</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible contains instruction for life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">—Rom. 15:4</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Purposes of Jehovah revealed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">through Bible &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—2 Tim. 3:16, 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(gn page 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publisher: (10 min.) Mature publisher demonstrates sermon. In friendly manner he greets householder and states he has returned to discuss further the value of Bible in offering a sure hope for the future. Many believe Bible is God’s Word and that it contains hope for future, but do not know where or how to locate texts expressing man’s sure hope for future. Situation much like that of Ethiopian eunuch encountered by Philip, in account at Acts 8:30, 31. Suggests householder get his Bible and read this. After this is read, publisher calls attention to need for guidance in understanding and willingness of Philip to help. Some, however, conclude Bible only for clergy or those possessing theological training. Refers householder to Jesus’ words at Matthew 11:25. Even those newly acquainted with Bible may gain understanding, as it was written for “our instruction,” and gives us hope. Calls attention to Romans 15:4 and reads it. Can have confidence in Bible, as it is inspired by God and ‘sets matters straight,’ as is explained at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. Brings out “Good News” booklet and shows this scripture cited on page 5. Then calls attention to question on paragraph 4, page 4. He discusses this and reads it, and then goes on to paragraph 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: (2 min.) And so a Bible study is started. As simply as demonstrated, you can start a study. Some may have placed the “Look!” booklet and will want to refer to page 4, paragraph 5, to start the study. Whichever booklet has been placed, return quickly and start a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Joel 2:32, at bottom of page four.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Two enthusiastic study conductors discuss and demonstrate (1) what they will do this last weekend of December to make sure all publishers with their group have been out and reported (method: not “push,” but loving aid), (2) how to aid publishers to start new ones in the field ministry, (3) arrangements for Saturday and Sunday for all to share in the witnessing work, and (4) how many Bibles the congregation has placed this month.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting Time Spent Preaching</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What an inestimable privilege and honor it is to serve Jehovah I Likewise, reporting the time spent preaching is important. Recently, however, some problems have been observed in this connection. To illustrate: on occasion field service reports are turned in without any name. Additionally, some fail to report time, feeling that their one hour or so is too insignificant, and they reason that Jehovah knows what we do and so it is not too important to report that time. Still others are not accurate in their reporting, merely estimating their hours and placements. Moreover, some just forget to report and need helpful reminders. Why is reporting promptly and accurately so important? Because these reports assist the servants to give help to all in the congregation according to their individual needs; they enable the Society to plan its work and see that all have enough equipment to use in the ministry; and they supply the basis for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> reports, which are a source of encouragement to us all and which we all so much enjoy. Also, Jehovah is an orderly, systematic God, and we want to imitate him in this regard. —1 Cor. 14 : 33.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Now that we have seen the importance of reporting promptly and accurately, the question arises, Who may report? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font10"> paragraph 52, states: “Any person who is mor-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Serve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">moving to an area where help is needed? Whether pioneer, servant or congregation publisher, single or married, with or without family, have you prayerfully given it thought? Are you really needed where you are? If your territory is being covered frequently and if you could be replaced as a servant locally, prayerfully think on this matter and thereafter talk it over with your circuit or district servant or write the Society. Many of your brothers have answered the call and are enjoying wonderful experiences and blessings. Can and will you serve where help is needed?</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">ally clean and who shows a sincere desire to serve Jehovah God may share with Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching tiie Kingdom message and may turn in a report as a congregation publisher even though he is not as yet baptized.” One who realizes what he is doing in witnessing and wants to enter his report with the congregation should be invited to do so. Explain to new publishers the reasons for reporting and invite them to make out their own reports.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Next, how can we train ourselves to report promptly and accurately? Some carry field service reports (S-4) in their Bible and record the figures at the end of each day. Each publisher should train himself to use this form regularly and turn it in each Sunday upon entering the Kingdom Hall. Study conductors can assist the publishers to form this helpful habit. In following through with the lists provided at the 1st and 15th of each month they can cheek with publishers listed and encourage them to see the importance of regularly and accurately reporting their time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> One more point that needs clarification is that we should not enter fractions of hours in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">totals. </span><span class="font10">Only round figures should be entered in the total figures of the field service report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> With loving attention to these matters many will undoubtedly appreciate the wisdom of forming the good habit of reporting promptly and accurately.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “Do you love me?” Jesus asked. Then “feed my little sheep.” It does not show sufficient love for the Owner of the “sheep” or for the “sheep” themselves simply to put some food within their reach and then leave them. No; real love is shown by giving much personal attention to such sheeplike persons, patiently making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies, regularly feeding them until they grow strong. Are you regularly sharing in this work? Are there others who need your help in order to participate more fully?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> There is no question about it, many are in need of loving aid to build up their back-call activity. The first step is to help them to see its importance as part of the work outlined in the Scriptures, perhaps using scriptures such as those found on page 139 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things.”</span><span class="font10"> Then as they share in the house-to-house ministry, teach them to keep an accurate and complete House-to-House Record, because this lays a foundation for efficient back-calling. Plan together to call back on everyone who accepts literature or otherwise manifests interest. Yes, help your companion in service to show deep concern for the lives of the “sheep,” working hard to overcome objections and to build up their appreciation for the truth. Be sure to set aside time to do this follow-up work regularly each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When assisting someone else, remember, it is not enough simply to go together. Take time to explain how you plan your return call. Show-how you select the material you want to discuss, using the House-to-House Record as a guide. Mention the key points you plan to take up, how you intend to introduce the study and then to arrange for the next call. Always be sure to include your companion in your arrangements, so he can have a share. Having worked together once, do it again. Continue to render loving aid until he is regular in back-call work and is effectively conducting a study himself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Who is there that needs your loving aid in back-call work? What about the members of your own family, the one with whom you are assigned in the training program, or other publishers with whom you are associated? Do all of them conduct home Bible studies? Do they ah make back-calls each week? If not, this is where your loving aid is needed.</span></p>

Also, parents will want to acquaint their children who do not give three-to eight-minute sermons with these presentations so that young and old in years and the truth can all have a share in house-to-house distribution of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p></li>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>&quot;Let Your Light Shine Before Mankind&quot;</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Obtain “Watchtower” Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jesus’ words show the obligation that falls upon every true Christian : He must be a light bearer. We must let our light shine by our right conduct and right works every hour, every day, every month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> April climaxes the subscription campaign; now is the time to check whether we have reached our subscription quotas. If not, there is still time. Read </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> the articles in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower ;</span><span class="font9"> then you will fully appreciate its value for all kinds of men and be better qualified to present it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Be conscious of subscriptions. Do not hesitate to offer them. Any opportunity that comes up, whether it be in the house-to-house work or incidental witnessing-, try for a subscription. Radiate sincerity and enthusiasm. Be positive. Rather than, “Would you like to have it?” state it positively: You </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font9"> that they will greatly benefit by having </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and will not want to miss the enlightenment it contains.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Make more opportunities this month for offering </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font9">In December we averaged 9 hours per congregation publisher; in January 9.1; in February 8.9. In April can we not do better? Imbued with the desire to let our light shine, surely we can! Try to be out in the field ministry each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Follow up all (1) subscription promises, (2) expiration slips and (3) places where magazines were left so that the householder could get acquainted with the journal. One publisher stated: ‘I left two magazines with a woman who said she did not wish to subscribe then, but would be glad to read the magazines. On my calling back the next week, she said she enjoyed reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> so much that she wanted to subscribe?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Work for 20-Percent </span><span class="font4">Increase'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">i Letting our light shine, Jesus said, will cause men to give glory to our heavenly Father. How? By their also becoming light bearers! With the impetus given by Memorial and the stimulus of a special talk and special magazines, April is the ideal time to invite new ones to begin sharing in the ministry of light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> To reach the 20-percent increase of 279,158 publishers all of us will need to do our utmost. Invite persons with whom you study to let. their light shine.

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> One -way to start new ones is to invite them to share in the distribution of the special magazines. New ones may also be taken on back-calls. If it is not feasible to bring persons with whom you study to the service center, get a territory nearby and go together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Let every publisher be out early in the month. Study conductors and servants should give assistance to any not reporting by April 9. Each week a list of those who have not yet let their ministerial light shine will be given to study conductors. Before Sunday, April 2, or as soon thereafter as possible, congregation servants should meet with conductors to ensure proper leadership.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> April brings us the opportunity to use two special instruments of light. These are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower of </span><span class="font9">April 15 and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> of April 22. Here are specially prepared magazines to dispel the darkness of false religion and illuminate true worship. Read them as soon as you can, and you will see how great an aid they are in letting your light shine before mankind I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> to be released right after the special talk on April 2, features the enlightening article “The Sacred Bible and Our Problem of Survival.” Here is a clear-cut warning of the dangerfacing mankind, counsel on what to do to survive and a brilliant spotlighting of the Kingdom hope. Another forceful article explains the Scriptural view concerning blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is entitled “How Well Do You Know </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Your</span><span class="font9"> Religion?” This issue contains a series of thought-arousing quizzes. Taking the quizzes and then checking the answers with those given on the answer pages will prove a most enlightening experience for persons of all religions. Not only are Christendom’s religions exposed in a way that is most unlikely to offend reasonable persons but a concluding letter directs the reader to true worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Continue to place the special issues until your supply is completely used up.

<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on “Ordained Ministers Let Light Shine,” encouraging all to share fully in April’s ministerial activities. (See “Watchtower,” January 1, 1960, pp. 12-18, and April 1, 1961, p. 215.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">35 min: Coverage of main article “Let Your Light Shine Before Mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min—Question-and-answer coverage of column entitled “Obtain ‘Watchtower’ Subscriptions.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">15 min—Talk and demonstration on “Distribute Special Magazines.” For the demonstration use suggestions in “Presenting the Good News” for the special “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Encourage all to make April a big month of light-bearing activity, to Jehovah’s glory. (Include comment on slogan at bottom of page 1, based on Ep'hesians 5:8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SECOND MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: New World News, Announcements and “United Worshipers Assemblies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13 min: Demonstration on presenting, the special “Awake!” Use suggestions in “Presenting the Good News,” and offer other helpful points for placing the special issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22 min: Demonstration on “Increasing Magazine Activity Through Magazine Routes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Magazine work reaches many people with the message of life and finds persons of good will. (See 1961 “Yearbook,” page 78.) To regularly assist interested ones found and to make magazine activity more productive, all publishers are encouraged to develop a magazine route. Learn the ease of doing so with study conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (5 min.) Study conductor does not understand how magazine route is developed. Asks magazine-territory servant for assistance so he will be able to help publishers with his study to start routes. Servant explains: Foundation laid on first call wherever magazines are placed. All that is necessary is record showing: (1) householder’s name, (2) address, (3) date of visit, (4) issues placed, (5) article featured. In two weeks return with latest magazines, make brief comment regarding interesting point made in one of previous issues (subject householder was interested in), call attention to appealing article or point in current issue and offer them to householder. Conclude with: “I’ll be happy to stop again in two weeks with the next issues, which I know you will want to read also.” To conductor’s question, “Is it that easy to start a route?” servant replies Yes, offers to demonstrate points made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Emphasize ease of arrangement, that all information needed can be kept on House-to-House Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (4 min.) Servant with conductor along demonstrates magazine presentation, places magazines, tells householder he will return in two weeks to see how journals were enjoyed and to deliver latest issues. Thereafter makes out record, as above. Then demonstrate revisit two weeks later, following suggestions above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (5 min.). Conductor amazed at ease and simplicity of starting route. Is convinced he can do it, also publishers will be happy to start routes. Wonders, though, how to coordinate routes with door-to-door magazine work. Servant suggests route calls be made on Magazine Day before new territory is worked. Those who take magazines as new territory is worked will be added to route list, while ones on route list who do not take magazines, or say they no longer wish them, will be dropped. Routes enable publishers to see who really are interested. These can be helped through regular back-calls. Conductor says he will put arrangement into effect with his group next Magazine Day; knows publishers will enjoy magazine work more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encourages all publishers to support next Magazine Day at service center, where conductor will review these points so all can start magazine routes. It will result in more magazines being placed and interested persons regularly contacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Concluding comments. (Comment on the slogan at bottom of page 4, based on 2 Corinthians 6:7.)</span></p>

Foundation for service laid by special preparation outlined in March “Kingdom Ministry.” Now, during April, congregation should have many new ones sharing in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (6 min.) Publisher comes from audience, expresses appreciation for suggestions to prepare students, asks how one to be started can best be helped to prepare presentations. Servant asks what he says at doors. Publisher gives simple, model magazine presentation. Servant commends, suggests he teach same to new one, or use one in “Kingdom Ministry,” and invite him to use it. Servant then asks what he will do when they meet up with calloused, indifferent persons. Publisher says he knows Kingdom message is doing separating work; we are looking for sheep. Servant suggests this be explained to new one. (Matt. 25) Publisher feels better about starting new one, expresses appreciation, will invite new one in magazine work this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) (Publisher and new one are at side pantomiming preparation.) New ones may begin in door-to-door work with regular offer or with magazines. Help them prepare; let them have some share in ministry. Make first day of service a joyful, happy experience. Our friend has invited new one in field; let’s see how they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (3 min.) After publisher has taken several doors, new one is tactfully invited to make presentation. Householder politely refuses offer, and as they walk away publisher commends new one and applies counsel given above by servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Make field service joyful experience by encouragement and commendation, with definite service arrangements, and we will not only reach 20-percent goal, but will aid new ones to continue serving Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviving Inactive Ones (Part I)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Recently the Society took a survey in connection with Kingdom publishers who have lapsed into inactivity. The information was obtained from the current and inactive file of Publisher’s Record cards. The results were challenging. The figures for the United States show that in the last year 10,992 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dedicated</span><span class="font9"> publishers have become inactive. In the last two years 20,512 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dedicated</span><span class="font9"> publishers have stopped their faithful preaching. Furthermore, in the last five years 68,404 publishers (dedicated and non-dedicated) became inactive. Yet during these same five years the publishers increased from 169,835 to 232,632 in the U.S.A, alone. Why have some drifted away from the truth? Is it that their hearts proved to be like rocky soil? Has the deceptive power of wealth choked the word in their case? Or did they need more careful cultivation? (Matt. 13:18-23) Do overseers know those who are spiritually weak and in need of assistance, and is help given them before they lapse off into inactivity? Since lives are involved, lives dedicated to Jehovah, we want to help them and revive these inactive ones into Jehovah’s service. How can this best be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> First of ail, overseers should keep a careful watch over the sheep. If some have become inactive during past years, memhws of the committee oi’ other mature, competent brothers under the overseer’s direction should now call on these persons and welcome them back into the fold. Jesus said that there would be great rejoicing over the one sheep that had strayed and was found, even more so than for the ninety-nine who had not strayed. (Matt. 18:12, 13) An extra effort should be made to revive these “strayed ones” during April. By going to</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When making these calls, present the latest publications of the Society, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, “Your Will Be Done on Earth&quot;</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From, Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font9"> Of course, we should have the latest copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> to offer them. Oftentimes interest can be rekindled in these who have drifted away and the latest publications can be left with them. Tactfully arrange for a Bible study if advisable or necessary. These are dedicated Christians and it is our obligation and responsibility to help them. Do not scold or chastise them; show love for them. Remember Jesus’ words: “Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.”—Matt. 18 : 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Reviving inactive ones is a very essential part of our ministry. Progress is made not only by going forward, getting new ones into the organization, but by holding on to what we have. If we had held on to the 10,000 publishers lost on the average each year for the last several years in the United States, think of the grand increase and added praise to Jehovah. With overseers checking the inactive Publisher’s Record card file and then organizing this vital work and with servants, study conductors and mature publishers co-operating in this effort, much can be done to revive these inactive ones. Just think of the joy due your congregation if only one returns to praising Jehovah ! Make April a month of reviving the “strayed ones” and helping those who are spiritually weak to I grow stronger to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s witnesses are dwelling together in unity like a flock in a pen, they look forward to continuing this spirit at the district assemblies. There are seven cities to choose from in the United States and Canada: New York, N.Y., June 20-25; Houston, Tex., June 27-July 2; Vancouver, B.C., July 4-9: Oklahoma City, Okla., Aug. 8-13; Omaha, Nebr., Aug. 15-20; Milwaukee, Wis., Aug. 22-27; San Francisco, Calif., Aug. 29-Sept. 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Undoubtedly, in most cases, publishers will desire to attend the convention nearest to them. However, you are at liberty to attend any city of your choice, with the exception that the Society would like to recommend that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> publishers living in Ohio circuits plan to attend the New York assembly if at all possible. In addition to this, the publishers living in Michigan circuits 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 should also attend New York instead of Milwaukee. Michigan circuits 3, 4, 7 will attend Milwaukee. Thus the facilities can accommodate the brothers to the best advantage,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> You will find attached to each room request form (which forms are being mailed to the congregations) instructions that should be given careful consideration in a service meeting approximately six weeks prior to the assembly. Volunteer service forms are also being sent to all congregations, and those desiring to render service on behalf of their brothers at the assembly will want to fill out the form completely and return it to the congregation servant, who will sign and forward it to the convention city where you will be attending. As you know from times past, a great deal of work is required for the successful operation of a convention. Would you not like to share the joy of rendering faithful assistance on behalf of your brothers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The Society is preparing attractive lapel cards to fit the holder that you have been using at conventions for the past several years. Congregation servants should ascertain the needs of the brothers and order the quantity of cards necessary, as well as the celluloid holders. Cards are lc each while the celluloid holders are 5c each. Bumper signs are not being provided by the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Bear in mind the question does not resolve itself to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font9"> one will attend, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">where</span><span class="font9"> will one attend. Make up your minds with positive thinking to render united worship to Jehovah in assembly this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> From the number of cards in many congregations’ files, it appears there is great potential for reaching the 20-percent increase. The number attending Memorial also spotlights this potential. Besides helping new ones, assist inactive ones. Follow the suggestions under “Congregation Organization.” Parents, fulfill your responsibility toward your children by seeing that they let their light shine during April. Congregation servants, see that the elderly and infirm are given practical aid as well as encouragement.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> With so much to do during April, make a check list of the things to be done rather than rely on memory. Use all five weekends to fullest advantage. May your congregation report: “We made it I” on the bottom of your congregation report card for April.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> Persons of good will studied with quickly recognize that they should share with others what they have learned. (Matt. 13:52) Many new ones want to help out in spreading the good news.

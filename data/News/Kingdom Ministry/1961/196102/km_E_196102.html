<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Safeguarding our God-given thinking ability will mean life to us. (Prov. 3:21, 22) What a wonderful prospect and assurance I But what about persons of good will who do not yet think God’s thoughts? Can you imagine the joy that will be theirs when they know what we know about a warless, secure and happy new world? Clear thinking on the plight of these sheep and what we can do to help them is safeguarding our thinking ability for the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In February we shall continue to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription. One sister who obtained 132 subscriptions last year said she offered both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscriptions first, dropping down to one if both were not taken. She added, “In most cases I obtained 'Doth, many persons remarking how reasonable it was.” Obviously the quotas we are to make are reasonable when we exercise thinking ability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We have had opportunity to use our new sermon and have seen that it is something people are thinking about. Even in various types of territory one publisher reports, “The offer was placed three times in one hour and a Bible study was started.” Discernment tells us he was well prepared, knew what to say and how to say it in his territory. Being at our service center each week when a prepared publisher gives the sermon before we go out in service will help us to be prepared. Practice at home. Family heads can arrange for this on the family’s study night.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Think ahead and work out convincing answers to common objections to subscribing. In the service be alert to observe what gets interest and attention in your territory. Then use what works! Share these methods with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Good judgment tells us that it is best to schedule our time for service. Since the door-to-door ministry is the most fruitful for subscriptions, try to arrange for two hours a week for that feature in your schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Consider all the other avenues for placing subscriptions: Those with whom we conduct Bible studies need </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> to advance to maturity; back-calls, especially where they did not take the subscriptions the first time but were willing to take two single copies of the magazines; interested persons on magazine routes, those met in store-to-store work or in street work, and those tor whom we have an expired subscription slip.</span></p></li></ul>

Use the Handbill Order blank, showing on it “Memorial Invitations,” giving the hour and address of the Kingdom Hall and number of invitations desired. The price is 250 for 10c, 500 for 15c Jehovah wants his sheep gathered before the storm of Armageddon breaks. Start .Bible studies with subscribers, that they may learn and flee to safety.

We will want to be diligent to feed these sheep once found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Bible-trained thinking will not allow us to slow down in February. Encourage and help all, including the new and the less experienced ones, to keep regular.

The Society is asking every congregation in the world </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> arrange this public talk for April 2. What a joyful privilege to participate in this world-wide witness! Where capable brothers are lacking, arrangements should be made with another congregation for a speaker. These arrangements and the ordering of handbills should be cared for right away. To save shipping expense, please submit both the Memorial invitation order’ and the special-talk handbill order at the same time, but on separate order blanks.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Public meetings serve an important part in the world-wide expansion of God’s organization. For those already studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, public meetings serve to impress on their minds vital Kingdom truths and expand their knowledge. For those who do not now study, public meetings tend to awaken their interest in having a home Bible study. In addition Jehovah’s witnesses receive great benefit themselves, for they learn new ideas and ways of expressing Kingdom truths. Being so important, public meetings should be of the best quality possible. This requires good speakers that are well prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Who should be used as public speakers? All overseers and appointed servants should apply themselves to qualify as speakers. Other brothers can also be used if they meet the requirements. All brothers selected should be well versed in the truth and able to give talks that are both interesting and instructive. Some things to look for in public speakers are: Does he follow the Society’s outline? Will he set forth a clear theme that is easy to understand? Is he enthusiastic? Does he employ teaching methods in speaking? (See February, 1960, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span><span class="font10"> Other qualifications are set forth in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity,</span><span class="font10"> paragraph 134.

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Is Special Pioneering for You?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Special pioneers are specialists in the ministry. They go out into isolated territories, open up new fields, establish new congregations and strengthen weak ones. After a congregation is well established or after a weak congregation is made strong, the special pioneer moves on to new fields to develop and organize other congregations. As a group they have done an excellent job and their fruits show it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Before ascending </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> heaven, Jesus told his close followers: “You will be witnesses of me ... to the most distant part of the earth.” Obviously Jesus foresaw the time when some dedicated men and women would leave their fathers and mothers, their friends and families to preach the good news in unknown places and isolated territories. Many special pioneers have done just that. Other special pioneers have remained in their own country. Familial' with the customs and habits of their people, knowing how to buy, eat and live in their own land, they are able to be of immediate loving service to those hungering for truth and righteousness.—Acts 1: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In the United States in the last two years, the special pioneers have worked hard and have reaped marvelous results. They have started forty-four congregations in unassigned territories! Well done indeed! Press on in this work!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> During the last service </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">year </span><span class="font10">there were, on an average, 474 special pioneers in the United States. The door is wide open for many more. To qualify for the monthly allowance the special pioneer requirements are only 150 hours, a month in the field ministry, plus 50 back-calls. To meet the special pioneer requirements you must have a good ministerial service record. You must be stole to read, write, start Bible studies and organize congregations. Do you meet these requirements? Are you willing to go wherever the Society needs special pioneers? Then write to the Society and state your wish to be a special pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> There are 259 isolated-publisher groups that could be organized into congregations right now with a little mature assistance. Pioneers and publishers who desire to serve in isolated groups and thus help out, please inform the Society as to the part of the country to which you prefer to go. The need is great in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The call is out for more special pioneers. Do you hear the call ? How will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font10"> respond ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On Subscription Expiration Calls</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> At this time of the year many subscription expiration slips are being sent to the congregations. How should these be viewed? As a splendid source of new subscriptions I Alert to the value of the magazines ourselves, naturally we want to make these calls most productive. How can this be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First of all, the call should be made immediately on receipt of the slip. These people are acquainted with the magazine; at least they have been receiving it. However, they may not have read it recently, so we have to rekindle the interest by giving a sermon and then directing the person to something specific in the magazine that will help him to realize its importance. To initiate the call use a warm, friendly greeting. You might say: “Good morning, I represent the publishers of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> (or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!) </span><span class="font10">magazine. [Pause briefly here; you may be invited inside.] We are quite concerned with the world situation and man’s future in the space age, and I know you are too. So much lias been said lately about this matter, but we wonder -what God’s Word</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A New Peak</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What joy is ours to have had 252,097 ministers in the field praising Jehovah during December I This represents a new peak in publishers, 19,465 more ministers in active service, or an 8.4-percent increase in the United States over last year’s average. All together, they placed 3,633,525 magazines, made 966,926 back-calls and conducted 1^,044 home Bible studies during December. What joy this must bring to Jehovah God and to all the holy angels to see persons turning away from the old world of death to the new world of life by praising the great Life-giver!—Luke 15: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Our working together in unity, according to Jehovah's will and purpose, has brought about this blessing from Jehovah. As the apostle Paul stated: &quot;I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” Now by example we must teach them that regularity in the field ministry is the way to maturity. says about it. It is encouraging first of all to learn that man was created to live on earth, not in space.” Then give the sermon “Man’s Future in This Space Age.” On completion of the sermon, or whatever portion of it you are able to give, refer to a specific article or point that would vitally interest the householder and then say: “Interesting articles like this are coming in every issue and I would not want you to miss this valuable information. I have received notice that your subscription has recently expired and would certainly like to see you renew it. It will be a pleasure for me to send it in for you.”</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If the offer is not accepted, then at least offer the householder the two latest magazines for ten cents, and, depending upon the reaction, you can discern whether or not it would be advisable to try to get a subscription at a. later date.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The main thing is to be confident, not apologetic. Clearly, our mission is to help the subscriber to appraise the journal intelligently as one of utmost spiritual value. Then he will be motivated to read the magazirle and learn of Jehovah’s ways, which lead to life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>an Publishers!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our desire is that these new ministers be the right kind of ministers. And they will be if we set the right example for them. If we let other interests keep us away from magazine service at the time we ha ve scheduled for it, if w sleep in Sunday mornings instead of sharing in the service, if we miss meetings for no good reason, then that is what they will do. They will copy our example whether good or bad. So encourage them by setting a right example in the ministry, putting forth an extra effort for their sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Help these new ones to be efficient in every feature of the service. This takes time—sometimes many months, even years. Jesus spent three years with his apostles teaching and training them. Train these with equal thoroughness. Be good examples to the growing flock of God.</span></p>

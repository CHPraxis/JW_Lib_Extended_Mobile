<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Maintain Peace to Bear Fruit</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Unlike the old world, true Christians are not divided by nationalism, racial strife, social distinctions or family squabbles. Having Jehovah as their teacher, they are at peace. They earnestly endeavor to apply Bible principles so as to maintain peace within the Christian congregation, and as witnesses for Jehovah they are “making peace to be heard.” —Isa. 54:13; 52: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Congregations that are participating in unassigned-territory work can reflect the fruitage of peace by good organization and wholehearted co-operation. There is much to be done, and all will want to spend as much time as possible in this service so that an extensive witness can be given. When interest is found, lovingly take time to demonstrate how to study the publications with the Bible. If at all possible, call back to continue the study. If the distance is too great, arrange for qualified publishers—perhaps some who are infirm—to correspond with these newly interested ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If there is no unassigned territory within reach of your congregation, servants will analyze the congregation’s territory and concentrate efforts on the least-worked sections. Emphasize calling on not-at-homes and following up on all interest, to assure thorough coverage of the assignment. See to it that everyone in your territory hears the message of peace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> All can help to maintain peace by showing consideration as to service arrangements. Out of thoughtfulness for the others in your service group, as well as for the sake of receiving the counsel needed for effectiveness in your own ministry, make it a habit to be on time at meetings for field service. After the meeting is dismissed, conserve time by leaving promptly for the territory. If you are in charge of a service group, be sure that each one has enough territory to work during the entire period he plans to engage in house-to-house work so no time is lost in waiting for another assignment. The most can usually be accomplished if each one works alone at the doors, unless training is being given. Show your Christian maturity by being willing to do this. Yes, all can contribute to peaceable, efficient service arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Through his organization, Jehovah has marvelously equipped us for the ministry. The sermon “Does God Really Care?” enables us to direct the attention of interested ones to His loving provisions for a peaceful new world. Use it, and others as appropriate. Patiently help those you meet to understand God’s way. Even if they are not interested, maintain peace by being kind, demonstrating both by words and deeds that the message really is one of peace. On every occasion possible</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Are you regularly in attendance at all congregation meetings? If so, do you help someone else to attend? Are you among those who can say, “Yes,” to these questions? The records show that about 22 percent do not attend the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and 33 percent do not attend the service meeting and ministry school.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Based on the April peak of 273,131 publishers, this means there are, on the average, 59,000 to 90,000 publishers who are missing out on much life-giving teaching and are not regularly having loving, upbuilding association with their brothers at these spiritual feasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Various causes can be cited for offer the latest bound book you have in stock and a booklet. Having different publishers demonstrate the current sermon and the offer when the group meets in the morning for service has proved to be a great aid in getting everyone off to a good start; so book study conductors should continue to arrange for this.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Bear in mind that August is the last month of the service year. Be sure to mail your report to your home congregation in ample time if you are away. Wherever you are, let the message of peace be heard.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Whether at meetings or in the service, at home or at work, bear fruit; let the peaceful fruitage of God’s spirit be manifest in all you do. As Jesus said: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.”—John 15 : 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">this irregular attendance. Some have allowed secular interests, worldly pleasures and other distractions to interfere, while ill health prevents attendance from time to time. Still others have transportation problems. Servants and mature brothers who realize the value of meetings can do much to help build up a desire for spiritual things through Scriptural discussions with those not regularly attending meetings. Also, they can and will want to assist others in practical ways to overcome their transportation problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Undoubtedly much can be worked out in a practical way through the service centers. Congregation book study conductors can ascertain the problems of the ones in their service centers. Encouragement can be given those who have cars to pick up those who would otherwise be unable to attend. Many who are elderly can be helped in this way, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">(7 min.) Chairman reads first scripture, asks audience what points in scripture could be used to emphasize theme. How could these points be tactfully drawn out by publisher?

<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Well-prepared publisher demonstrates use of sermon from “Good News” booklet as householder looks up texts in own Bible. All encouraged to follow along and take notes. You might say, “On my previous visit I enjoyed my Bible discussion with you emphasizing how God is keenly interested in what is going on in the world today and will shortly do something about all the wickedness. Knowing that you too are interested in seeing the time when his will is done on earth, I’ve been looking forward to sharing more information with you on just how conditions will be changed. One of the outstanding scriptures we talked about was the one at Psalm 72. Perhaps you noticed the comment made on that text in the booklet 1 left you. [Pause for householder’s comment.] If you would like to get your copy of the booklet with your Bible, I’m sure you’ll enjoy what the Bible shows will shortly take place.” (Ask to step inside if appropriate.) Publisher may use questions on paragraphs to stimulate thinking of student.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman interrupts, explaining publisher might continue for several paragraphs, depending on circumstances, but now notice how way is prepared to continue study on the next call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Publisher briefly reviews good things learned. Commends householder for comments and makes definite arrangement to return and continue discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman stresses simplicity of back-call work, encourages all to have part. Increased back-call work brings increase in Bible studies and praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on witnessing with magazines, based on “Yearbook” experiences. See pages 201, 203, 232, 254, 269.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article “Ordering Magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">22 min: Effect of Magazine Activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Magazine, activity lays foundation for expansion. It stirs up interest, overcomes prejudice, publicizes Kingdom message. Appreciating its purpose and benefits helps us to be more diligent in magazine activity. What can magazines do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (3 min.) Wife has just returned from shopping. Husband finds handbill in shopping bag, is surprised wife accepted it. Wife feels Witnesses do good work, likes reading literature. Husband wants no fanatic trying to convert or sell religion to him. Wife disagrees; they are friendly, always have something interesting to say. She forgot something at the store. Husband volunteers to get it, as he has to go to his brother’s home anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (3 min.) As husband enters door, Witness approaches manager with magazines. He listens unobtrusively, is surprised when manager warmly accepts magazines. After Witness leaves he mildly expresses surprise to manager, who replies that, while he has his own religion, he always takes the magazines. Likes variety of profitable articles. Commends witnesses for sincerity and zeal. Husband, deep in thought, leaves store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE HI (2 min.) As husband slowly walks down street he observes Witness tactfully approaching window-shopper. Brief, kind, tactful presentation made, person accepts magazines. Husband, who had slotved down to hear, thoughtfully walks on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE IV (3 min.) At his brother’s home their conversation interrupted by Witness calling. Brother answers door, husband listens with interest. Brother accepts magazines, tells husband he always takes and enjoys reading them, commends ministry of Witnesses. Husband glances through magazines, comments on interesting title, but must leave</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE V (5 min.) Husband has just arrived home when a Witness calls. Wife answers door. Husband interrupts, tells Witness they have been following him all day. Inquires about the work, why they call, purpose of magazines, etc. Publisher kindly and tactfully explains, makes brief magazine presentation, husband accepts. Publisher offers to return, husband welcomes offer. After Witness leaves, husband (&quot;whose attitude has changed) expresses how impressed he was by sincerity, zeal and friendliness. Not fanatics as he had thought. Each Witness had .something interesting to say; other religions could learn from Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Effects of magazine work often not directly seen by us. It prepares &quot;way for acceptance of message. The more frequently the territory is worked, the more the interest is found. Be positive, enthusiastic, but do not high-pressure or force magazines. Be kind, tactful. Start magazine routes. Make back-calls on persons who show special interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4, based on Zeph. 2:3.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher at Meetings for Field Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s servants are always alert to ‘buy out the opportune time’ to teach. A golden opportunity for instructing our brothers is at the meetings for field service. In a year a regular Kingdom publisher spends many hours at these meetings. Since what is learned there can be immediately passed on to many others in the territory, what an appropriate time it is to teach!—Eph. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">5:</span><span class="font11">16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> This grand opportunity to teach can so easily be lost by lack of preparation. So whet the appetite of your brothers in advance. Let them know what they can do to prepare. Encourage them to be there and on time by showing them that this is an opportunity provided by Jehovah to be taught by Him. When they arrive, give them a warm welcome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The possibilities for teaching at meetings for service are almost limitless. Publishers assigned well in advance may demonstrate the current sermon. Where weaknesses have been noted in these sermons, demonstrations may be arranged and presented so as to emphasize how improvement can be made. Objections commonly met in your territory should be considered. The various essentials for effective sermons found in the September, 1957, to November, 1958, issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> may be discussed. A week or two might be spent on each essential. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Enthusiasm on the part of the one in charge</span><span class="font11"> and a variety of approaches that draw all the publishers into the discussion are required for stimulating and instructive meetings for service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> At meetings for magazine service the essentials for good magazine presentations found in the April, 1960, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> may be reviewed. Talking points from the current magazines may also be discussed, and demonstrations prepared in advance may be used to illustrate how these can be used in the field. Experiences that illustrate a good point or principle of presentation might be shared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A morning meeting for service should begin with a brief discussion of the daily text, drawing out comments that apply the text to the circumstances and ministry of those in the group, and before departing for the field service Jehovah’s direction should be petitioned. The entire morning program should not exceed fifteen minutes. Meetings for service at other times should be cut considerably shorter by dispensing with the discussion of the text.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Will you pray for me?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Quite often sincerely religious people ask the question, “Will you pray for me?” Under these circumstances what should we do? Would it be proper? What view should we take of such requests?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> First of all, it is good to realize what prayer is. Knowing this puts us in the best position to handle matters properly. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font11"> defines true prayer as “an earnest petition, offered to the right one, in the right manner, and on right matters.” To illustrate how these principles guiding true prayer work, suppose the householder seriously asks, “Since you are a minister, will you come in and pray for my mother; she is quite ill?” When confronted with this question it would be good to approach the situation calmly. After entering the house you might say, “I’m sorry to hear that your mother is so ill and I appreciate your request for prayer. When prayer is mentioned we often call to mind the model prayer of Jesus. Remember how he prayed on that occasion. First of all, he directed his prayer to ‘Our Father.’ Psalm 83:18 establishes the Most High God Jehovah as our heavenly</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Actual-count inventory of literature is to be taken by all congregations on September 1. Two literature inventory forms are being sent to each congregation with the statement..

If you have not yet attended one of the United Worshipers District Assemblies, by all means be present at one of these for all six days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ United Worshipers District Assemblies will also be held at Anchorage, Alaska, August 24-27, and in Bermuda, September 14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Congregations that will be attending district assemblies in August and September should remember that at least a half hour on the service meeting program following the assembly is to be devoted to a review and practical discussion of things learned at the assembly and encouraging experiences. This should be carefully planned by the congregation servant in advance. Any</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and all publishers prepare well, the time spent at meetings for field service will result in improved efficiency, fruitfulness and spiritual vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Father. Then Christ Jesus prayed for the Kingdom as the remedy for all the ills of mankind. This is pointed oiit at Revelation 21: 4: ‘And he will wipe out every tear from theii- eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.’ ” Then proceed to show that it is only under God’s kingdom that sickness, sin and death will be abolished, and how comforting it is now to have such a hope. (This may satisfy the person’s need for comfort.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If the householder requests prayer after this explanation, then you could proceed to pray for God’s kingdom and an accurate knowledge and understanding of his will. While not praying directly for the individual, we would be praying for God’s kingdom, which is the answer to all mankind’s problems. It would not be possible for us to pray for miraculous healing or for better conditions under this system of things. The Bible clearly points out the power of prayer and the good that it can accomplish. By handling calls in this way we can turn such occasions into a witness for the kingdom and utilize the avenue of prayer to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ordering Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some congregations find it difficult to maintain an ample, but not excessive, supply of magazines. When too few are ordered, the publishers do not have enough. At other times the magazines accumulate and the account with the Society becomes delinquent. How should the order for distributors’ copies be made up?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Rather than simply estimating the congregation’s magazine requirements, the magazine-territory servant should check with each publisher and pioneer to ascertain their regular needs. Perhaps a publisher wants four copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each issue</span><span class="font11"> of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and four copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each issue</span><span class="font11"> of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!;</span><span class="font11"> the servant will make a note of the publisher’s, name and the quantity of each issue desired. To determine how many magazines the congregation should order, simply add up the individual orders submitted. For ordering, the congregation servant should use the magazine Distributors’ Order blank; ordering, if possible, each magazine in tens for orders of thirty or more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Each publisher should recognize that when he places an order for a regular- supply of magazines, those magazines become his responsibility, not that of the congregation. If you still have on hand magazines of previous issues, do not tell the magazineterritory servant that you do not want the new supply; they are yours, obtained at your request. Likewise, if you are going to be away from the congregation for a week or for several weeks, perhaps on a trip, remember that your magazines will continue to come through for you at the Kingdom Hall, just as other mail accumulates at your home. And even if you should move away on short notice, accept the responsibility for your supply of magazines until such time as the cancellation of your order goes into effect with the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In order to place all the magazines you order, a schedule is important. If you have a specific time set aside for magazine work and share in it regularly, if you always offer the magazines when the regular literature offer is not accepted, if you are using them on your back-calls and in incidental witnessing, the magazines will not accumulate. Even if you should not be able to share in the service as fully as usual for a short time owing to unforeseen circumstances, resourcefulness on your part will make it possible to place your magazines. Offer them to those who call at your home. Look at the titles of the articles and consider who there is in your community that would be particularly interested in those articles and make an effort to get the magazines to those persons. If, after considering your own possibilities for placing the magazines, you feel that it still will not be possible to use all of a particular issue, while they are still current tell the magazineterritory servant that you have extras, and then if a new publisher who does not yet have an order asks for magazines or some other publisher finds that he is placing more than usual of that particular issue and asks for more, the magazine-territory servant can suggest that he see you to get copies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> On certain occasions one knows that he will be able to use an extra supply of magazines; for example, to vacation pioneer, for special activity during the week of the circuit servant’s visit and on worldly holidays, also when one of the magazines carries advance notice of an article that will go well in a particular territory. In these cases place an order with the magazine-territory servant </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">as early as possible</span><span class="font11"> for extra copies of the particular issue or Issues that you will need, and the congregation can place a special order with the Society for these issues without changing your regular order for each issue. It is very important that all special orders and changes in order be handled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">promptly</span><span class="font11"> by the servants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If for some reason you find that older magazines have accumulated, do not destroy them; they contain information that can lead persons to life. While we distribute only magazines of recent issue from house to house, some have had excellent results in visiting hospitals, city, county, or state poor farms and old-age homes and, as ministers, with the permission of the ones in charge, talking to the patients and leaving free copies of these upbuilding Bible journals with those who will read them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> A tremendous witness is being given through the use of the magazines. Plan carefully to be sure that you have the supplies that are needed and that all magazines received are used effectively in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Attend Meetings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Coni’tZ)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as well as those who have families and who may not be financially able to bring them to the meetings regularly. True, such might require leaving a little earlier than usual or may mean additional expense. Nonetheless, the value of the spiritual nourishment gained will more than offset the cost.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> On the other hand, those aided can express their appreciation for such kindness by word and deed. Saying, “Thank you,” means much. Also, a reasonable contribution toward gas and oil reflects a grateful spirit for being assisted to attend meetings and when taken in field service. An unused auto ashtray provides a convenient, unobtrusive place for leaving such contributions. When arrangements are made for some to be picked up, those riding should be ready on time, so no time is lost and the group does not arrive late at the Kingdom Hall. Good scheduling and co-operation will be in the best Interests of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Your loving display of hospitality toward one another will mean more regular attendance at the meetings and thus greater maturity for the entire congregation.</span></p>

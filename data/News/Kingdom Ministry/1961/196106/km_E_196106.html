<p><span class="font9">Watch Yourself to Do Right Works</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> You were called not only to preach Christianity, but to live it as well. This calls for doing right works. Therefore, Peter exhorted the brothers to “put away all moral badness and all deceitfulness and hypocrisy and envies and all kinds of backbiting.” He urged them to maintain their conduct right among the nations, “that, in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers, they may as a result of your right works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.” So it is to the glory of God and to our own salvation that we watch ourselves to do right works.—1 Pet. 2:1, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We are obliged not only to watch ourselves that we do right works, but to teach others how to order their lives to the glory of God. Continue to use the sermon “What Is Your Hope?” as a means to that end. And what better way is there to teach than through the home Bible study arrangement with the use of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> book? Brothers in the United States have been doing excellently in starting studies—199,201 of them are being conducted at present. Knowing the good that is derived from these studies, let us endeavor to start as many of them as we possibly can. Every </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> placement is a potential study. Many studies are started on the initial call. If you cannot start one then, try by making a return visit and by using the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> back-call sermon. Let us watch ourselves by helping others do right works by means of the study arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some brothers are more efficient than others at starting studies. These might offer to take with them brothers who do not have studies. Let them observe your method of approach and manner of instructing. Train them to take over the study while you move on to start others. By the end of June every publisher should try to have at least one home Bible study going. When holding a study with a member of a family, try to get others of the family to sit in. Invite the husband, the wife and the children to take part. Neglect no one. Teach all to be active and productive in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Many parents have not, as yet, started a regular Bible study in their own home. This should be done. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> March 13, 1961, page 174) If you wish to report the study and the time that you spend holding a regular home Bible study with an undedicated member of the family, you may do so. Many of our younger brothers and sisters are-conducting studies with their school friends and playmates, using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font12"> book. And a number conduct studies with adults too. How are your children doing? Teach them to do right works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> June is an excellent time not only to hold Bible studies, but also to do magazine work. Arrangements should be made for- midweek meetings for field service and also let all service center groups arrange for</span></p>

A service center group in Missouri says that working about an hour on the way to the study results in placing from ten to twelve magazines per publisher each time. Have you tried this? You should. Those who like to do street witnessing should take the initiative to approach people that are passing by or those waiting for the buses. Also, many brothers are having good success working from car to car in shopping centers. Watch your work with the magazines. Do good work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Theme: Watching- Ourselves to Do Right Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on “Watching Ourselves to Do Right Works.” (See “Watchtower,” August 15, 1960, pp. 497-508, and June 1, 1961, p. 350.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Watch Yourself to Do Right Works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font11"> min; “Paradise Hope” Back-Call Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (10 min.). “Paradise” book grand instrument for revealing truth to new ones. Should follow up all placements in order to stimulate interest further. Return with positive attitude that study can be started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Discusses sermon with audience as they follow along in their books. First, shows importance of friendly greeting and recalling theme of earthly paradise hope previously discussed. Householder may be invited to read texts from Bible. Discusses how scriptures and illustrations follow logical sequence, allowing audience to suggest transitions. Stresses need for simplicity. Emphasizes importance of following through to start study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Heavenly hope for little flock (Luke 12:32—page 216, par. 23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Other sheep have earthly hope (John 10:16—page 216, par. 23)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Rev. 21:2-4—page 219, par. 31) Promises can be trusted</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Page 219, par. 32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PUBLISHER (10 min.) Mature publisher will demonstrate use of sermon. Calls on householder with friendly greeting, happy to return to share additional thoughts on Paradise hope previously discussed. Scriptures previously considered showed that heavenly and earthly hope would be enjoyed by two classes. (Opens book to page 216, par. 23.) Heavenly hope open to “little flock,” as shown in Luke 12:32. How many comprise this group? Limited to 144,000. (Help them if they forgot.) Great majority of faithful mankind are “other sheep,” not of this fold. (John 10:16, par. 23) These have been promised eternal life on a paradise earth. Fear and distress now experienced will end under righteous rule of Christ Jesus and faithful princes. (Isa. 32:1, par. 25) Illustration (page 217) depicts peaceful conditions to be enjoyed by happy families who display loving care for paradise home. As a result of Jehovah’s blessing, perfected mankind will rejoice to see pain and sorrow vanish. (Rev. 21:2-4, par. 31) Although seemingly impossible, we can trust in these promises. (Par. 32) How can this wonderful blessing be received? Must learn what God requires of us by a careful examination of his purposes. This book is designed for that very purpose; it can help us appreciate why man and the earth were made and what God will do to restore perfect paradise first enjoyed by man. “What does paradise mean to you?” (Allows for comment while turning to page 9, par. 1.) “Notice how it’s described here as a garden or park where peace is enjoyed by happy inhabitants.” (Demonstrates paragraphs as time allows, then makes arrangements for return call when more can be considered.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Every publisher can use this simple but effective back-call sermon. Follow up every placement with positive goal in mind to start study. Make return visit within a week. Strive to start and regularly conduct at least one study in this book. With mature ones assisting the less experienced, every publisher can share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 1, based on Mark 13:37, and article dealing with April activity and Memorial report.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">22 min: How to Take Notes and Use Them. (Each publisher encouraged to prepare for this part by carefully reading information on page 20, February 8, 1959, “Awake!”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(School servant will assign in advance several publishers—father, mother, youth and pioneer, if possible—to take notes on instruction talk [select good speaker] given this evening for later discussion on service meeting. Invite all attending to take notes, briefly explaining what will follow on the service meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) District assemblies approaching. Taking notes will be valuable, improves ministry, often causes one to listen more intently, helps one to concentrate on speaker’s key ideas, aids in review of material and enables one to be in better position to share information with others. Briefly discuss merit of taking notes, with following points in mind: (These may be put on chart for all to see.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Take notes moderately; express complete thought</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Use selectivity and evaluation</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">4. Put down in own words when possible</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">(6 min.) Servant calls publishers to come before audience with their notes, which are discussed with above four points in mind. If time allows, audience may be invited to relate points on which they made notes and tell why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) Servant summarizes coverage of discussion and the value of having these four basic points in mind when taking notes. How can notes be valuably used in addition to personal review? Asks one of selected publishers to use notes taken on instruction talk to share information with a publisher who did not attend school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Publisher uses notes to share material. Gives model presentation, employing teaching method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(4 min.) School servant points out that publisher might not have shared so much with his brother had he not taken notes. Note-taking is helpful because (1) it often aids one to concentrate, understand and retain more, and (2) the notes<sup>-</sup> may assist one to share the information more fully and effectively with another. Urge all to re-examine February 8, 1959, “Awake!,” page 20, before going to assemblies. Encourage publishers to pay close attention at the assemblies and to take notes that will be helpful to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Loving talk on “No Summer Letup This Year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4, based on Zech. 14:8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No Summer Letup This Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do spiritual values change with the change of season? No I The glorious treasure of service is constant, one of the most valued possessions we have. While summer months mean vacation and recreation, will we let this activity crowd out our service to Jehovah? No indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In 1960 there was a summer letdown in service, as we averaged 9.6 hours a month for the three-month period of July through September. However, in 19S9 the three-month average was 10.4 hours a month. If the publishers who were in the field these three months of 1960 had averaged 10.4 hours a month, this would have amounted to over a half million more hours of preaching. Think of the good that could have been done to aid people of good will with this time! What can we do to avoid a summer letdown this year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Families making arrangements for summer vacations should include definite arrangements for every member of the family to be in the field, striving for at least ten hours a month. Parents will get great pleasure from working with and getting close to their children and their service problems. Long evenings, vacation periods, weekends and midweek witnessing, open to all congregations, will afford excellent opportunities for parents to continue this close theocratic association with their children and enjoy wholesome fellowship while they are training them to be effective ministers. Many parents will be able to vacation pioneer with their children. These things will work to improve family togetherness as well as increase praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Summer plans will also include travel to and from one of the assemblies, and this too affords many opportunities for witnessing. Go prepared for this. Make opportunities by taking the initiative to talk to others. Make your attendance at the assembly complete and more enjoyable by sharing in the field service at the assembly city.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Then, too, let us avoid a spiritual summer letdown in meeting attendance; regularly attend all meetings. Even if vacationing away from your congregation, you will enjoy meeting with your brothers wherever you are. Remember, Jehovah’s command to assemble together does not change with the season.—Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Finally, do not forget to report your activity. If away from the congregation, mail it to the congregation servant. Let each one be keenly interested in maintaining his service to Jehovah. There will be no</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Properly Handling Magazine Routes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In the April and May issues of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry</span><span class="font12"> much information was given with regard to developing magazine routes. Many are the publishers who are now placing more magazines than ever before. Do you as yet have a route?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Remember, only five simple points need to be noted on your House-to-House Record to lay the basis for a successful route. They are: (1) householder’s name, (2) address, (3) date of visit, (4) issues placed, (5) article featured. Make your deliveries every other w<sup>T</sup>eek; then work new magazine territory and make additions to your route. Some will be dropped, but new ones will be added. What can result? In one congregation in Kansas, the circuit servant stressed the development of routes. Only ten were then making the magazine quota, but six months later, mainly due to magazine routes, 21 were making it. Parents started these routes, took their children along until such were firmly established, and in some cases then turned the routes over to the children. In another case in Washington state, a brother increased his magazine placements from 30 a month to 60 to 80 magazines by means of developing a route. Have </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font12"> started a route yet?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> To get the best results this work must be carried on systematically.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Offer for ~ July—September : “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” and a booklet, for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ All baptized publishers who have reported regularly for the last six months and who can arrange to do so are encouraged to vacation pioneer this summer. Obtain your application right away and turn it over to the congregation servant for attention by the committee and forwarding to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ The week after your congregation attends the United Worshipers District Assembly, devote at least half an hour on the service meeting to a review and practical discussion of things learned at the assembly and encouraging experiences that were related, taking care to highlight the matters that need particular attention in your own congregation. This should be carefully planned by the congregation servant in advance. Make whatever adjustments are necessary in the service meeting schedule in order to put on this special program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ Thus far 197 applications for unassigned territory have been received. This is good to see, but it leaves over</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">In this connection it has been asked: What will occur when a route has been developed in a certain territory and the publisher turns in the territory? Must we hold the territory in order to continue the route? Since our purpose is to feed the sheep, we should continue to make the deliveries until someone is assigned the territory and is willing to assume the responsibility for the route. How will we know when the territory is reassigned? If a territory is turned in and a route has been developed in this territory, the magazine-territory servant will note this and encourage the publisher who held the territory to keep on making the deliveries until the territory is reassigned. When that territory is assigned to another publisher, the magazine-territory servant will get the publisher who has developed the route together with the publisher now assigned the territory, and arrangements for handling the route will be made. Preferably the one now holding the territory should assume this responsibility. If, for some reason, he cannot do this, then perhaps the publisher who developed the route can keep on making the deliveries until the one taking out the territory can. In this way the magazineterritory servant will be promoting magazine-route activity, will be cognizant of such developments in the congregation, and good organization will prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">800 territories unassigned. Congregations and publishers, if at all possible, share in this special activity. Send in your application right away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When the regular literature offer is not taken, we have been counseled to offer two magazines. Many are doing this with excellent results. They report that they seldom end service without having placed at least a few magazines. Always try to leave a handbill whether literature is taken or not, and often where other literature is not taken a tract may be given, especially where the householder has expressed interest in a subject covered by one of the tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For example, if a person is a churchgoer or interested in the Bible or perhaps may question its inspiration, the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">How Valuable Is the Bible?</span><span class="font12"> may be left. Or someone may express the thought that we are a Communist group; their objection or misunderstanding can be answered by the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Witnesses, Communists or Christians?</span><span class="font12"> Sometimes we contact a person who has just experienced the death of a loved one. The tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Hope for the Dead </span><span class="font12">may be offered as a source of comfort. It is well to be prepared with tracts to meet these various situations that arise. When persons are not at home, sometimes publishers</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> United Worshipers District Assemblies begin this month. Are your plans made? If not, we suggest that you make arrangements as soon as possible. Particularly should you send in your. Room Request form immediately if you are attending a June assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In your arrangements be sure to include the entire six days of the assembly. When we travel many miles and spend considerable money to get to the convention city, we should take full advantage of it by being there for the first session on Tuesday and staying until the conclusion on Sunday.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Since Jehovah provides so bountifully for us, it would be well, to be just as generous to the people in the convention city by sharing in the field service during the mornings of the assembly when no meetings are scheduled. In this connection, may wish to leave a tract, but this is usually done only if the territory will not be covered again soon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The question has been asked, “Would it ever be proper to leave magazines when people are not home?” We do not want to indiscriminately give away magazines, but there may be times when a territory is not worked often, and will not be worked again soon, where a publisher may wish to leave an older copy of one of the magazines when people are not home. This can be left to the discretion of the publisher working the territory. Publishers should keep in mind that the best way is to place magazines in the usual manner by contacting the people personally and offering the magazines for a contribution. To leave them at homes without contacting the persons or indiscriminately giving them away free can create problems. Therefore, leaving them when people are not at home should be the exception, not the general practice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When the regular offer is not taken, magazines and tracts may effectively be used. Carry them with you at all times when you are in the service, and take advantage of all other opportunities to use them too.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There is a word of caution that we would like to mention in conjunction with attending the assemblies this summer. At all times when your car is parked be sure that it is parked in accordance with prescribed legal requirements. Then, too, whenever you leave your car be sure it is locked. In addition to this, never leave anything showing in the car, because thieves are so likely to break in and steal. Instead, put it in the trunk and lock it. Then it will be out of sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By being present at the United Worshipers District Assemblies we will be able to manifest the united spirit that is common only among Jehovah’s witnesses and no other people. Our hearts will be overflowing with good things that Jehovah has in store for all of us spiritually, and then, too, we have special opportunity of bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name and bringing honor to it.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">it would be well to obtain your territory in advance, that is, the night before, so you may go directly to your assignment in the morning. In all cases have a territory in which to work, be it door-to-door, streetmagazine or<sup>-</sup> placard work. The current literature offer for the month will be used, also the regular magazine offer. Bear in mind, too, you can be of great assistance to the householders where you stay. Above all things, you will want to invite them to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> While in attendance at the convention we should remember that we are a theatrical spectacle to people and are under careful scrutiny.

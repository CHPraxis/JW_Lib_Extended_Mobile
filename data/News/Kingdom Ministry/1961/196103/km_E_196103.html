<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Copy the Master's Manner of Teaching</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How productive is the ministry of those who copy the Master’s manner of teaching! This was certain to be so, because “everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” This is an important month for applying the Master’s manner of teaching in all aspects of our ministry, for March is Memorial month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Last year the Memorial attendance for the United States was 434,-795—an increase of 79,812 over the attendance at Memorial in 1959. May we work just as diligently this year in inviting others to attend the Memorial, March 30, after 6 p.m. Start using the Memorial invitations about the middle of the month. An invitation should be given to all with whom Bible studies are being conducted, persons on whom back-calls are being made and any subscribers for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines, friends, relatives and others who would be interested in attending. By our diligence in inviting good-will persons to the Memorial, March should be one of the finest back-call months on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Though the back-call work will play a big role in our month’s activity, spend some time every week in. the house-to-house ministry. During December the average hours for congregation publishers dropped to nine. Let us do our utmost to build this average up to at least ten hours per publisher. How? Try to be out in the field ministry each Sunday, spending at least two hours in the house-to-house ministry whenever possible and one hour in the back-call work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> How are you doing in the subscription campaign? By the first of March, to be abreast with the suggested quota, all publishers should have obtained at least one subscription, pioneers ten, and special pioneers 15. Continue to be subscription-minded. Do not pass up any opportunity to obtain a subscription. That many are happy to subscribe is apparent from the numerous subscriptions flowing into the Society’s office day after day. An interesting letter was received: “Herewith find $2 for my subscription to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for two years. Somehow 1 missed anyone calling on me to see if I wanted it, which I surely do, as I very much enjoy reading it. It is reading of the very best. I wish I knew when the services were here so I could attend.” A good-will slip was sent to the congregation so a publisher could call on this person. Such a letter emphasizes the need for regularly sharing in the house-to-house</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Memorial Activity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Special efforts in our Kingdom ministry! When do they begin? With the Memorial and with our helping all good-will persons to attend. Make a list of all those you intend to invite to the Memorial. Follow through on it. Because of the important events after the Memorial, all congregations will hold a service meeting that week, but it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MARCH ‘Watchtower” subscription for one year and three booklets, for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR MARCH Copying the Master’s Manner of Teaching.—Luke 6:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">should not interfere with the Memorial celebration. Congregations normally having their service meeting on Thursday can arrange to have it on another night. Friday, March 31, may be the most suitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Special arrangements for the field ministry: Each congregation should make its own schedule in accord with local circumstances. All publishers who possibly can get out ministry and for calling back when householders are not at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Put forth reasonable effort to give householders the current sermon. Reports from all over the country tell of the excellent reception on the part of householders of the sermon “Man’s Future in This Space Age.” A brother writes: “I wanted to write you relative to the success we have been having with the new sermon. In two territories the average was one subscription in every three households. The new sermon is just the thing needed to arouse the interest of many sheeplike persons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> When subscriptions are obtained, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">into the field ministry should try to do so on Memorial day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Witnessing on Sunday will be through the service centers, enabling the most to be out and the greatest aid to be rendered to new and less mature ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> After Memorial give special attention to those persons Invited but who did not attend. Extend to them an invitation to attend the special public talk. At the close of the talk the special April 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">will be released for immediate distribution. Our big work after the special talk will be the helping of good-will persons to share in the Kingdom ministry, using the special magazine to be released at the public talk. Follow up with encouragement during the whole of April. The April 22 special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will have a novel approach, one that should appeal to persons of many faiths and thus prove a most fitting companion to the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">featuring the article “The Sacred Bible and Our Problem of Survival.” Be ready, then, for the special Memorial activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font9"> min: Building Up New Ones for Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Do we want new ones to share in the ministry with us in April? Then we must begin now to prepare them progressively for this activity. For the next three weeks, after each home Bible study, have something prepared to turn the student’s mind toward privileges of service. How? Watch the groundwork being laid on the first of these calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (5 min.) After the study, conductor commends student for progress, asks how he would explain God’s purpose for this earth if neighbors or friends inquired. Student relates truths learned and quotes Matt. 6:9, 10 when proof is asked. Publisher encourages him to watch for opportunities to tell others good things learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) This encouragement to participate can be used for those who have been studying only a short time. Now, what can be done the very next week to encourage the same person toward sharing in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (5 min.) As study concludes, publisher speaks of most important event of year for Christians, offering handbill with invitation to Memorial. Mentions special public meeting to be held in over 21,000 congregations. Using “Kingdom Ministry,” outlines congregation service arrangements starting with Memorial; many persons being studied with will want to share. Publisher builds up benefit and joy all will have who do share in the ministry. (Some may be ready for service at this point. If so, make arrangements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Now, with foundation laid, watch how “Yearbook” can serve as basis to encourage new ones into service the third week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (5 min.) Publisher uses “Yearbook” to point out preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in 179 lands. Explains it is filled with enjoyable experiences; over 47,000 new ones joined in taking truths to others last year; reads and discusses joy new one had in service for first time. (“Yearbook,” page 214, par. 1) Com</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font9">mends student for progress and love shown for truth and tells of many new ones being invited to share in field ministry during special activity. Invites him into service, making definite arrangements, then leaves some handbills to invite friends to special talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Each one should prepare well and be conscious of building up new ones for the ministry. Study conductors will review the three points on Sunday mornings, taking one each week for the next three weeks. All publishers should immediately start this three-week program leading up to Memorial. Follow through with a kind, encouraging invitation and we will have many more new ones sharing in the ministry with us in April, to make the 20-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">23 min; AU Can Share in Inviting Others to Memorial and Public Talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Memorial activity and special talk bring added privileges of service. All want to have fullest possible part by (1) inviting persons of good will to attend and (2) personally attending. In addition to making back-calls on persons with whom studies are being conducted, and inviting friends, relatives, etc., the Society suggests all “Watchtower” and “Awake!” subscribers be invited to attend. (Per arrangement under Announcements) How is this to be done in our congregation? Look in on study group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (7 min.) Study conductor enthusiastically talks about Memorial and public talk to his small group. Reads Memorial invitation slip and group makes appropriate comments. Two give experiences they had using the slips last year and say how they look forward to using the invitations again. Conductor gives out slips, asks if any have more than they can care for or if any wish more, as he has some slips for publishers who have moved. After all slips are out, a new publisher who did not participate in this service last year asks for suggestions on using invitation. Study conductor feels all would benefit from discussing Society’s suggestion for inviting subscribers to attend Memorial and also the special public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (6 min.) Conductor discusses with group the following: “We are making calls on all ‘Watchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ subscribers, personally inviting them to two important events soon to be held by Jehovah’s witnesses. The most important event of the year for all Christians, the celebration of the Memorial of Christ’s death, this year is Thursday, March 30. This is the one and only celebration Christians are commanded to keep. Regarding it Jesus said, at Luke 22:19 . - . [Read]. In obedience to Jesus’ command Jehovah’s witnesses and others of good will will be meeting for the celebration on</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">March 30 in over 21,000 congregations in 179 different countries. It will be held . . . [Show time and place on Memorial slip, and give slip to householder]. Also, I’d like to invite you to attend a special Bible lecture Sunday, April 2. The title is ‘The Sacred Bible and Our Problem of Survival.’ [Give handbill to householder.] Arrangements have been made for this talk to be given in over 21,000 congregations, Sunday, April 2. I know you would enjoy and benefit greatly from this Bible talk.” Make definite arrangements for them to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (4 min.) New publisher very pleased with helpful information. Conductor asks if someone would like to volunteer to demonstrate such a call. New publisher volunteers. Using one in attendance as householder, gives model presentation, includes making definite arrangements to stop for person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encouragement for all to be diligent. Write down names of all you want to invite. If some cannot be reached, an invitation can be sent by mail, but personal contact is recommended; and, remember, the best way to help people attend the first time is to bring them with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on slogan at bottom of page 4, based on 1 Peter 4:9.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (If this is the last service meeting before Memorial, encourage publishers to be diligent in applying themselves to Memorial activities. Cover pertinent points in “Special Memorial Activity” article that apply before next meeting.)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> To be a servant of Jehovah not only is a great privilege but makes possible salvation for us and those who hear us. How important it is to regularly praise his name! (Heb. 13:15) Are you regularly sharing in Jehovah’s service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Records at the Society’s office show that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">72</span><span class="font10"> percent of all publishers in the United States have been baptized. Knowing many undedicated publishers approaching baptism are regular publishers, one would expect to see many more than 72 percent of all publishers regular in the service. What are the facts? Reports show only 67 percent of all publishers to be regular publishers. Based on even the difference between 72 percent and 67 percent, 5 percent would mean at least 12,500 dedicated publishers do not regularly share in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What is the reason for irregularity? It appears that some publishers are left on their own before becoming well grounded in the truth and in time their zeal fades. Others fail to take needed time for personal study, and some allow old-</span></p>

Beside each subscriber’s name should be shown the name of the publisher who obtained the subscription. This will be given to the publishers by the middle of March so they can invite all subscribers to attend the Memorial and the special talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&lt;&amp;■ Congregations that have not submitted special orders for the April 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and April 22 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> are requested to do so immediately.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Individually each dedicated publisher should be keenly conscious of his spiritual welfare. Jehovah’s Word must be studied regularly and its principles followed consistently. A good schedule of theocratic activity is needed, including time for study, meetings and service. Right thinking and right actions go hand in hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Congregational!}<sup>7</sup>, all servants and mature publishers will want to assist and encourage new and weaker ones to study, attend meetings and share in field service. Overseers and their assistants can help many by personal, encouraging, upbuilding visits to ascertain the cause of spiritual weaknesses and then to aid them to advance to maturity. Those who are called on should appreciate the love shown by others in making visits and arranging to assist them. By all recognizing the seriousness of regularly sharing in the ministry and by wholeheartedly working together much can and will be done to aid more to regularly praise Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Teach Children to Be Efficient Ministers</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Children are not born into the ministry. They must be trained for it, and parents must help them along the way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Children are born mimics. They will imitate the parent in study, prayer and in the ministry. So set before them a right example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Keep the child’s age in mind. Use teaching methods that will match his age. An early lesson is one of appreciation for the truth. Always speak highly of the ministry. Instill in his mind that when he is in the service of God he must always be properly dressed for service and that his conduct must be above reproach. Rather than burdening him down with a lot of do’s and don’t’s, teach him the why’s and wherefore’s, Jehovah’s principles ; these are the things that will aid him to become an efficient minister.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Give a child something to do when he goes with you in the field ministry. Have him offer a handbill, read a scripture, present the magazines, and so forth. Rehearse what he is to do beforehand so he knows that he can do it. Then commend him when he does well. Parents should work with their children in the service and see to it that their children have opportunity to share in the ministry every month and are regular publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As the children grow in ability prepare the sermon with them, rehearsing presentations together, acting as, householder in practice sessions at home. Help them to learn the sermons well. Go with them to the doors until they are sure they can give the sermon. Supervise their work. Encourage them to be progressive, to improve, to advance to maturity. Fix goals for them to meet. It gives them a thrill to be able to reach the goals that you set for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Encourage children to share more fully in the ministry. Encourage them to vacation pioneer each year during the school vacation. Urge them to talk about their experiences in the field, how they got people to take the magazines, and so forth. This shows them you care. Bring children to the meetings regularly. Help them to prepare comments to give. Mature publishers, include children in your demonstrations. Call on them to comment. Have them enroll in the theocratic ministry school. By home training and by sharing together in all the congregation’s activities help your children to become efficient ministers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Lately stickers or signs have been posted on the front door of a number of homes to the effect that the occupants are members of a certain religion and do not want to be bothered by one who is “evangelizing,” In such cases what should we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Generally it is best not to make an issue of such signs. If the issue is not raised by the householder it is best to ignore such and tactfully go ahead with our sermon. We have a divine obligation to preach and, of course, we know beforehand that some will not hear.—Ezek. 2:5; 3:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If, however, the householder raises the issue and points to the sign, you could say: “I appreciate your sincerity and desire to do what is right. I am sure too that you desire peace, security and happiness for all people. No doubt you pray the ‘Our Father,’ or the ‘Lord’s Prayer.’ We do too I In fact, it is this peaceful message of God's kingdom that motivates us to come to your door and share something that</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Importance of Home Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Right thinking brings life: wrong thinking means death. This world is passing away because its thinking is based on doctrines of demons, lying traditions, paganism and fleshly desires. (1 John 2:15-17) Jehovah’s witnesses, copying Jesus, champion right thinking, Christian thinking, based on the will and purpose of Jehovah. This we gladly do by preaching and conducting upward of 646,000 home Bible studies. Through such studies thousands in all continents have transformed their thinking and come into unity with Jehovah and his organization. Your personal experiencing of this vital transformation illustrates the importance of home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As Armageddon rapidly approaches, the importance of Bible studies increases. Missionaries and special pioneers recognize this, as shown by their conducting in most cases better than eight studies each week. In the United States, for the first three months of this service has made us very happy’.” (Then, depending upon the reaction, go into the sermon or whatever part of it you may be able to deliver.) If you see this is not advisable, then perhaps you could leave a tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> On the other hand, some have had splendid results by tactfully referring to the sign, saying: “I certainly admire your sincerity, and no doubt this sign indicates that yours is a religious family. Hence you may wonder why I call. It is because God told me to come. (Isa. 61:1-3) Some feel we call to change their religion. Actually we have not come to solicit church membership, but to share the good news of God’s kingdom, which one day will assure universal peace and happiness. Don’t you long for such a day?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The main thing is to be discerning and tactful. Strive to reach a point of general agreement as a foundation for further conversation. If persons are adamant, or very opposed, do not argue with them. Ours is a peaceful message. At the same time we want to be clean from the blood of all men and should make a reasonable effort to deliver the message wherever possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">year, special pioneers averaged 7.8 Bible studies while regular pioneers averaged five studies. During this period congregation publishers averaged .6. From this sowing of Bible knowledge conies many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our desire is to make our Bible studies good ones by preparing well and conducting them every week. So doing, many receptive hearts soon will see the need of dedication and baptism. To that end, all missionaries and special pioneers are urged to conduct between eight and ten Bible studies weekly, reporting at least ten each month. Regular pioneers, endeavor to conduct five to seven studies each week, reporting at least seven each month. Congregation publishers, share in the joyful harvest by conducting a Bible study each week and reporting at least one every month. The prospects of happiness are great for those who fully appreciate the importance of home Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Memorial and the weekend following it begin the big push for April, the month in which we seek to attain the 20-percent quota. For the United States this is 279,158 publishers. We can do much this month in laying the foundation for meeting the quota. It will be possible to start many new ones in the service now. Follow through, of course, in helping them out during April and the months to come. Invite them to go along with you in the regular house-to-house work or in the magazine work. Many excellent opportunities will present themselves during March to help new ones share in the service in connection with the Memorial celebration. Take them with you when you make back-calls on persons whom you want to invite to the Memorial. In all features of our ministry, let us copy the Master’s manner of teaching, that our productivity during March may pave the way for the sought-after 20-percent increase for April.</span></p>

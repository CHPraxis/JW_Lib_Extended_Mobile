<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Every human heart is a treasure house. One’s destiny depends on the kind of treasure stored there. Is it wicked treasure? Then the person will send out wicked things, leading to his destruction. Is it good treasure? Then its possessor will send out good things, leading to his salvation and the salvation of others. In directing human hearts to become repositories of the good treasures of God's Word, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower </span><span class="font12">magazine has played an unexcelled role. &quot;The greatest aid that the Society has,” says the 1961 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font12">“for helping believers in God's Word to understand the Holy Scriptures is the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine.”</span></p></li>

From January through April we will be offering a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and three booklets, for $1.

(Congregation publishers will remit 90c for each new subscription.) We all want to make this the biggest campaign to date. We can do so by all diligently striving to reach our respective quotas: For congregation publishers it is two subscriptions for the campaign; for pioneers 20, and for special pioneers 30.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> How can we reach our quotas? Our enthusiasm issuing from good hearts is a great aid.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Speaking from Good Hearts for Salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text,* comments. 10 min: Talk on “Speaking from Good Hearts for Salvation.” (See “Watchtower,” June 1, 1960, pp. 329-340, and January 1, 1961, p. 31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Speak from Good Hearts for Salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">New Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Importance of being well prepared as we engage in the ministry. From outset of “Watchtower” subscription campaign all will want to get in mind, for effective use, the sermon outlined below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Preparing the sermon. Chairman will develop sermon by discussion with audience. All should follow along in “Kingdom Ministry” and look up in their Bible the scriptures considered. Keep sermon theme in mind and tie it in with each scripture considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Man’s Future in This Space Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A suggested introduction: “I’m associated with a group of Bible students [ministers or some other appropriate expression] who are volunteering their time to make a brief call to discuss a matter that most of us today have wondered about. The subject is: What is man’s future in the space age? Will man eventually have to leave the earth to survive destruction or to gain peace? and, Does God approve of man’s aim to live in space? These questions have been raised by many. We have heard many opinions of men on these matters, but did you ever wonder what God’s thoughts on these matters are? (Let householder express self.) Notice at Ps. 115:16 the Bible tells us”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Man created to live on earth, not in space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Ps. 115:16</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Earth to be inhabited, not destroyed by man &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 45:18</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Wicked destroyed; righteous man’s future home on earth, not in space</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—Ps. 37:10, 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessings for righteous in future on earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rev. 21:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A suggested conclusion: “These scriptures make it clear, don’t they, that man’s future is not to live in space but on this earth with countless blessings in store for the righteous? That it has been God’s will for man to live on earth is expressed very nicely in this journal, ‘The Watchtower.’ ” (Have pertinent point to tie in with sermon and then make subscription offer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) Publisher who is a good teacher and well prepared demonstrates use of sermon. After subscription is placed, a study is started in “Good News” booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Kindly encourage all to apply suggestions in main article on preparation. Much joy and many privileges will be the lot of all who diligently prepare and thereafter faithfully share in field ministry, offering the “Watchtower” subscription.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Talk on amount of work required to compile “Yearbook” report.

(2 Cor. 3:3) It relates problems encountered and how they were overcome, joys and experiences in ministry, world-wide unity of Jehovah’s organization. Covers reports from 21,008 congregations sent to 85 branches and forwarded to Society’s president, who condensed and prepared “Yearbook” report for all members of New World society. How shall we use it to get most good from it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (4 min.) Chairman interviews exemplary family with children on use of “Yearbook” in family discussion at table.

(Other points as time allows.) Brother from audience asks question on value of calendar and how it can be used. Chairman asks audience for comments.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The object of the theocratic ministry school is to train ministers to preach the good news effectively. Hence, the emphasis is on teaching in giving the student talks. The student should prepare with a threefold purpose in mind: (1) to benefit personally from the preparation and delivery of the assignment, (2) to improve his ability in the field ministry by building his teaching ability, and (3) to edify the audience and furnish an example in teaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The first student talk, beginning March 5, will be based on Bible words. The student should understand the usage of the word or phrase in the Bible, particularly by getting the setting of its usage in the various scriptures cited after the word in the index. This will require reading the whole chapter in -which the word is found and, at times, several surrounding chapters. The student will need to do much research, using the various indexes of the Society. See where </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and other publications of the Society have commented on these scriptures. The scriptures may be used in any appropriate order, and, where time permits, other related scriptures having a direct bearing on the theme may be used. Get a good rounded-out view of the subject and then you will be able to select an appropriate theme, which will stress the important aspects of the word coherently, logically and interestingly. At times the subject and theme might be the same. Remember : The material is to be presented “simply and clearly as though</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For the second student talks the student should read over the assigned portion many times and be discerning as to the oral emphasis or sense stress and the feeling that should go into the delivery. An appropriate introduction and conclusion, stressing the theme, will round out the presentation. We should be able to read the Scriptures well, as we are using our Bibles constantly in the field. Make God’s Word live with enthusiasm and feeling as you read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> All brothers enrolled should have experience in reading and all should have experience in developing a talk. Hence, while a reading assignment might seem easier and more fitting for younger and newer publishers, we should not confine them to reading assignments.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Since the ministry school is a provision from Jehovah for all, no publisher should feel hesitant to enroll because of fear he will not be able to prepare and deliver a student talk.

Solicit the help of the school servant and other capable brothers. Move ahead in the power of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazine had an unprecedented distribution in English when the special October 8 issue was in use. At Brooklyn 2,930,000 were printed and all have been shipped out. The general average distribution of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> in English for Brooklyn is 1,580,610, so the increase was 1,349,390.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The London branch printed 674,500, while a normal run would be 340,000. At Toronto the usual printing is 180,000, but for the special issue 408,500 had to be made. All branches mentioned received many extra orders by telephone, telegrams and special delivery letters. A 4,013,000 printing! Everyone supported the campaign and enjoyed a share in the greatest </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> distribution to date. Unnumbered fine experiences have been reported. Jehovah blessed the campaign. Soon the same message will go out in many other languages, and we anticipate the same good support everywhere. The message is forceful and should prepare our field for future harvests in men of good will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup>A </span><span class="font12">stands for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">attention.</span><span class="font12"> If children are going to pay attention to meetings, they must understand their importance. Parents must show them that being present at meetings is for their benefit, that God requires it, and that information learned at meetings can be applied in their daily living.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup>B</span><span class="font12"> is for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">benefit.</span><span class="font12"> If children are going to gain benefit from meetings, interest must be created. This can be done by whetting the child’s appetite with questions that will be answered at the meeting. At home a review of the points learned will be helpful and commendation for progress good for the mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> C </span><span class="font12">is for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">comment.</span><span class="font12"> Aid children to comment at meetings by preparing </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> comment or two with them. Better a brief one in their own words, perhaps even memorized at first, than one read from the paragraph. Advance preparation and practice are essential to this end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> D </span><span class="font12">stands for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">distractions.</span><span class="font12"> Distractions can rob much from what might otherwise be beneficial. If parents turn around each time someone comes in late or there is a minor disturbance, the child will instinctively follow the lead. Urge the child to listen rather than furnish it with noisy toys or pencil and paper to distract both itself and others. A good way to keep a child alert is to have him look up in his Bible every scripture that the speakers cite. This is good practice for them too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> E </span><span class="font12">is for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">enthusiasm.</span><span class="font12"> To be enthusiastic about meetings an alert mind is required. If the child plays endlessly during the day, then is hustled off to a meeting, it will most likely fall asleep. How much more beneficial the meeting will be if the child is made to take a nap before the meetings! Then, refreshed and awake, it can with enthusiasm listen to what is going on and learn.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>e</sup> F </span><span class="font12">is for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">folly.</span><span class="font12"> Folly that is bound up in the heart of a child is more apt to express itself when a number of children are together. Therefore, children should sit with their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> G </span><span class="font12">stands for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">grown-ups.</span><span class="font12"> Grownups can help children benefit from meetings by helping them to have a share. The ministry school servant should personally approach young brothers and sisters and encourage them to enroll and accept speaking assignments. Speakers can address portions of their talks directly to the children. Parents should see to it that children are with them at all meetings, there to listen and learn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Those Who “Have No Money”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Out of the heart’s abundance his mouth speaks,” said Jesus. (Luke 6:45) Is your heart filled with good things learned from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font12"> Then you will be motivated to place subscriptions at every opportunity. But what if people say, “I have no money”? You could use some of the following suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> “I can appreciate your situation. There is considerable demand on our limited finances these days, but would you like to learn of the time when fear, lack of security, poverty and unemployment will forever cease? That day is close! </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> points to God's kingdom, which will bring paradise conditions to this earth shortly, and a year’s subscription is only $1. Perhaps you could contribute something (25 cents or 50 cents) toward it now and we could work out some arrangement to obtain the rest later. I know you will enjoy it immensely.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In rural areas and other sections of the country you might say, “Lack of money is a problem, isn’t it? However, we often trade with folks who sincerely desire the subscription. Perhaps you have some canned goods equivalent to the subscription price of $1. We have to</span></p>

Each of the 258 circuits will have from 16 up to 18 congregations, which means that each congregation will be served about every four months. To make arrangements for 54 new circuits it was necessary to revamp the whole existing circuit arrangement. Each congregation and isolated group affected by the changes will be notified of the new circuit they are in and who their circuit servant will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Circuit assemblies will continue throughout this period of adjustments. If you have been notified of a circuit assembly for your present circuit and later are notified you are in a new circuit, you are enbuy canned goods anyway, and if it will help you to get the subscription I would be happy to trade for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">*Also, in farm areas you could say, “Perhaps you have chicken or some other fowl for which we could trade. If not, may I suggest an equitable exchange of fruit or vegeta» bles.” (Note: A knowledge of the fair market value of the above items will be helpful, plus a sincere, kind approach, assuring the householder you have his spiritual interests at heart.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If he does not subscribe, you could offer the two latest copies of the magazines for ten cents. Make </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> written record of the placements, and if the householder indicates a sincere desire to have the subscription you could say: “Now that you have the two latest copies, let me assure you it will be my pleasure to return in two weeks ahd make the next issues available. In this way you will be regularly getting the copies, and I feel sure they will prove to be spiritually upbuilding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Hence we are encouraged to be alert and place subscriptions at every opportunity. Do not hesitate to use the above suggestions. Many pioneers and publishers report excellent results by utilizing them. Speak from a good heart and strive for success in the subscription campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">couraged to attend and support both assemblies, especially where the two are several months apart. We are confident all will co-operate in this transition and will benefit greatly from the arrangements being put into operation to provide more and better service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> You will be glad to know, too, that about February 1 the fine school facilities at Brooklyn will house the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The ten-month course for the new school will feature special training for those holding responsible positions in order to care better for the work throughout the world.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> How winning are the words at Ephesians 4:32: “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you” I How warm and understanding this command, yet possessing tremendous drawing power I It calls on us to imitate Jehovah, who, as Jesus stated, “is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.”—Luke 6:35,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s kindness is irresistible to the sheeplike ones. It attracts them to his fold.

<p><span class="font0">Vacation Pioneering Is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">for You</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> There are so many reasons why </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font6"> should vacation pioneer. Why not plan right now to arrange your affairs to do so this summer? Do not miss out on the happy experiences enjoyed by vacation pioneers and the opportunity to improve your ability as a teacher by being out in the field service daily. Think, too, of the blessings to persons of good will and the increased praise to Jehovah by the increased service of vacation pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> During the last service year there were, on an average, 1,825 vacation pioneers each month, or almost 22,000 for the entire year. Those who vacation pioneered were able to devote over a million and a may be used again if the publishers desire. Be prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Fine progress is being made in the number of studies being conducted: from September’s 174,475, we have increased through March to 197,068. Keep up the good work. Many more studies may be started with those who attended the Lord’s Evening Meal and who do not have a study and desire one. Special calls should be made on these. This, too, will be showing kindness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Kindness expresses itself, not only in words, but more so in deeds. And we can show such kindness by making a special effort during May to assist all who shared in service during April. Personal assistance is going to be necessary to aid the new ones to advance to maturity. Keep studying with them. Kindly encourage them on the way to life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Another opportunity to show kindness will be on Decoration Day, May 30. This will be a special magazine day. All congregations should arrange meetings for field service convenient for the congregation. You may desire to minister in the cem-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">half more hours to the ministry than if they had remained congregation publishers, devoting an average number of hours. They were able to make almost half a million back-calls, conduct over sixty thousand Bible studies and place over a million and a half magazines!

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Theme: Attracting the Sheeplike by Kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">10 min: Talk on “Attracting the Sheeplike by Kindness.” (See “Watchtower,” June 15, 1960, pp. 361-373, and May 1, 1961, p. 286.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font5">Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Attract the Sheeplike by Kindness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">22 min: New Sermon “What Is Your Hope?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Sermons overcome false teachings and instill truth in minds of millions. Many believe their destiny after death is life in heaven. Bible holds forth hope of life on earth in Paradise for most of mankind. Truth needs to be made clear ■ on this matter. Sermon “What Is Your Hope?” will provide answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(12 min.) Chairman discusses sermon with audience, particularly stressing transitions between scriptures. Suggests publishers take notes in margin of “Kingdom Ministry” or elsewhere. This introduction may be helpful: “Good morning, my name is---. As</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a minister, I am very much interested in the hope people have for the future. Many people sincerely believe that they will live in heaven after death. Perhaps this is your belief. Have you ever considered the possibility of people having perfect and endless life in happiness on earth? [Let them comment.] The Bible shows that both the hope of life in heaven and the hope of life on earth have been given to man by God. For example, Jesus, as his words are recorded at John 14:2, said that he was preparing a place in heaven for some of his followers. . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Life in heaven opened up by Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">—John 14:2</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Limited number of 144,000 “purchased from the earth”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">—Rev. 14:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Others in tombs may gain life on earth again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 5:28, 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions pray for Paradise conditions on earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 6:9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After completing sermon, transition into book might be: “A picture is said to be worth a thousand words, so perhaps you could best appreciate the grand conditions to come on the earth by looking at this picture on page 241 of the book ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.’ Whatever your present hope is, you would undoubtedly like to learn what the Bible says about the hope of life on earth in a restored Paradise such as pictured here. You may have a copy of this Bible-study aid, which describes this wonderful hope, on a contribution of only 75c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Introduction and conclusion only suggestions. Others may be used and another picture, such as the one on pages 224-225. Keep prominent the theme of hope for future life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(5 min.) Competent brother who is good teacher demonstrates sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Sermon will achieve good effect if used by all. Enthusiastically present sermon and book, for they can open way to life for millions, and be alert to start studies on initial placement or on return calls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4, based on Colossians 4:5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 15 min: Talk based on May 1, 1961, “Watchtower” article, “The Ministry as a Career.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization” article “Reviving Inactive Ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20 min: Demonstration on “Personal Assistance to New Ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Many new ones started service in April. Must not leave them on their own. Lovingly help them to progress to maturity. Continued study and encouragement are vital. And if obstacles stand in way, they must be recognized and help offered to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SCENE I (3 min.) Congregation servant and study conductor (Brother Helpful) are checking list of new publishers with his group who reported in April. Servant commends Helpful for success in starting new ones in April but notices some that may need help to continue. Sister Unsure, for example, was out the first week in April but has not been out since. Recalls she has not been to meetings for last couple of weeks. Asked what the problem might be, Helpful does not know. There must be obstacles. What are they in this case?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Cites conscientious effort of servant and conductor. Demonstrates real love and concern for new ones. Next observe how Helpful learns problems and suggests measures to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SCENE II (7 min.) Helpful, talking to Sister Unsure, commends her for progress made. Is happy that she is in the New World society and has seen the importance of sharing in the public praise of Jehovah. Tactfully notes she has not been out in service during May and has missed most meetings lately. Makes known his desire to help if she has encountered difficulties. She relates how opposing husband, large family, pressure from relatives have all slowed her down. Helpful gives her loving encouragement and shows her from Bible how this test can be overcome. Reads 1 Corinthians 7:14, with regard to unbelieving husband, also 1 Peter 3:1-4. Be patient with him and set good example. May win him over. Meanwhile, she should be faithful to Jehovah. Helpful asks if he and wife can stop to get acquainted with him; this has helped in many cases like hers. Helpful then suggests it may be possible for some sisters in service center to assist her with children so she can be free for service on some occasions. If not possible to engage in service on weekends, then can share in midweek activity. As for opposing relatives, explains this is often the case and reads Matthew 10:32-36. Show them by good conduct she has truth. Some may be won over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Emphasizes necessity of using Bible to encourage and help new ones. Show loving concern, aid them to see we want to help them to make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SCENE III (3 min.) Several months later. Sister Unsure now more sure of herself. Helpful commends her for splendid attitude and fine progress. She comments her husband is showing some interest in truth since getting acquainted with Helpful. Relatives have learned she intends to stick by her “new religion” and have eased off pressure. She has shared in midweek service and now places quota of magazines and is learning current sermon. Much happier person in evidence now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Philippians 2:4 is cited and all study conductors urged to show loving concern for sheep in their charge. Follow’ through on lists provided by the assistant congregation servant on 1st and 15th of the month. Personal assistance key to most problems. Training program provides such help to those assigned under it. For others, like Sister Unsure, loving attention must be provided and good results w’ill be forthcoming.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneering &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">merit, everyone can pioneer sometime each year. Those in school have two or more months of vacation. How beneficially and enjoyably this time could be used by vacation pioneering! Housewives can vacation pioneer with their children, setting a good example for them and encouraging them toward a full-time pioneer career. The two-week vacation pioneer arrangement is excellent for those doing full-time secular work. Whole families can spend their vacation pioneering with their congregation or in unassigned territories. Many places in New England, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, and others, would be fine locations to spend vacations and at the same time work unassigned territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Begin now in making your plans to vacation pioneer this summer. Be a vacation pioneer!</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviving Inactive Ones (Part 2)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In the April </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font6">information was given with regard to reviving inactive ones. Has your congregation arranged for a mature brother or sister to visit those not attending meetings? The Society has already heard of many good results and it is obvious Jehovah’s blessing is upon this work. What else might now be done to show tender affection for these sheep who have become inactive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Each overseer should now make definite arrangements to see that each inactive one living in his territory is called on by a mature, capable publisher with the idea in mind of lovingly helping him; and keep calling on him so as to build him up. (Heb. 12:12, 13) Mature brothers and sisters can be directed to share in this program under the supervision of the congregation overseer. Also, the Society suggests that the circuit and district servants visiting congregations utilize periods of time for this purpose in between calls in tiie afternoon or when they finish their territory. They should check to see how much of this work has been done in the last month. One circuit servant reports that a call was made with a pioneer sister on an individual who had nor associated with the organization for three years. After a Scriptural discussion this person accepted the invitation to participate in the field service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">A joyful time was experienced. Later on that same day she attended the public meeting and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">study. While not all experiences will turn out as this one did, and we do not expect all of them to respond so quickly, yet we certainly want to do all we can to help revive inactive ones.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Another circuit servant reports that a call was made on a brother who had not associated for several years. Scripturally he was encouraged and he was at the public talk on Sunday with his wife and two children. Arrangements were made for him to attend the service center near his home, and a home Bible study was established for the family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Clearly our responsibility toward the inactive ones is to shepherd and lead them gently in the way that leads to life. (1 Thess. 2:7, 8, 11) A nursing mother cherishing her own children is tenderness and gentleness personified. This same principle should be applied when makingcalls on these inactive ones and conducting studies with them. Our calls should be friendly, warm and upbuilding. As they grow stronger by attending meetings they will need encouragement to begin to preach. Progressively they should be given such encouragement so that wholesome results may be produced. In fact, we should make every effort to aid each one to grow to maturity so that fewer will become inactive in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’Thrilling indeed are many experiences to be had. Never should we forget the purpose of our ministry, which includes the principle outlined at Galatians 6:9, 10: ‘‘So let us not give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out. Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">especially toward those related to us in the faith.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Attract the Sheeplike &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">eteries or in the house-to-house work. After hearing a brief sermon at the cemetery, a woman said: “This is so wonderful to hear. I have been coming to this cemetery on this day for thirty years and this is the first time this has happened to me. Can I hear more about this?” The brother spoke about the hope of the resurrection. We all have this kind privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Remember, kindness attracts. Jehovah’s kindness through Christ attracted us to him. Let us imitate Jehovah by showing kindness to strangers by visiting them with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Put More Time in Field Ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Most appropriate for our time are the words of Paul: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” (Eph. 5:15, 16) Jehovah’s people have taken this advice to heart, and what marvelous blessings they have received! Time they formerly used in pursuit of old-world interests is now employed to study the Bible, attend congregation meetings and teach others the “good news of the kingdom.” Bor field service alone congregation publishers in the United States have been able to “buy out” 9.7 hours a month, on an average, this service year, which means well over two million hours each month in public praise to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> However, some are able to report more than the average in number of hours. Why so? It may be that they do not have as many family responsibilities, or perhaps they enjoy better family co-operation. Or it may be that they have a deeper appreciation of the service and go out of their way to do more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> As our vision of the new world brightens so does our desire to have a greater share in the ministry, but practical organization is needed to implement that right desire. If you feel that you can do more in Jehovah’s service, decide when and where you are going to do it and then hold to that decision. Regularity is one of the big factors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> In planning for a fuller share in the ministry ask yourself, Have I seriously considered spending a full three hours in service on Sunday? sharing in prestudy service? participating in midweek group witnessing? making back-calls or conducting a home Bible study an evening a week? having a part in Magazine Day activity every week? Those who have taken any or all of these steps have been richly blessed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> It is good for all to seek ways to enlarge their share in the ministry. Congregation publishers should all seek to have a share in the field ministry </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">each week,</span><span class="font6"> reporting, if possible, at least ten hours a month. Of course, many will find it possible to do more than that. Pioneers, too, should make it a point to meet or exceed their 100-houi’ quota, and special pioneers their 150-hour quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>0</sup> The opportunity that is now ours of proclaiming the good news of the establishment of God’s kingdom will never be repeated. So now is the time to arrange the use of our time to seek the Kingdom first.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Developing Magazine Routes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In the April </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font6">good counsel was given on starting magazine routes. Routes may be developed from house to house or from store to store. One congregation publisher in New Jersey has averaged seventy magazines a month for the past year on his house-to-house route. Recently this publisher obtained thirteen subscriptions in one morning on his route and also started three fine Bible studies. In Pennsylvania a brother and his wife have developed a store-to-store magazine route, with each one placing over one hundred magazines every month, and they have been doing this for several years now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Would you like to share in such enriching experiences? Remember, the foundation is laid on the first call wherever magazines are placed. Only five simple points need be noted on your House-to-House Record as the basis for successful routes. They are (1) householder’s name, (2) address, (3) date of visit, (4) issues placed, (5) article featured.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Needed: More to Work Unassigned Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Congregation publishers, vacation and regular pioneers, will you answer the call? Over 900 counties in the United States still contain unassigned territory. Many of these have not been worked for many years, some ten and more. If each congregation and publisher will share, virtually all unassigned territory can be worked this summer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> That it is possible, consider the following. Back in 1952, when there were about 125,000 publishers, 1,290 unassigned counties were worked. Last year, with about twice as many publishers, only 377 counties were worked. Many more workers are needed. Will you share?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup>Many wonderful experiences await those who will. One woman contacted in such territory asked to go along in service and another said that she read only two books, the Bible and every winter a green one. What book was the green one? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Circuit and district servants</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> When returning two weeks later, you could say: “Good morning, Mrs. Jones [use name, for this personalizes call], I have come to bring your two latest copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> In this issue there is an appealing article on [refer to specific article]. They are only 10c. I am sure you will enjoy them immensely.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Brothers who have routes report that more warmth and friendliness are generated by this means. Children too can participate in this splendid work and get good results. As you call each time it is not advisable to say anything that would obligate the householder, but just return every two weeks with the two latest magazines. In this way a warm relationship will be enjoyed and a productive route will be developed. Also, those who advise you they no longer wish the magazines can be dropped from your route. Some are already enjoying the blessings of having a magazine, route. Are you? If not, try the suggestions given above and use to the full this splendid means of increasing magazine placements.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">when attending the special sixteen-day Kingdom Ministry School at Brooklyn were impressed with the need for more to do unassigned territory work, and they will offer practical suggestions and encouragement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Apply for unassigned territory right away and as soon as your assignment is received organize so that you will be able to spend the most time in the territory to accomplish the maximum. Good results have been realized by having someone go ahead to arrange for things such as public meeting locations, advertising, planning for efficient coverage of the assignment, and finding places to stay. Isolated publishers should be contacted so that they may work with you and benefit by the much-needed association with their brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> There are many joys and heartwarming experiences awaiting those who accept an unassigned territory for the summer. Will you share?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">BCT WOilB HEWS </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$ Spain: Persecution of Jehovah's people continues. Reports of three special pioneers were not received because they were “kidnaped&quot; and held incommunicado.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hungary: Word has been received that the branch servant was imprisoned March 13, 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; Dominican Republic: There are now 24 special pioneers. One started 13 studies that he had before the work was banned, and his wife started 11 of her former studies again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Newfoundland: Another new Kingdom Hall has been completed, this one at Lewisporfe, bringing the total halls owned by the congregations to 12, with four other congregations preparing to build or in the course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Knorr’s service tour: In Mexico he spoke to 7,287 brothers from the 71 units in Mexico City; while there he announced the proposed construction of a new five-story addition to the branch home and presented “Make Sure of All Things’’ in Spanish. At evening meetings he spoke to 720 in Guatemala City, 277 in Belize, 484 in San Salvador, 255 in Tegucigalpa, and 354 in Managua. He arranged for the building of new branch offices. Kingdom Halls and missionary homes in Honduras and Nicaragua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1961 District Assemblies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> United worshipers of Jehovah everywhere are looking forward to attending the assemblies this summer to take in instruction that Jehovah has for his people in due season. It is always a happy occasion when Jehovah’s witnesses meet together. If you expect to attend one of the June assemblies, you should have your plans consummated by this time and should shortly send your room request form to the convention city. The volunteer service slip should also be filled in and returned to the congregation servant, who, in turn, will sign it and forward it to the convention where you expect to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Keep in mind that the purpose in going to an assembly is to take in accurate knowledge and gain Christian stature. Be there at the beginning of the assembly on Tuesday and, of course, plan to stay until its conclusion, Sunday afternoon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> By attending one of the district assemblies this year we can be recipients of rich spiritual blessings. Truly our hearts will be overflowing with joy and gratitude.</span></p></li></ul>

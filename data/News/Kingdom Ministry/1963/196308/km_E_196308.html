<p><span class="font6">Observe Subjection in All Realms of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As persons who seek everlasting life we must willingly submit to Jehovah’s arrangements in all realms of life. This we endeavor to do with lowliness of mind, whether It is in regard to husbands, political authorities oi’ others. Above all, we observe subjection to Christ and Jehovah. This subjection allows us to live peacefully and to be ready for every good work.—1 Pet. 5:5; Titus 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- Because we are submissive worshipers of Jehovah we will take keen interest in the distribution of the special issue of Awafce/ for August 8. Those in our territory who have a regard for truth and freedom will want to read the article “Is Liberia Losing Its ‘Love of Liberty’?”, which deals thoroughly with the suppression of religious freedom in Liberia and gives details of the mistreatment of Jehovah’s witnesses there. Since the persecution was in connection with the flag-salute issue, ail will be interested in the article “Christian Conscience and the State,” which shows the relationship of Jehovah’s witnesses to the country they live in and their reasons for not saluting the flag of any nation. Our constructive work in the African field is then dealt with in the article “Aiding the African People in a Time of Change.” Everyone should share fully in the distribution of this important special issue.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Taking advantage of all opportunities to work with the special issue will aid us in meeting the suggested goal of ten hours this month. The weather is ideal for weekend activity, midweek service and prestudy work, as well as back-call and Bible study work in the evenings. If you are not yet conducting a Bible study, be conscious of starting studies when literature is Initially placed. Make definite arrangements for a return visit. Let us all continue the fine progress made this service year in Increasing the number of home Bible studies!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Those of you who are family heads are pursuing a wise course if you arrange to keep your children active in the service. In addition to helping them prepare for field service by going over simplified sermons and magazine presentations, work with them in the field service. Encourage the young ones to make wise use of the time available between school terms.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Newer ones and those needing assistance should not be neglected. If you will be away from the congregation on vacation, see that an-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST </span><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: New World News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article, “Observe Subjection in AU Realms of Life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Know Your August 8 “Awake!” magazine. (Publishers should bring their copy to meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) August 8 “Awake!” contains information on suppression of religious freedom in Liberia and how Witnesses were mistreated at a recent assembly. Also, there is an explanation with regard to our stand on the flag-salute issue which should help persons of goodwill to understand our Scriptural position more clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (10 min.) Family group discusses how they will use magazine in field ministry. Each member has already studied entire issue and selected points of interest to him. Father asks son which article he will be using and he mentions “Is Liberia Losing Its ‘Love of Liberty’?”, calling attention to fact that all are interested in freedom and its preservation. When we see freedom threatened it is of concern to us, especially when citizens of this country have their freedom denied and are persecuted by another country. Lovers of freedom will want to know what they can do about it. Daughter then comments she likes that presentation and will use it and possibly the article on “Aiding the African People in a Time of Change” to show that we are benefiting the people by our Christian activity and extensive campaign to reduce illiteracy. Mother is then asked which article or point she will be highlighting. She decides to use article on “Christian Conscience and the State” and will ask what the Christian should do when he sees unrighteousness, and even officials condoning bad things done. How can his conscience guide him if he is asked to do what he knows is not right? All in family heartily agree that magazine contains much information that will appeal to those who are righteously disposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) Mother gives store-to-store presentation usingarticle on “Christian Conscience and the State.” Daughter uses article on “Aiding the African People in a Time of Change” when regular literature offer is refused. In presenting magazines to schoolmates son uses article on flag-salute issue. In Magazine Day activity father uses article on “Is Liberia Losing Its ‘Love of Liberty’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) All will want to become thoroughly familiar with contents of magazine so effective presentations can be made. Plan for a wide distribution so many persons will receive information on these important subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. Remind all to write letters to Liberian officials. (Cover “What Happened Here in June?”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: ‘Preach the Word Urgently’ —At Least Ten Hours a Month. (Talk and comments on results locally and on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life is at stake. This Paul knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore, he urged: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” (2 Tim. 4:2) Today in face of this world’s end brothers are preaching urgently. In one place serious effort resulted in an average of 13 hours per publisher each month for the year. (188 fl2) In another a schedule has helped overcome obstacles. (206 ill) Even new ones are meeting the goal. (76 111) More hours have meant greater joy. (219 113) A sister who once thought she could not make 10 hours a month now averages 25. (244 114) Even the blind manage to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to increase their praise. (252 fl3) Are we each individually averaging ten hours each month? If not, try making a schedule, and stick to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article “Strengthening the Service Centers” (Part 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Start Studies on Initial Call and with Simplified Back-Call Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) There was an increase of over 20,000 Bible studies in the United States from December to April. Thousands of publishers started new studies using the “Look!” booklet. Did you? Whether you have or not up to this time, observe as publisher who has just placed offer uses it to start study on initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (5 min.) Publisher asks householder for a few more minutes to illustrate how the “Look!” booklet can be used m Bible study. (If convenient to step in, do so.) Discuss picture on front cover of booklet. Read message from The Publishers inside front cover. Consider first four paragraphs, reading the questions, then the paragraphs, then discussing the answers to the questions. Suggest that householder read scriptures on page four during the week. Make arrangements for return call to continue discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Encourage all to use this means to start studies. Publisher in audience raises hand and asks what to do if householder does not have time. Chairman suggests making appointment to return later. Be sure to keep appointment. Chairman invites prepared publisher to platform to demonstrate use of simplified sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (8 min.) Publisher explains to chairman that he will renew interest by referring to previous discussion about God’s name, then will add new point from same Bible verse. Publisher demonstrates, using chairman as householder. After renewing acquaintance, publisher might say: “Last time we were discussing the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ (or the ‘Our Father’). (Matt. 6:10) Many pray, ‘Hallowed be thy name.’ We learned God’s name is Jehovah. Then in the prayer we ask, ‘Let your kingdom come and your will be done, as in heaven, also on earth.’ What will it be like when God’s will is done on earth? Jehovah has promised he will make all things new!” Draw attention to cover of “Look!” booklet. Read Revelation 21:4 and proceed as suggested in Scene I. Make arrangements for return call when other members of family will be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Encourage all to follow suggestions and start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Concluding comments, including appropriate comments on convention article “Pasadena Assembly.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">5 mln: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font8">Question-and-answer discussion of article entitled “Continue Studying with Newly Baptized Ones.” 15 min: Talk on “Guard Against Abusive Speech and Obscene Jesting.” (See “Watchtower,” March 1, 1963.) 15 min: Presenting the Good News —disquss and demonstrate points.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Theme: Walking by Faith amid Materialism’s Deceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower,” July 15, 1962, pp. 425437, also issue of September 1, 1963.) 15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article entitled “Attend Public Meetings.” Demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Overturn Teachings “Raised Up Against the Knowledge of God.” (Discussion between two brothers on points made in 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle Paul declared that the weapons of a Christian are “powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.” “For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God,” he said. (2 Cor. 10:4, 5) Our brothers today are having like experiences. As a result, religious leaders publicly admit being wrong. (232 fll) Evolutionists’ lips are stilled. (216 111) People are rescued from atheism. (122 HI) Mormon doctrine is overturned. (158 114-6) A priest is routed. (194 fll) The doctrine of Mary’s eternal virginity is exposed. (198 1f2) Seventhday Adventists are silenced. (231 1(3, 4) People are made free from witchcraft and immorality. (212 Hl) Others gain freedom from spiritism. (301 HD Great joy is thus reaped, for these ones are freed for salvation as servants of God Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 mln: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NOTE: Congregations attending the Pasadena assembly will adjust their meetings to include appropriate material in the June “Kingdom Ministry” regarding the assembly on service meeting programs prior to attending the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">arrangements, very likely through the Bible study servant, either for you to accompany someone who is conducting a study in one of these basic publications or for you to have someone study with you personally.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Strengthening the Service Centers (Part 3)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In previous articles the privileges and responsibilities of the congregation overseer and the assistant congregation servant in connection with strengthening the service centers were discussed. Now the role of the Bible study servant comes in for consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Bible study servant is an expert in the field of making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies. It is good for him to be a congregation book study conductor, for this enables him to work very closely with a study group, assisting each one to learn and use a simplified back-call sermon and then participate in the Bible study work as soon as possible. By working with a study group for two, three or four months, or In some cases even longer, he will be able to help the entire group to participate fully in the back-call and Bible study work. He can actually start studies for some publishers and encourage them to carry on in this vital work. Others can be trained to follow up the interest properly and start their own studies. Still others can be assisted by having them work with someone proficient in starting home Bible studies and who may have</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">tory are dependent on us to learn the way to life. Congregations that do not have unassigned territory will work congregation territory that is least covered, utilizing midweek service in addition to weekend activity to do so. Both regular and vacation pioneers can assist the congregation greatly in this by taking the initiative in inviting publishers to work with them. This will provide companions for pioneers and will enable publishers to have a greater share in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> By our observing subjection to Jehovah’s arrangements through his organization on earth, August will be another grand month of praise to his name. Diligently offer the special August 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> at all opportunities and continue the regular offer of two books and two booklets for $1 in congregation territory, or the offer of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription and a book for $1.50 in unassigned territory. In this way we shall be aiding persons of goodwill to take in knowledge that will enable them to come into a proper relationship with Jehovah so they too can observe subjection in all realms of their lives. This will mean Jehovah’s blessing and prospects for everlasting life in his new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">more studies than he can personally conduct. The one being trained can then assume the responsibility for one of these home Bible studies. In these ways the group can be greatly strengthened for effective participation in these two important activities in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When the Bible study work with a particular group has improved, the congregation servant will transfer the Bible study servant to work with another group as a study conductor. Unless distance and circumstances make this arrangement impossible, moving the Bible study servant from group to group is highly recommended for best results in Bible study service. Additionally, any publisher in the group experiencing some difficulty or desiring some aid in regard to making back-calls or conducting studies should feel perfectly free to talk this over with the Bible study servant; he will be happy to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Before being transferred to a new group, the Bible study servant should, following the last book study with the group, give a short talk offering practical counsel and helpful, loving suggestions on how the group can develop greater maturity and Improve their Bible study ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Actual-count inventory of literature is to be taken by all congregations on September 1. Two literature inventory forms are being sent to each congregation with the monthly statement. The original should be filled out and returned to the Society </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">no later than September 5.</span><span class="font8"> Retain the duplicate for the congregation’s file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregations are being sent a new chart and a supply of congregation monthly report cards and magazine distributor order blanks. No chart instructions are being sent, as these should be in your file. Congregation servants who have not yet ordered a supply of twelve report cards for each </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font8"> pioneer with the congregation should do so right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All congregations are encouraged to arrange magazine activity on Labor Day, September 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If your congregation is working in unassigned territory endeavor to spend full days in the service. Cover it thoroughly. Follow up all interest. Organize meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the brothers will want to make certain they write letters to Liberian government officials concerning the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Liberia, as suggested in the August 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> if they have not done this already. Congregation servants should particularly check with certain brothers to encourage them to do so. All should appreciate the privilege that is theirs to participate in this important work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Public meetings play a large part in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. They offer people of goodwill a chance to hear a fine discussion of Kingdom truths and build up a desire to study God’s Word. Considerable time and effort are spent by overseers and speakers in preparing for, arranging and delivering these talks. They deserve the wholehearted support of all publishers and goodwill persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> While every publisher should regularly attend to learn new ideas and ways of expressing Kingdom truths as well as to refresh other points in his mind, goodwill people should be helped to see the importance of attending these meetings. In inviting them, merely saying, “Please come,” may not be enough. Often the response is, “If nothing happens I’ll be there,” and then “something happens” to keep them from attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Have you tried using a Scriptural discussion when inviting persons to public talks? For example, you might point out from Hebrews 10:24, 25 that Christians should gather together in meetings, and explain that God’s organization today provides life-giving instruction through such meetings. Arrangements could then be made to come by and pick up the individual, accompanying him to the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Or, have you tried centering your Bible discussion and invitation around the subject to be considered? For example, when the talk “Does God Have a Name?” is to be given, you might discuss briefly why it is important to know the name of the true God, how it is essential to salvation, and so forth, thus whetting the appetite of the goodwill person for the information to be given at the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Bring your Bible, look up the scriptures discussed, and help goodwill people with you to find and read them too. Show your appreciation for this splendid educational feature by regularly attending the public talk each week and by bringing with you people of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">booklets, for $1. October, subscription for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> and three booklets, for $1. Both the October 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> and the October 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> will be special issues for wide distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The name and address of each regular pioneer should be printed, typed or legibly written on the pink monthly report card sent to the Society. Congregation servants should check this before signing the card.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Do you use ti-acts in your ministry? Are you well acquainted with all twelve? Many find them most effective. These handy, brief and to-the-point sermons answer questions on vital subjects and are thought provoking. They can be used effectively on so many occasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For example, when people are busy and do not accept the magazine offer, we could say, “Though you are busy now, you will likely have time in the near future to consider this informative tract. It discusses clearly the hope for peace found in the Bible.” Then give them the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sian’s Only Hope for Peace. </span><span class="font10">Or, if someone objects to our call, saying, “We have heard you are Communists,” we can hand him the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Witnesses, Communists or Christians?</span><span class="font10"> and say, “Contrary to what others have said, you will be interested to read in this tract that since 1879 we have denounced communism and warned the world of its menace.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Hew World </span><span class="font10">has been the most widely used. Often given to busy householders, it concisely expresses the hope we have for a world of righteousness with no sickness, sorrow or death. In areas where considerable prejudice exists, very often a kindly<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">4</a></sup><sup></sup> manner and a timely tract will open the way for future friendly<sup><a href="#bookmark16">4</a></sup><sup></sup> discussions. Many who are infirm have much success witnessing by mail by writing a short letter to a person of goodwill and enclosing a. tract on the subject discussed. At funerals, the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hope for the Dead</span><span class="font10"> is often given out to those who show interest or to all in attendance as an expression of the belief of the deceased. After public talks, a tract bearing on the subject discussed may be given freely to goodwill persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Do you carry tracts with you even when not in Kingdom service? Opportunities often arise to use them when traveling on public conveyances, at work, when shopping, when at the laundromat, or wherever there may be the occasion to strike up a conversation with someone. Excellent experiences are enjoyed by those who carry tracts in their pocket or purse and make the occasion to use them by speaking to others of the Kingdom hope. Use tracts regularly to attract interest and break down prejudice.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN JUNE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though many were attending an assembly or preparing for one, most congregations submitted their report on time, and, all in ali, June’s report was a good one. The Society was very pleased to see that publishers continued to average ten hours, and encourages all to keep up the fine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A feature of our ministry deserving more attention is magazine work, The first ten months of this service year publishers averaged 11.4, pioneers 97.7, and specials 142. If the suggested quotas of 12 for publishers, 100 for pioneers and 150 for specials had been reached, thus far this year publishers would have placed 1,652,360 more magazines, pioneers 254,309 and specials 54,476, which makes a total of 1,961,145. May each one of us resolve to spend sufficient time in magazine service to meet the quotas, as we have in the past.</span></p>

No, because we really love these brothers.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup><a name="bookmark3"></a></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup></sup> In order to assist these persons lovingly we could arrange to take them along with us on another study where </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font10"> is being considered with undedicated persons. In this way newly baptized ones will get the benefit of this basic information and at the same time the field service time can be counted. However, if the above arrangements do not work out, we should individually continue to conduct the study, providing a genuine service of love for our brothers. Perhaps after back-call activity or at any other free time, studies may be conducted with them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Preserving Our Souk Alive by Faithfulness</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We certainly want to be among those who “have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” We are not selfish about this, so we show our love by helping others acquire this life-preserving faith, thereby proving our own faith by faithfulness in the Kingdom ministry. To help us in our ministry we have two fine instruments for building up faith that preserves alive the soul, the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth.”—</span><span class="font11">Heb. 10: 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During this three-month campaign we will offer the two books, with two booklets, for a contribution of $1. If the offer is not accepted, drop to one book, for 50c. If a congregation should temporarily run out of either of the two books, use another bound book that is in abundant supply. It is suggested that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font11"> booklet be placed with the offer, having in mind using it to start a Bible study. As a result of our being Biblestudy conscious, studies have increased so that in September, the first month of the service year, 200,188 Bible studies were reported, and in April, we increased nicely to 230,131. Continue to be Biblestudy conscious, starting studies when the literature is initially placed or on return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We will be using the sermon “Let Your Name Be Sanctified” throughout the two-book campaign; let us learn this sermon well so we can adapt it to our territory and the different people we meet. If your congregation is not doing unassigned territory work, then endeavor to present the offer in territory that is not frequently covered, whether it be city or rural. Overseers should analyze coverage of territory with the magazine-territory servant and select territories in need of attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> To give our territories a thorough witness we will need to be alert to ‘buying out’ time. One way we can do this is to start Sunday morning meetings for field service on time. Some meetings are not being started on time, whereas others often last longer than fifteen minutes. Select a reasonable time and then begin on schedule. Not more than fifteen minutes should be spent Sunday morning discussing the text and covering other pertinent things regarding our ministry. Thereafter we should go right to the territory and begin work. In scattered territory, the one in charge of the group will plan and arrange things so various publishers can be dropped off in more concentrated areas. This will enable all in the group to do the most witnessing within the available time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Now that our young brothers and sisters are on vacation from school, with many of them being vacation pioneers, we will want to check our arrangements for midweek witnessing. It would be well to ascertain from those who are able to engage in midweek witnessing the appropriate days and time, morning or afternoon. Arrange meetings accordingly. In many localities, evenings also are a fine time for calling on not-at-homes and for making return visits to start or conduct Bible studies. If at all possible, support prestudy and back-call night activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“The time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations,” said Peter. Paul instructs Christians to buy out the opportune time for themselves. What better way can this be done than to pioneer? (1 Pet. 4:3; Eph. 5: 16) Our brothers are using their vacations to preach in out-of-the-way places. (74 fl3) Pioneers do much to increase the work done in a congregation. (204 U4) Good organization opened the way for a whole family to pioneer (233 Hl), and it has encouraged young folks to become pioneers. (238 ill) A new high of pioneers was reached in Japan.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In the February issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> the privileges and responsibilities of the congregation overseer in connection with strengthening the service centers were pointed out. Now the role of the assistant congregation servant comes in for consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Because of his maturity the assistant congregation servant, when needed, should be used as a study conductor. Whether he is used as a study conductor or assigned to a particular service center by the overseer, if at all possible he should be placed in a service center where irregularity in the ministry and sermon activity need attention. Being thoroughly familiar with the Publisher’s Record Card file, he is in an excellent position to give personal help to newer publishers in the field. Also, under the direction of the congregation overseer he can line up consistent help for them and others needing assistance through the “assistance arrangement.” The assistant congregation servant can work closely -with the brothers in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> service center for a period of two, three or four months, and in some cases perhaps even longer.

<p><span class="font10">♦ Congregation servants should ascertain the supplies needed by regular pioneers in the congregation and order them, using the regular order blank. Include twelve pink monthly report cards for each pioneer, also weekly record sheets for those who need them. No supplies need be ordered for vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Young brothers and sisters, and all others who can arrange it, are encouraged to vacation pioneer during August. Obtain an application, fill it out and send it in right away.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> And what about the many children at the service centers? Is it reasonable to assume they can have a schedule too? Yes, and the assistant congregation servant will want to encourage and work closely with the parents so that children are helped to follow a reasonable schedule, starting out with regular participation in the magazine work each week. Then the training can be extended to the simplified-sermon activity in due time. Additionally, any publisher experiencing some difficulty in arranging his schedule or making it work, or who may need assistance in the sermon work in any way, should feel free to talk his problem over with the assistant congregation servant. This mature brother will be more than happy to help you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When his work at one service center has shown good results, the assistant congregation servant, under the direction of the overseer, can be transferred to another group needing similar attention. Before leaving the group, he should give a short talk offering practical counsel and helpful suggestions on how the group can continue to develop greater maturity and improve their ministry. Loving encouragement should mark this talk, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Outstanding Issues for Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Plan now for the distribution of two outstanding issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">“Does Your Child Belong to the State?” is the title of an outstanding article in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> of July 22 on legal and religious issues involved in giving blood to children over the protest of their parents. In the same issue: “My Years in Prison in Communist China,” the remarkable experiences of Brother King. Then comes the issue of August 8. It will contain a complete report on the suppression of religious freedom in Liberia and the brutal mistreatment of Witnesses at their recent district assembly. In the same issue is a fine article setting forth our position on the flag salute, which is the issue in Liberia and in many other places today. These issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> are alive with information that will interest the public. Take advantage of the opportunity to place as many as possible. Be sure to order as many extra copies as you can use.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It is a pleasure for the Society to say that almost all unassigned territories will be worked again this summer. Out of 794 unassigned territories 674 have already been assigned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Appreciating that people living in unassigned territory are not often contacted with the Kingdom message, each congregation and pioneer should be diligent to work the territory thoroughly. The offer will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and a book for $1.50, or just books may' be offered. However, the subscription is strongly recommended so that something will be coming to the people regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What can be done where people are not at home and it will not be possible to get back another time? In such cases it would be good to leave a tract, and if old copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> are available, one copy of a magazine could be left at the home where no one answers the door. Slip it under the door or in a place that would be concealed to casual passersby, so if the householder is away on vacation or for any length of time, there would be no danger of the material left indicating to thieves or the like that no one is home. (Note: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">This is only for unassigned territory and is not to he done in any congregation's regularly assigned territory.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In leaving literature at not-at-homes, attach a name card or a neatly handwritten or typed slip informing the householder that the magazines were left since no one was at home. (Or, the special notat-home slip could be used.) The notes could be prepared before going into the territory and pinned on the magazines. Do not scribble on the magazines, for this detracts greatly from the message. Rather, neatly type or write a short note to give a personal touch. Encourage reading the magazines and supply the name and address of the one making the call so householders can write if they desire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The Society would be interested in knowing how many people living in unassigned territory respond to these notes left with magazines. Hence any publishers or pioneers hearing from individuals in unassigned territory should inform the congregation servant. He, in turn, can submit the number of responses with the report he sends to the Society at the end of the campaign. Plan now to work your assignment thoroughly this summer</span></p>

Many persons pray, ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.’ This makes it apparent that God has a name and that his name is to be sanctified. That name is clearly identified for us at Psalm 83:18, which says . . . [Read from Bible.] To aid us to learn more about this name that will soon be sanctified, or cleared of profane use, we are offering this Bible-study aid, ‘Let </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Your Name Be Sanctified,’ </span><span class="font11">along with its companion, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Your Will Be Done on Earth,’</span><span class="font11"> and these two printed Bible sermons on a contribution of $1.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During the first week of this month Jehovah’s people in the Middle West will be enjoying, in Milwaukee, that grand provision of Jehovah’s—the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. The following week our brothers in the East will be assembling at Yankee Stadium to take in the good things provided by the Giver of “every good gift.” —Jas. 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> While little time may remain for attending the assembly in Milwaukee and New York, there is still opportunity to arrange your affairs to attend the assembly in Pasadena, California, September 1-8. As far as it depends upon you, do not miss the Around-the-World Assembly.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Since the convention office is now open in Pasadena, those planning to attend there should send their room requests to Watchtower Convention, 607 North Avenue 64, Los Angeles 42, California.

<p><span class="font11">calling on you and your neighbors in behalf of Bible education. Most Christians pray the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ (or the ‘Our Father’ prayer) and ask for God’s will to be done, not only in heaven but also on earth; isn’t that true? Yet many do not realize what changes this will mean for those who live on earth. I believe that you will enjoy hearing the Bible’s own description of this as given by the prophet Isaiah. [Read Isaiah 2:2-4.] This Biblestudy aid, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Your Will Be Done on Earth,’</span><span class="font11"> will help you to understand further what the fulfillment of this scripture means to us and it points out what God requires of us in order to live in that new arrangement. This study aid, along with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Your Name Be Sanctified,’</span><span class="font11"> and these two printed Bible sermons are yours on a contribution of $1.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The message contained in each of these simplified sermons is simple, yet forceful. Learn them well and be prepared to use them as the occasion suggests.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">room will be assigned and you will be notified by mail. Do not lose sight of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fact, that</span><span class="font11"> this is an eight-day assembly and that the program at each city begins at 9: 45 a.m. on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">opening</span><span class="font11"> day. Also, you will want to send your Volunteer Service slips to Pasadena to help share in the tremendous task of caring for the brothers’ needs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Inasmuch as the Rose Bowl in Pasadena has no covering over any part of it, those attending may find it advisable to bring some protection from the sun, such as appropriate hats or umbrellas.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Congregation servants, remember to order badges and badge holders, as well as bumper signs, as mentioned in the June </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> They are attractively designed to help the brothers advertise while en route and during the assembly. They may also open up opportunities for incidental witnessing, to add to the mounting witness to be given this summer as the assembly goes around the world.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">For the tenth consecutive month we reached a new all-time peak in regular pioneers! This is outstanding, and all who have taken up the pioneer service are to be commended. One year ago our May report showed 6,796 regular pioneers, and now the number has increased to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">8,006,</span><span class="font10"> which reflects the grand number of 1,210 more pioneers in one year. Having in mind that a pioneer does ten times as much field service as an average publisher, you can see that these additional pioneers are in position to do the work of 12,100 publishers. How marvelous this is! The Society is very pleased to see the splendid response to the call for more pioneers and encourages all who can possibly arrange to do so to take up the pioneer service. Rich blessings and thrilling experiences await you in this grand work.</span></p>

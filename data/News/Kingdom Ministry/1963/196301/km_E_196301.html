<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving the Ruler </span><span class="font7">Out of the House of Bread</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a privilege it is to serve the one ■whom Jehovah God has made the Ruler of all mankind I That one, born in Bethlehem in Judea in 2 B.C., has now come forth from a greater Bethlehem, which name means “house (place) of bread.” He has come forth as ruling King. Jesus spoke of himself as “living bread,” and it is from where he thrones in heaven that he administers this “bread,” the life-giving benefits of his ransom sacrifice. How can we serve him? By doing the work that he has commanded for this day: preaching the Kingdom good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The one magazine that is exclusively devoted to announcing that kingdom is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> and during the next four months it is our privilege to share it with others by participating in the twenty-fifth annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription campaign. Our quotas for the campaign are two subscriptions for publishers, twenty for pioneers, and thirty for special pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> How can you meet your quota? First of all, schedule time for house-to-house work with the offer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">every week.</span><span class="font10"> It is here that most new subscriptions are obtained. Also, while principal emphasis will be placed on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription, you may find that excellent results come from offering subscriptions for both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> with six booklets, for $2. When doing this, it is usually more effective to present it to the householder as a subscription for both magazines than to speak of it as two separate subscriptions; though, of course, your report will show two subscriptions. After working with this offer, one full-time publisher wrote: “Up to this year I have always been reluctant to make a presentation of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> on the basis of a double subscription. Only on occasion would I try it. But I placed ten double subscriptions during this campaign and find it very natural to present both magazines for a double subscription.” Why not try it for yourself?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> During the subscription campaign we will use the new sermon “Who Will Survive Armageddon?” How appropriate! It is urgent for people to consider this matter and make a personal decision. Are they going to pursue the course required by God in order to survive? Now is the time to choose. When the battle begins, it will be too late. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will help them to take the steps that lead to survival; encourage them to obtain it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> To assure effective use of the sermon, it is good for family groups</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As discussed in the December </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> ever since circuit and district servants have been giving more personal assistance to the publishers, excellent results have been obtained. These good results, however, have been achieved only where a schedule has been arranged and adhered to by the publishers. To schedule is defined in this way: “To appoint, assign, or designate to</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">do something at a fixed time in the future.” In other words, a schedule is a timetable or program of events, and each one of us having a schedule for theocratic activity will testify to its usefulness and value.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When discussing and arranging a schedule with publishers, overseers will want to get down to basic things and find out the most op-and service companions to prepare and rehearse it together. Then at the service centers, the second Sunday of January, we will review it as a group. The next week we will discuss the simplified sermon; and on the fourth Sunday we will consider sermon introductions and transitions to the offer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">»As we work with the subscription offer, placement of individual magazines should also increase. Since we will be talking about magazines, it will be easier to place the latest copies when the householder does not accept the subscription offer. As publishers obtain their magazine supplies the magazine-territory ser-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col.</span><span class="font10"> 2) portune and advantageous times for each one to serve in the field each week. A schedule that might work for one publisher might be entirely unsatisfactory for another. The main thing- is to work out a practical schedule for some service </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each •week</span><span class="font10"> and then faithfully stick to the schedule that will enable you to reach the ten-hour goal, and share in a balanced Kingdom ministry, including participation in the back-call and Bible study work and magazine activity. How encouraging it is to see many parents working out practical schedules for their children ! As a parent, do you show this loving concern? Children, are you, in turn, cooperating with your parents?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For years the goal of each one’s being a regular publisher has been stressed. Many seem satisfied to put in an hour or so to be considered regular publishers. The right view of our ministry, however, is maximum not minimum service.

<p><span class="font9">20 min: “ ‘Not the Sort That Shrink Back’ When Opposed.” (Talk based on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Jesus was persecuted, so his followers are. (John 15:20) But, having faith, they do not shrink back even when violently opposed. When some suffer from the enemy, fellow Witnesses help them. (222 111) They fight for their legal rights when possible. (249 fi3) When harassed by governments, they do not shrink back. (238 1T3, 262 fll-2, 285 fl2) Threatened with long prison sentences, they do not quit in fear. (299 fi3-300 112) Even when governments campaign to wipe them out, they persevere. (303 fl2; 290-294) Though cut off from the Society, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to preach. (298 fl2-5) And increase continues. (308 fl2) As persons who have faith, Jehovah’s witnesses do not shrink back.—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font9">min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">11 min: New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Reports from literature and accounts servants regarding their visit with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">24 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">min: </span><span class="font9">Demonstration: Aiding Others to Start Bible Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Make prior announcement so publishers will bring copy of “Look!” booklet with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) With only 41 percent of the publishers in the United States sharing in Bible study work there is room for improvement in this vital activity. (Show how local congregation compares with this.) Many more could and should share. Sometimes less capable ones need help in starting studies and sometimes even capable publishers need encouragement in starting studies. Records indicate fine placements on part of some publishers but no studies being conducted. What can be done in these cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (3 min.) Congregation servant talks to Bible study servant about need for more to conduct studies. He has just checked Publisher’s Record cards and found that a number of capable publishers place much literature but do not conduct studies. Has list of some of these. Bible study servant asked which one he would find most convenient to work with this week in aiding and encouraging to share in the Bible study work. Selects Brother Placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (4 min.) Bible study servant approaches Brother Placements. Commends him for regularity in service, attendance at meetings and good placements. With such fine attitude and service record he is undoubtedly desirous of also sharing in Bible study work. He is. What is preventing him? Has been “sort of satisfied” with service accomplishments. Has feeling of inadequacy in starting studies. Knows he should share. Would appreciate suggestions. Bible study servant pleased; discusses joy of conducting studies; mentions success he has had in using new back-call sermon with “Look!” booklet. Would be glad to demonstrate how effective this is on one of Brother Placements’ own placements. Arrangements made for next evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (8 min.) Back-call is made, with Brother Placements enthusiastically renewing acquaintance with householder and introducing Bible study servant, who invites him to get “Look!” booklet, as he “would like to show him some interesting points in it.” Bible study servant calls attention to title of booklet and illustration of a paradise on cover. Points out that title is taken from the Bible and asks the householder to read Revelation 21:1, 4, 5, where it is found. Next, attention is called to short message from “The Publisher” on inside cover. Then refers to questions on paragraphs 1-4, on page 3. Asks householder to read the first four paragraphs, and then questions are asked again and householder is invited to comment. Bible study servant states, “You may wonder on what this description is based. It is not a dreamer’s vision. It is based on Bible scriptures.” Refers the householder to the scriptures on the bottom of page 4, which may be looked up. They suggest householder look up the scriptures in “New World Translation” during the week and they will return to review them so householder may learn more of “the new things that Jehovah has in store.” Arrangements are made for next study and goodbyes are said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE IV (3 min.) On way home Brother Placements expresses appreciation for assistance. Surprised at how easily study was started. Enjoyed entire experience, as it made him appreciate need for being prepared and also how there must be many such persons who would study if more publishers would take hold of Bible study work with enthusiasm. Bible study servant commends him for improved attitude toward Bible study work. Points out that many more in congregation need assistance and soon he can be giving publishers such help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Point out that many more in congregation can share in Bible study work. Takes thought, preparation and appreciation for importance of this feature, but rewards in joy and satisfaction are worth it. Encourage all to share; mature to assist, and less capable to accept this as evidence of loving concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (Cover “Thank You Very Much.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Extension of Training” (Part 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Two enthusiastic servants, study conductors or pioneers discuss from December insert on pioneering, “Pioneering—an Expression of Love.” Audience should have this material with them. Ones discussing this should refer to various paragraphs as they discuss the material thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Presenting the Good News” —discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Isaiah 61:1, 2, bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations that have a fifth service meeting in January will arrange their own program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Theme: Proving Ourselves Approved by Accepting Responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Talk on monthly theme “Proving Ourselves Approved by Accepting Responsibility,” encouraging all to continue sharing in the “Watchtower” campaign. (See “Watchtower,” March 15, 1962, pp. 169-181., also issue of February 1, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">Question-and-answer discussion of article “The Kingdom Hall —Part Four.” Audience asks panel questions. Key points in each paragraph summarized by chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Lovingly Help One Another to Direct New Ones to the Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">vice</span><span class="font10"> for each one of us and achieving the goal of at least ten hours each month. Physical limitations, age and health must, of course, be considered. If a publisher is unable to devote more than a few hours each month, that service is surely acceptable. (Luke 21:1-4) Those who can—and there are tens of thousands who do—will want to spend much more than ten hours a month in the service. When we taste the joy of spending ten hours or more in the field, we will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want </span><span class="font10">to do more, if at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Where publishers work out schedules and stick to them, the alert overseer will commend them. Where publishers continue to need help, he will want to assist them even further. The overseer should make a notation of the ones he has talked to between the visits of the circuit servant and have this list available for the circuit servant when he checks the records on Tuesday. This will enable the circuit servant to know what the overseer has done in regard to this extension of training and which ones the circuit servant should then endeavor to assist.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kingdom Hall—Part Four When New Units Form</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It is a very happy occasion when a congregation reaches the point where it can be divided into two units or congregations. While publishers and pioneers do the ‘planting and watering work,’ Jehovah gives the increase. Great is the joy of a congregation that has been blessed with increase to the point of being divided. Regarding the forming of a new congregation the Society is often asked : Just how should a division of things be made? When a division is made, it is difficult, if not impossible, to divide the equipment on a pro-rata basis. The disposition must be practical and governed by the principle of love. The Society suggests the following arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The original congregation should hold the Kingdom Hall building, with the territory recommendation so set that the Kingdom Hall is</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Starting March 3, circuit servants will give the public talk “Is Your Destiny of Your Own Making?” The new circuit assembly program begins the weekend of February 8 to 10, and district servants will give the talk “Who Will Win the Struggle for World Supremacy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Outlines for the 1963 series of public talks are being sent to each congrega-tion. When they are received, the congregation servant should assign qualified public speakers one or two talks, depending on the number of speakers available. If there are enough speakers, only one talk need be assigned to each speaker. The new series will begin on April 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">^►Beginning January 20, orders may be placed for the 1962 Watchtower and Awake/ bound volumes in English and Spanish. At the same time the 1962 supplement to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font9"> may be ordered. Publishers and pioneers should order through the congregation. Bound volumes are $2 each; the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font9"> 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ A special public talk will be held in all congregations on April 7. More details will be given later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign publishers will remit 90c for each new subscription. Congregations desiring to do so may display a chart showing weekly progress in the subscription campaign, but it should be displayed only at the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The deluxe edition of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> will be out of stock from January 1, 1963, until further notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Beginning with the week of January 13, 1963, those taking the written review in the theocratic ministry school will be permitted to use the Bible. This will make possible a deeper and more satisfying consideration of the many Scripture texts that appear in the material covered by the review. Bring your Bible to school every week and follow closely during the talks so that you will be better equipped for</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">located in the territory of the original congregation. If any indebtedness has not been paid off, the original congregation owning the hall is responsible to continue payments under the arrangements of any loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The new unit or congregation may obtain its own hall, or both may want to use the same hall and thus help defray expenses and materially aid to reduce any mortgages or loans. If a mortgage has not been paid off, consideration should be given to the original congregation, which would be left to pay off the mortgage with fewer publishers to meet the obligation. If the new unit or congregation uses the Kingdom Hall, a regular monthly contribution should be made by them to the original congregation, which will be responsible for paying all bills. It is usually best not to pay “rent,” because of the tax-exempt status of</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NOVEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Distribution of “The Word” booklet was excellent! We placed 1,702,811 booklets, whereas last year’s average monthly booklet placement was 397,848. This means we placed over four times as many booklets in November as in an average month. A tremendous witness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pioneers continue to increase. Another new peak in regular pioneers was reached in November—7,341; wheras in October we had 7,312. More applications are being received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the first time this service year November saw publisher hours drop below ten, down to 9.9, and magazine placements below twelve, down to 10.4. All pioneer activities also dropped. Publishers and pioneers, if the weather is bad, dress appropriately and share fully in the back-call and Bible study field as well as from house to house. Stick to a practical weekly schedule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Supposing the letter below were written to you, what would be youi' reaction? Would you be moved to follow its suggestions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Dear Brother and Sister:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I simply must tell you about something wonderful that happened to me today. You know the young mother with whom I started a study three weeks ago? Well, she and her husband came with me to the public meeting and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study. Everyone made them feel so welcome. They enjoyed it. They said so. I’m so happy I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You understand what a problem it has always been for me to get newly interested ones to come to the meetings and so introduce them to Jehovah’s organization. The servants and the demonstrations always made the whole thing look so easy. But when I went to apply the instruction nothing ever seemed to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the other day I arranged to go with a pioneer brother just to observe his technique. After watching him in action a little while, about the first thought that swept my mind was that I try too hard. He showed me that it is not necessary to have a long, complicated program with many scriptures to arouse a person’s interest. The thing for which to strive is simplicity. Just a couple of Scripture texts, a brief discussion touching on the need of being present at meetings, and, would you believe it?—it worked! It worked for him, and since then it has worked for me too! He has helped me prepare several short sermons, using two or three texts for each from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font10"> booklet, subject heading 28, themes “A” through “E.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another thing I’m doing now that I never did before is this: In my opening and closing prayers I mention the fact that Jehovah has an organization and that it is a grand privilege to be associated with it. These prayerful thoughts have a way of making a lasting impression. I always make sure to speak well of the brothers, the meetings and the love that there is between us, too. We often take these things for granted, but it amazes new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of this has worked so wonderfully for me, I just had to let you know. Why don’t you try it? I’m anxious to hear from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lovingly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Brother Willing</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Simplified “Armageddon” Sermon</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Simplified sermons are effectively being used by Kingdom publishers. Parents are helping their children schedule time for house-to-house work each week, learn a simplified sermon for presenting the current offer, practice it and work with it in the field. Alert publishers use a simplified sermon when people are really busy. Do you? Prepare and use one of the following suggested presentations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> You might say: “Good morning. My name is ----. I am calling be</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">cause of an urgent situation we face. The Bible speaks of a war yet to come called ‘Armageddon.’ It will be God’s war, not man’s. Revelation 16:14, 16 tells us [read verses]. Following this war God’s kingdom will bring peace to this earth. You will undoubtedly want to learn more concerning Armageddon, God’s kingdom and what the future holds. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> can be a great aid The Kingdom Hal! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the hall. These matters will be worked out by the congregation committees and put in writing for the record’s sake. The original unit will have preference in selecting time of meetings, but here again such things will be worked out with love.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If any Kingdom Hall debt is about paid off, or the original congregation is so situated that it can carry the remaining expense without hardship, and the new unit or congregation wishes to use the Kingdom Hall for a while, the original unit lovingly will expect only a small contribution monthly for heat and lighting so the new unit can build up a fund toward obtaining its own hall. If the new unit is going to build a new hall or renovate one, then the original congregation may assist with a contribution of funds, labor, and in other ways, if it is in position to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> With all being guided by the spirit of love, no difficulties will be encountered as these adjustments are smoothly made, resulting in further expansion of Kingdom interests. The original congregation should be just as interested in the new unit to you, as it has been to me. A subscription for one year is only $1.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If people are really busy, you could say: “I will be very brief then. Many have heard the Bible term ‘Armageddon’ and wondered what it means. The Bible shows that Armageddon is God’s war, not a war between the nations. Proverbs tells us [read Proverbs 2:21, 22]. We believe you would like to learn what you can do to survive this coming war of Armageddon and to enjoy the peaceful conditions that follow'. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> can help you. A subscription for a year is only $1.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Prepare well. Have a share in house-to-house work each week. Be enthusiastic in presenting the sermon and the offer, that men of goodwill may learn the good news and join us in presenting it to others. Keep in mind also, after using the regular or simplified sermon, if the offer is not taken to present the two latest magazines.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">vant can encourage all to do this, and he can inquire to see if they will be able to use more magazines during the campaign months. In many cases, too, foreign-language editions of the magazines can be used, if the publishers have them. Be sure that you have ample supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> There is much to be done, and the work is urgent. With urgency, then, let us have an effective share in urging others to submit to the Ruler out of the house of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">as their own, because it is the product of their good works in field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In these days of high prices and shortage of halls to meet in, it is certainly a fine thing for two congregations to use the same Kingdom Hall. It puts the building to more use and helps pay off the indebtedness, and in such cases the territory can be divided so that the Kingdom Hall is near the boundary line of each congregation. If a new Kingdom Hall is built some day, the boundaries of each congregation can be changed so that the Kingdom Halls will be centrally located.</span></p>

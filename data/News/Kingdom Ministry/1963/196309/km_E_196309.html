<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Walk by Faith amid Materialism's Deceptions</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As we begin the new 1964 service year this month, all of us will want to determine to continue improving our service to Jehovah. We are better equipped to do so now than we were a year ago. Not only have we had one more year to progress toward maturity, but on September 8 we will have concluded the stimulating Around-the-World Assembly. How this has enriched us spiritually! Yes, Jehovah continues to provide what we need to aid us toward further growth in the ministry so we can continue walking by faith amid the materialistic deceptions of this old world. —Matt. 13:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Objectives for New Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What is our primary objective for the new service year? It is to take advantage of every opportunity to praise Jehovah and make known the “good news of the kingdom.” All publishers are encouraged to arrange their schedules to shoulder their individual responsibilities as ministers. Included in this is the aiding of others so they too may progress toward Christian maturity. Is there a publisher in the congregation who would be strengthened and helped to grow to maturity if you took a personal interest in him, perhaps helping him to improve his personal study and encouraging him to comment regularly in meetings? Of course there is! Lovingly take the initiative to offer that help. Servants will be glad to offer suggestions on where the most good can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup>1964 can be another year of fine increase, as the brothers return to their congregations encouraged by the recent assemblies, eager to put into practice the things they have learned. All publishers will be interested to know the 10-percent goal for increase in their congregations for the coming year. The new chart will be put up at the end of this month and will show this suggested congregation goal. Take a personal interest in it. Know what your congregation is working toward and then work constructively to help someone with whom you are studying to be included among those who start in the service this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The summer is almost past and children will be going back to school. This means that many sisters will have time to vacation pioneer. Also, with people back from vacation, Bible studies discontinued during the summer months should be resumed. Call on all who were studying before the summer and who, for one reason or another, stopped the study. Their study of God’s Word is vital if they are to meet Jehovah’s approval and be put on the way to life. In addition, try to start new studies with other interested ones. Let each one of us be Bible-study conscious and endeavor to conduct one or more studies regularly during the 1964 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">; OFFER FOR SEPTEMBER ; &lt;&nbsp;“Let Your Name Be Sanctified&quot; and ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> “Your Will Be Done on Earth,&quot; with two booklets, for $ I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">J THEME FOR SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">* ■ Walking by Faith amid Materialism's Deceptions.—Matt. 13:22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> So that the work of assisting others may be properly organized, it would be well for the congregation servant to have a short meeting with all the study conductors. This meeting, which can be held before or after a regular meeting of the congregation, is for the purpose of seeing that all is well organized within each service center so that each one there will receive the needed assistance. Among the points to discuss that will aid the publishers are the following: to see that meetings for field service are functioning as suggested, that midweek activity is arranged for the convenience of many in the group, that the assistance arrangement is in operation, and that the study conductor is calling on all in his group to encourage them to attend the book study, engage in Kingdom service, and attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ten-Hour Goal</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Another goal that should receive attention is that of devoting a minimum of ten hours to the field ministry each month. Every publisher who can will want to arrange a reasonable schedule for this. The goal is surely within reach for many who have not yet attained it, especially when we consider that It means just two and a half hours a week in the ministry. Much fine assistance and encouragement can be rendered by servants and study conductors who will patiently and lovingly help newer and weaker ones to progress toward the goal. They will keep in mind that each publisher has his own routine for the week, and what may be a practical schedule for one may not be so for another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Many publishers are already devoting more time to the ministry than the suggested ten hours, and that is fine. Wherever possible, work diligently toward that reasonable goal. Where it is not possible because of infirmity, old age, family responsibilities or various hindrances, remember, our service to Jehovah is acceptable when we give what we can with the available strength we have. Earnest service, even though limited by circumstances beyond our control, is pleasing to Jehovah, as was the widow’s whole-souled contribution of two small coins. (Luke 21:1-4) However, while it may not be possible for some of us to grow in the quantity of our service, we still want to grow in the quality, increasing in our devotion and integrity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: New World News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article, “Walk by Faith amid Materialism’s Deceptions.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Resuming Bible Studies Stopped During Summer Months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Bible studies increased nicely January through April. During summer months, however, many have stopped due to vacation, children home from school, and publishers being away to assemblies. With things settled down now, assemblies and vacations drawing to a close, children back to school, all should make concerted effort to start studies stopped during summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (8 min.) Bible study servant approaches sister inquiring why no study report was received last two months. Reasons given: Both families on vacation, children home, unending visiting relatives, etc. Goodwill person decided to stop study during summer. Too, sister attended assembly and took vacation. Servant asks when she plans to resume study. Sister replies person of goodwill said she would call when ready, has not yet called. Servant explains publisher should take initiative, as student does not have keen appreciation we have nor does student realize full importance of study. Perhaps her interest has cooled somewhat and must be rekindled. Sister agrees, will call her on phone and suggest, since children are now in school and vacation period is over, why not study again. Servant suggests personal visit would show loving concern for individual and sincere interest in wanting to continue study, would be more effective than phone call. Sister sees value, asks what she would say. Servant suggests she build up enthusiasm for study by sharing assembly highlights, attendance, points that stood out, newspaper clippings, showing some of the releases, etc. Emphasize how assembly stressed importance of Bible study. Get on theme last being studied, review a few highlights, suggest householder get Bible and, that simply, study is resumed. Sister elated over suggestions, says she will try them. Bible study servant desires to know outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Following these suggestions, we will be able to resume many studies that have been discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (6 min.) Sister makes call on goodwill person. Renews acquaintance and incorporates suggestions given above into presentation; scene concludes with study being resumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Studies have fallen off during summer months. Do your utmost to rekindle interest and resume study. The responsibility of assisting sheeplike persons to grow to maturity by regular Bible study is as important as finding them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Cover *‘What Happened Here in July?” and appropriate announcements from Announcements column.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article “Value of Congregation Book Study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Stand Firm, Girded About with Truth. (Two publishers discuss experiences. One needs encouragement and the other uses “Yearbook” experiences to show how Jehovah blesses those who “stand firm.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil seeks to destroy now more than ever. (Rev. 12: 12) Paul advises us to “stand firm, therefore, with your loins girded about with truth.” (Eph. 6: 14) With </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> knowledge of the truth from God’s Word, our brothers and newly interested ones throughout the world are able to resist the Devil and stand firm in many ways. When their apartments and jobs are threatened because of their beliefs, they stand firm. (87 Hl; 67 1(4) When under pressure from wolfish pastors or priests, they are not discouraged, nor do they fear. (131 114; 134 f[2; 194 111) They bear up under government oppression. (289 112-292 1J2) Not even police intimidation can cause them to give up their faith that inspires their grand hope of everlasting life.—264 113, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Talk on “Maintaining Integrity in the Face of Brutal Persecution.” (See “Watchtower,” June 1, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Talk on article “‘Watchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ Special Issues.” 15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of article entitled “Dedicated Publishers, Shoulder Your Responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Analyzing Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each publisher should have his Publisher’s Record card showing year’s totals and averages, also paper and pencil for notes. Congregation chart with correct totals and averages of entire year’s report should be displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Congregation servant discusses congregation record and progress. Service year completed. Time to pause and reflect on progress made, discuss prospects for expansion and how we can individually shoulder our responsibility in the ministry this year. Briefly reviews congregation chart, especially catling attention to yearly averages as compared to goals of 10 hours, 6 back-calls, one study and 12 magazines. Also makes appropriate comments on pioneer activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(16 min.) Brother “Average Publisher” with Publisher’s Record card in hand first talks with congregation servant; his averages reflect exactly the congregation averages. Together he and congregation servant compare his Publisher’s Record card with goals shown above. If congregation average is ten hours or more, they may discuss how a schedule helped him to meet this average; if below ten, they discuss what can be done to work out a practical schedule to build up activity. Next, Bible study servant follows same procedure in discussing back-call and Bible study activity. Where back-call average is low, “Average Publisher” can be shown how he could meet goal by supporting back-call-night arrangement, third hour on Sunday, keeping accurate house-to-house records of placements, making definite appointments to call back, etc. Where study average is low, it can be shown that study was not kept going, was not held with people regularly each week, and for this reason some months study was not held. Whatever local circumstance is that has kept publishers from averaging one study, “Average Pub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Usher”</span><span class="font8"> can be shown what to do to overcome this weakness. Magazineterritory servant then discusses with him magazine work and makes appropriate observations and suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(5 min.) Congregation servant discusses how many new publishers there were during the past year, how many became inactive, how many were baptized. Many new and inexperienced ones need help. None should be allowed to become inactive. Discusses need for keeping ministry progressive and productive. Commends publishers and pioneers for good work in past and encourages all to apply suggestions given to Brother “Average Publisher.” Make 1964 service year successful by shouldering own load of responsibility and helping others who need aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan, based on Galatians 6: 5, at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Take Courage to Preach God’s Nearby Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower,” October 15, 1962, pp. 612-624, also issue of October 1, 1963.) 15 min: Know Your October 8 “Awake!” (Magazine-territory servant discusses highlights of magazine and has several publishers give model presentations. Concludes with encouragement for all to share in distribution of special “Awake!”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Presenting the Good News —discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Walk by Faith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> How can publishers of school age reach this goal of ten hours a month? True, more of their time will be occupied now that school has resumed, but by working out a good schedule with their parents and then sticking to it they will successfully reach that goal. Time can be spent in the field service after school or on weekends to meet the goal of ten hours a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others Break Free</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> The publications </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font9"> will aid many to break free from the entanglements of the old world. Sheeplike ones will need to be assisted to pursue New World interests, so continue offering these fine publications during September. However, it would be well to have a book other than these available, so where householders already have these another can be offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Increase your love for Jehovah and for his work on earth during 1964. Pay attention to improve your ministry as the year progresses. By doing this, you and those you assist will be strengthened to walk by faith even though surrounded by the deceptions of this materialistic old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Dedicated Publishers, Shoulder Your Responsibility</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Having dedicated our lives to Jehovah and the doing of his will, there is only one direction in which we want to go and that is forward. Having received a commission from God, each one of us should have an overwhelming desire to fulfill it. That this duty falls upon each one individually Paul indicates when he says, “Each one will carry his own load.”—Gal. 6: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Before us lies the new service year with all its grand prospects for expansion. What an appropriate time not only to determine how we can individually shoulder more responsibility but also to make definite plans for doing so! What should those plans include? For each member of the family it should mean participation in door-to-door work with effective sermons and sharing fully in magazine work so that the territory is covered adequately and the meek are given the opportunity to hear. Further, it becomes our grand privilege to call back on all interested persons found and cultivate this interest so that Bible studies can be started. Finally, it means conducting Bible studies with a purpose; teaching so that accurate knowledge is imparted and new ministers begin serving.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Does shouldering your own responsibility mean receiving no help or encouragement? Not at all. In fact, assisting others is an additional responsibility to shoulder. How happy we should be to receive loving assistance from our brothers from time to time I Therefore, always welcome the assistance of the circuit servant, the district servant, the congregation servant and others in regard to making up a practical schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Undoubtedly, family heads will want to work out family schedules, and proper training of children will be cared for in conformity with 1 Timothy 5: 8. Responding to this loving assistance, new publishers should determine to move out from the “babe” class as quickly as possible and expand their ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> All of us have real cause to be optimistic as we apply ourselves to the work ahead. Every year sees advancement and increase in the New World society, and Jehovah’s blessing continues richly upon his people for progress. With this prospect before us, may we individually shoulder our responsibilities during the 1964 service year, resulting in increased praise to Jehovah and continued growth toward maturity individually.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Value of Congregation Book Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It is good for all of us to stop and think what a loving provider Jehovah is in so many ways. For example, consider the congregation organization. There is a central meeting place at the Kingdom Hall; yet, in addition, Jehovah has wisely and lovingly arranged for an extension of this arrangement throughout the congregation’s territory. How so? By arranging for congregation book studies and service centers at convenient locations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> With congregation book studies wisely located throughout the congregation’s territory, the largest number of publishers and persons of goodwill are able to attend regularly. Each one who does so is greatly aided to progress in knowledge and to press on to maturity. Since the study groups are kept small, there is frequent opportunity to comment, to be built up and to build others up. Regular attendance at the congregation book study will also aid us to be more proficient in conducting our own home Bible studies. How is this? Because the procedure followed at the congregation book study is the pattern that each one should follow in conducting effective home Bible studies with persons of goodwill.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> As a service center, this arrangement is without equal. Here is a location where all in the vicinity can conveniently meet for field service, and this with a minimum of time and expense for traveling. Each one associated should make it his goal to have some share in every feature</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">&amp; It is suggested that publishers place at least 10 copies of the special October 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> and 10 copies of the special October 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font8"> If the usual three copies of each of the other two issues in the month are placed in addition, this means a total of 26 magazines placed for the month of October. Pioneers are urged to place 50 of each special issue, meaning a total of 150 magazines for the entire month. Special pioneers should endeavor to place 65 of each special issue, for an overall total of 205 magazines for the month of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Circuit servants report that many congregations do not order their special issues early enough, and some not at all. If the order is sent in late, then the magazines will arrive late and may not be used to full effectiveness as new issues may be out by that time. Congregation servants should consider what their congregation goals are for the month and order enough in time to be certain that publishers and pioneers will have enough special issues and will not be discouraged by a lack of magazines.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">of the ministry each week. The convenient location of the service center and personal assistance by the study conductor and others made available here make this possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> All who attend are benefited by the 45-minute public talks that are arranged every month or two. When properly organized by servants, and advertised and supported by publishers, splendid attendance has resulted. It is thrilling to bring a person of goodwill to a talk or to the study. Often it is the first contact new ones have with congregation meetings of the New World society. All in attendance at the study should make every effort to assist persons of goodwill to attend these talks. Build toward this by taking others from the service center with you to your Bible studies, thus gradually getting those goodwill persons acquainted with different ones who attend the study. This will make it easier for them to come to the 45-minute talks or to the regular studies when the invitation is extended to them. When such new ones begin attending, how important it is for each of us to demonstrate warmth and friendliness, especially toward these new ones!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> With all of us appreciating Jehovah’s provision of the congregation book study, we will take advantage of the benefits to be derived by our regular attendance and participation in all of its meetings and field service arrangements. Thus we will be helped to fulfill our responsibilities in the work Jehovah has given us to do. At the same time we will be helping others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Literature offer: October, subscription for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> and three booklets, for $1. November, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,</span><span class="font8"> and a booklet, for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ On the second Sunday of September the current sermon will be reviewed at the morning meeting for field service at all service centers. The third Sunday the simplified sermon will be analyzed. On the fourth Sunday all centers will discuss how Bible studies can be started on the initial placement of literature, or when this is not possible, how arrangements can be made for a return visit to start the study. On the fifth Sunday of September common objections met in the territory will be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ For the benefit of French-speaking persons we are pleased to announce that there will be an all-French assembly in Quebec, Canada, September 2629, 1963. None of the program will be in English. The assembly will be held at “La Batisse Industrielle,” Terrain de 1’Exposition, Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. Requests for rooms should be sent to Watch Tower Convention, 466, rue Saint-Georges, Trois-Rivieres, Quebec.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With Sermon Designed for “Awake!” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> During October we will have the opportunity to use the new sermon, set out below, w’hich will undoubtedly prove to be very effective. It will be especially appropriate for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Appreciating the God of Creation</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Ps. 37:10, 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> After introducing ourselves we might say, “It’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a nice</span><span class="font9"> day, isn’t it? A day like today makes a person want to be out enjoying the marvels of creation, doesn’t It? That was the way the psalmist felt when he wrote the 19th Psalm, which Is part of the Holy Bible. Apparently he appreciated the works of creation and gave credit for them to God. Notice how beautifully he puts it. [Read Psalm 19:1.] Really, all things created, whether heavenly or earthly, testify to the existence of a Creator and make the God-fearing-man stand in awe and wonder. And when one appreciates God for his marvelous works, he puts himself</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> During October, special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> issues will aid honesthearted ones to see Jehovah’s works and appreciate their meaning. The special October 8 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> emphasizes “Learning from the Marvels of Creation.” It shows how stars and atoms, animals and plants, earth and sea, all testify to the power, harmony and love of our Creator. It identifies the One who made it all and points out what He requires of mankind. What a fine issue to use in obtaining subscriptions during the October campaign!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The special October 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> contains the public talk “When God Is King over All the Earth,” delivered at the Around-the-World Assembly. What upbuilding and delightfully simple information to get into the hands of the public! In addition, this issue will contain an article on the assemblies in position to learn more about God himself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> “The book of Psalms not only encourages us to appreciate God’s creation but goes on to identify just who that God is. Notice how Psalm 104:24 identifies him by name. [Read verse.] Yes, it is the Almighty God, Jehovah, who is properly given credit for all these marvels of creation that we enjoy today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> “Of course, there are some undesirable things in this earth that we would like to see eliminated, and Psalm 37:10, 11 shows that this will take place. [Read verses.] When this does take place, then we can enjoy living as God purposed that we should.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> “Because God created such a wonderful earth for man to live on and guaranteed that someday only meek ones will inhabit the earth, we should show appreciation and learn what he says in his Bible concerning it.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN JULY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While many were attending- the “Everlasting- Good News” Assemblies in Milwaukee and New York during July as well as enjoying vacation periods, the Society was pleased to see that the country as a whole averaged 9.1 hours per publisher. This was fine in view of the busy schedule so many families had during this period, and we commend you for your faithful activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, of course, we will want to get back into a pattern of regular field ministry and resolve to have a workable weekly schedule so we can make the ten-hour goal each month. Regular and special pioneers will want to work out a practical schedule that will enable them to spend 100 and 150 hours respectively in field service each month. If you are having some difficulty in working out a schedule, whether a publisher or a pioneer, do not hesitate to talk to your circuit servant, congregation overseer or study conductor about receiving some help in this regard. These brothers will be more than happy to help you, and time and again it has been proved that a good schedule, adhered to on a weekly basis, produces results. May Jehovah continue to bless you individually as you put Kingdom interests first in your lives.</span></p>

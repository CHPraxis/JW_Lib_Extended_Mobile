<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Take Courage to Preach God's Nearby Kingdom</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Christians need courage to preach God’s established kingdom. This courage comes from a knowledge of God’s purposes as found in his Word and with the help of God’s holy spirit. Persons of honest heart need to learn these things step by step. A valuable aid toward this end is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazine. And how </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> circulation has grown! Ten years ago it first reached the one-million mark. Now the circulation has climbed to 3,800,000! Contributing to this increase has been the annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">subscription campaign, as last year 176,349 subscriptions were obtained during October, the highest total ever, surpassing the previous high of 173,549 obtained during October, 1959.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What will this October’s report show? Will we do as well as last year or even better in our use of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> to publicize the Kingdom? There are many things we can do to work toward exceeding last year’s excellent report: (1) prepare well the fine new sermon so as to use it skillfully; (2) regularly engage in the door-to-door work each week with the subscription offer, spending a minimum of two hours in this feature of service; (3) offer subscriptions to persons with whom you conduct Bible studies; (4) call back right away on expired subscription slips; (5) offer the subscription to those on your magazine route; (6) speak to friends and relatives about subscribing; (7) offer it to tradespeople who call at your home or with whom you deal. Yes, if we use these and other means of placing subscriptions we will individually reach the goal of one subscription for each publisher, five for pioneers and eight for special pioneers during the month. This will enable us to exceed last year’s fine total for the entire country. We can also be alert to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscription where the householder already subscribes for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> Of course, where the householder has neither, publishers who desire may offer both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscriptions, with six booklets, for $2. Also, so that all can share in the subscription work, a simplified sermon has been provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As an aid to placing subscriptions, the Society has provided the excellent October 8 and October 15 special issues. Publishers should endeavor to place 10 of each of these and the usual number of the other two issues, making a total for the month of 26. For pioneers it is suggested that they place 50 copies of each special issue and the regular number of the other issues, making a total of 150. Special pioneers are encouraged to place 65 of each special issue. With the reg-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A Look of the 1963 Service Yeor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Reviewing the 1963 report, there is much for which we can be grateful. True, we got off to a slow start in publishers, but by December there was a 5.1-percent increase, with 281,108 publishers in the field. Then, in March, 281,545 participated in the ministry, paving the way to the excellent April report of 308,370 ministers in the field—a 15.3-percent I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR OCTOBER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">j &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscription for “Awake!”, with</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">three booklets, for $1. i</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark0"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">| Take Courage to Preach God's ( ) Nearby Kingdom.—Ps. 31:24</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">increase. For the service year, an average of 280,052 publishers engaged in the service each month—■ a 5-percent increase for the year and an average of 12,616 more publishers in the field each month. What cause for rejoicing!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> With this splendid increase in publishers, we averaged 9.8 hours per publisher, putting in 44,572,990 ular number of the other issues distributed, their magazine placements for the month would be 205. These goals can be reached by all if we make it a point to spend at least one day in magazine work each week. If you are not able to support the regular congregation Magazine Day, then arrange a magazine day of your own during the week. Also, support prestudy work and endeavor to place magazines when the regular subscription offer is declined.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Courageously continue the fine activity of previous </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> subscription campaigns. Take the words of life in printed form to life seekers so they too can take courage from a knowledge of God and his purposes and can put faith in him and his nearby kingdom.—Ps. 31: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">hours, compared to 41,379,040 hours last year. Our back-call average was 3.3, the same as last year; so there is room for improvement here as each one of us works for the reasonable goal of six back-calls each month. Bible studies enjoyed a splendid increase from 198,921 last year to the record 210,918 this year. Keep up the fine work in this respect, brothers, for it is from the Bible study work that expansion results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For the first time in the U.S. we placed over 50,000,000 magazines in a year, actually 50,584,964, compared to 47,801,989 last year. However, our average dropped from 11.6 in 1962 to 11.4 in 1963. Individually, then, each one should firmly resolve to try to place three magazines each week and, undoubtedly, by being magazine conscious, this goal can be accomplished. Outstanding was the number of new subscriptions this year, 877,705 compared to 818,041 last year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of Congregation Organization article “Importance of the Congregation Book Study. How to Conduct the Study (Part 1).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Report from assistant congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Developing Magazine Routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Placements of magazines open up many opportunities to start a magazine route. Publishers and pioneers who have routes consistently meet or exceed suggested goals. It is simple to start a magazine route, for all one has to do is keep a house-to-house record of magazine placements, putting down (1) householder’s name; (2) address; (3) date of visit; (4) issues placed. The article featured may also be noted if publisher wishes to refer to it on next call. Publishers and pioneers are encouraged to start magazine routes as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (6 min.) Magazine-territory servant talks with publisher whose magazine placements fluctuate greatly. Servant notes that some months publisher has excellent magazine placements, and others, only a few. Publisher supports Magazine Day activity quite regularly but comments that placements vary greatly. Sometimes a goodly number are placed, and at other times, few or none. Servant asks if publisher would like to know where people are in the territory who will regularly take magazines. Publisher enthusiastically replies, “Yes.” Servant explains how this is done through a magazine route. Foundation is laid when magazines are first placed. All that is necessary is a House-to-House Record with householder’s name and address, date of visit and issues placed. Return in two weeks with latest magazines, calling attention of householder to an appealing article and offer current magazines to householder. This arrangement enables one to know where magazines can be placed in territory. Publisher is enthusiastic about idea. Would appreciate going with the magazine-territory servant to see how it </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Emphasize simplicity of arrangement, keeping of an accurate House-to-House Record sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (6 min.) Magazine-territory servant, working along with publisher, makes offer, places magazines. Tells householder that he will return in two weeks to see how journals were enjoyed and to deliver latest issues. Thereafter makes out House-to-House Record. He explains to publisher that wherever magazines are placed he will make a notation and call in two weeks with the new issues. Publisher sees merit of arrangement. Will do this hereafter. Would like to accompany servant as he now makes calls on his route. Servant introduces himself to householder, calling householder by name and says, “I have come to bring you your latest issues of 'The Watchtower’ and ‘Awake’’ In this issue there is an appealing article [select one]. I know you will enjoy these copies.” Householder takes magazines. Publisher is impressed, will apply suggestions and start route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Routes must be kept progressive. Some may drop out. Others will be added as additional territory is worked. Ones who show much interest can be helped through regular back-calls. Not only those who take magazines on Magazine Day may be included in routes, but those who take magazines at other times, such as when regular offer is not taken and magazines are placed. Be ever conscious of noting magazine placements, starting routes and keeping such going by means of maintaining regular magazine activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Women Are “Telling the Good News” as Pioneers. (Give talk and have sisters discuss points made in 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Women in ancient times praised Jehovah. There were Miriam the prophetess, Deborah, Elizabeth and Mary, and a host of others who honored Jehovah with praises. In fact the psalmist was moved to write: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army.” (Ps. 68:11) And they are a large army today telling the good news as pioneers. Mothers are setting good examples for their daughters to follow. (252 UI) Others have reared families and are still pioneering. (260 UI; 102 Jf3) A mother of eight has had fine results. (105 fll) Sisters have scheduled their activities, and have used vacations and worldly holidays to improve their praise to Jehovah. (146 1J1&gt; They have increased their placements and studies. (211 112) Are you one increasing your praise to Jehovah? Increase your joy by pioneering.—253 1J1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Briefly develop sermon for the congregation, discussing introduction, body and conclusion as set forth below. Show how book “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained” can be effectively used in sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: God’s Purpose for Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suggested introduction: “Good morning. I am one of a group of Christian workers calling briefly to help thinking persons understand God’s purpose for man. Many wonder in this day and age just what God’s purpose is for man, whether he even cares about what is happening on earth. We usually have a purpose in mind when doing things, don’t we? [Let him reply.] Likewise, it is reasonable to expect that God has a purpose for man, and he does. To know what his purpose is helps us to appreciate why we are here and what there is to live for in the future. God’s original purpose for mankind is clearly expressed here at Genesis 1:28.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Genesis 1:28—Made earth paradise to be filled with perfect humans. Page 25, paragraph 26, of “Paradise” book gives talking points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Turn to pages 20-21, saying, “Here’s an illustration of what that paradise was like,” and place book in householder’s hands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Briefly comment on illustration; then say, “As we know from reading Genesis chapter 3, that paradise was lost as a result of disobedience on the part of Adam and Eve. Did it mean that God’s purpose for a paradise failed? Do you think it will ever be restored ?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Isaiah </span><span class="font9">55:11—Positive assurance God’s purpose will come to pass. Page 25, paragraph 27, for talking points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. Psalm 37:10, 11—Earth will be filled with perfect, peaceful humans. Page 222, paragraphs 11-13, for talking points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">6. Ask householder to turn to page 241. Comment on illustration and pose question, “How will this paradise be restored?” Answer: “The Kingdom we pray for, as Jesus taught and as recorded at Matthew 6:9, 10.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Conclusion: “Now is the time to learn more about God’s kingdom and his purposes for man. This publication has helped thousands to understand from the Bible what one must do to live in this regained paradise. You may have the copy that is in your hand for a small contribution of 75c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (5 min.) Well-rehearsed presentation of sermon to demonstrate its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Publishers may choose to wait until end of sermon before introducing the book. When book is introduced attention can be directed to pages 20-21, and, after brief comment, turn to page 241 for conclusion. Draw householdex* into conversation for best results. Start studies on initial call wherever possible. Keep an accurate house-to-house record and arrange for return calls, having in mind starting Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A heavy responsibility rests upon those who teach the Word of Jehovah. How true this is of congregation book study conductors! Qualified conductors not only make the study interesting and helpful but also do a great deal to bring the group on to greater maturity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Following prayer on opening the study, the conductor will take two or three minutes to review the material considered the previous week, doing so by summary or by asking pertinent questions. While brief, this opening review, if conducted properly, is very profitable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Who should read at the congregation book study? A qualified, dedicated brother who is advised of the assignment at least a week in advance. Sisters can be used if no qualified, dedicated brothers, other than the conductor, are present. A non-dedicated person may be used to read if no qualified, dedicated reader is available.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Commenting at the book study is a grand privilege. Of course, this requires preparation on the part of all attending-. If some seem</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ Early in October the congregation servant will meet with the assistant to discuss suggestions for the assistant congregation servant to work with service centers as outlined in the July </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> The assistant will make a list of inactive publishers and those who have become irregular.

<p><span class="font10">to have difficulty in expressing themselves, the conductor can break the question down into its simplest parts and then each one, even the children, can share in the study, to his benefit. Additional questions may be asked in order to bring out all the desired points in answer to the printed question, to tie in the chapter theme or to emphasize the practical value of the material under discussion. Some conductors may want to assign certain paragraphs or portions of paragraphs to those who desire assistance. Never should the conductor put any of the brothers on the spot, or embarrass new ones by calling on them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Long Scripture passages do not always need to be read in their entirety. Conductors may assign such to competent brothers in advance and they may epitomize them, making application of the material to the study. Or, certain parts of long passages may be assigned to different persons. Other scriptures, cited but not quoted, should be looked up by all in attendance. The conductor will call on various ones to read these scriptures and thereafter comment on them. These arrangements will help each one to use the Scriptures more effectively.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">Shoulder Your Responsibility —As a Publisher</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is the greatest privilege that could be extended to a human today? To be a servant of Jehovah, representing him as a publisher of the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Those new in the service should have their hearts and minds set on the same goals as those older in the truth. True, they may not be as effective in the service as the more mature ones, but they can steadily improve. For example, it may be necessary for them to use the simplified sermon at first, but with experience and assistance they can soon be using the full sermon. They should appreciate that being a teacher requires becoming proficient in the magazine activity, in the back-call work and in conducting- Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> All of us should have regularity in the service as a goal. The best way to be certain of regularity in the service is to have a schedule. A schedule calling for two and a half hours of field service each week, or ten hours each month, has been found to be reasonable, and many have this as a minimum.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> We also want to be balanced in all things. A schedule that includes all the various features of the ministry will make for balance in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Shouldering responsibility as a publisher means working alone as much as possible where this Is practical. Twice as much is accomplished when publishers work alone. Of course, where conditions make it hazardous for publishers, especially sisters, to work alone, then working in pairs is strongly recommended.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>e</sup> Surely we appreciate and enjoy all the provisions made for assisting us to keep integrity and serve actively. It also gives us great satisfaction when we are personally able to shoulder our own responsibility as a publisher and equip ourselves to assist others.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Tens of thousands of new publishers began preaching the good news last year. No doubt some are associated with your congregation. In addition, there are over 60,000 publishers in the United States who are fifteen years of age or under. Some of these are probably associated with your congregation too. Are these new and younger publishers being assisted to be effective in the witness work by using the simplified sermon? We can show love for our children and for those young in the truth by helping them prepare and effectively use the simplified sermon. All publishers can use it to good advantage when people are really busy.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">The Pioneer's Role in the Congregation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> AU regular and special pioneers received a letter from the Society dated September 13, 1963, outlining and clarifying the important role pioneers play in the congregation. District servants, circuit servants and congregation committees received a letter under the same date showing what they can do to aid pioneers to serve effectively in the congregation. By now each pioneer and committee should have carefully considered the material, and it is suggested that, not later than October 31, the committee and all pioneers meet together and arrange to put these suggestions into practical operation in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Pioneers are an integral part of the congregation and should work closely with it. Pioneers are in a position to do ten times as much work as an average publisher. Therefore, committees and circuit and district servants will want to work closely with pioneers in regard to the expansion of Kingdom work locally. What can be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> First of all, to be a successful pioneer and in a position to help build up the congregation, a good the biggest changes man will ever see was foretold in the Bible at Psalm 37:10, 11. [Read.] God has made this promise and he will accomplish it. You will want to learn how God will rid the earth of wickedness and bring peace. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazine will keep you awake to these changing times and the establishment of God’s new world of righteousness. A subscription for a year can be yours for only $1.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Parents will want to begin now to help their children prepare this brief presentation. Then work with them each week in the service. Those giving personal assistance to publishers new in the truth will want to help and encourage them too. With proper preparation and aid in the field, young ones and new publishers will soon be able to reach the goal of being able to work alone while skillfully presenting the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">schedule is necessary. Pioneers who wish assistance with a schedule, or whose activities are low, can talk to one of the servants, who will be pleased to be of assistance in working out a schedule that will help the pioneers meet their requirements. Also, if a pioneer wishes assistance to build up magazine placements, back-call or Bible study service, he should feel free to approach other pioneers, publishers or servants for suggestions and help in the field. Many pioneers have been helped by this means to mature and become efficient in the ministry, resulting in many benefits to the congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Not infrequently pioneers have written the Society stating that they become discouraged from working alone so often in field service. The Society’s letters point out how the overseer can help by making arrangements for field service during the week and by encouraging publishers to work in territories with pioneers. Publishers and pioneers, encourage and assist one another to share in the service for mutual benefits. This will build up the congregation greatly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps the greatest thrill of the 1963 service year was watching the pioneer ranks Increase from month to month. On the average, 11,130 pioneers (including vacation pioneers) were in the field each month in 1963, compared to 9,323 in 1962. This is a 19-percent increase, which is marvelous, indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Considering the excellent attendance of 491,375 at the Memorial this past year, our potential for increase is very great. Armed with the splendid information from the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, surely each one of Jehovah’s people is in the best position ever for faithfully and zealously proclaiming Jehovah’s kingdom and working for further increase.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> With the fast-approaching end of this system of things facing us, there are compelling reasons for never failing our God, who has commanded that the good news be preached in this time of the end. For others to benefit fully from the good news, we know that they need God’s Word in understandable form. Certainly we have that in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font12"> the English edition, which we are offering for $1, and the Christian Greek Scriptures, available in Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and German, which we may offer for 50c, along with a booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now that we have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> in these many languages, we eagerly want to make the most of our opportunities. Are there people who read Spanish, Italian, German or one of the other languages in our territory? Then we should have on hand the Bible in their languages. Jehovah has blessed ns with these translations; let us use them. Past experience has shown that it is not difficult to place the Bible, especially if we give the householder an example of the clear rendering of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nezv World Translation</span><span class="font12"> by using the leaflet “Renderings of Scriptures Compared.” Placements go up tremendously when we offer the Bible at every appropriate opportunity, to fellow employees, neighbors, salespeople, yes, to whomever we meet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If we use a deluxe edition of the Bible in giving our sermon at the door, some householders might expect a similar copy for $1; so we may find it advantageous to use the regular edition when demonstrating the Bible, On the other hand, some persons may want the deluxe edition for $2.50. When you meet people who have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font12"> offer them a copy of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font12"> book for 75c. Whether placing a Bible or a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font12"> book, we will leave them a booklet and try to start a study in it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Working for the 10-Percent increase</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If we could see a 10-percent increase in December, that would make us all very happy. What can we do to attain such fruitage in our ministry? Starting with ourselves, we should be out in the ministry and report not later than December 15. If we all do this we will be working toward the goal of having 100 percent of the publishers in each service center group out in the ministry. Each week the assistant congregation servant will give to the study conductors a list of those not reporting. These will be assisted by servants and other mature publishers who will</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> One of the tine provisions for improving service effectiveness and building up spirituality in the congregation is tire circuit servant’s visit. So that even greater assistance can be rendered to the brothers individually and the congregation as a whole, some adjustments are being made in the circuit servant’s schedule, effective January 1, 1964.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">day morning and afternoon service. Wednesday evening, instead of visiting a book study, the circuit servant will work with the congregation servant, making calls on publishers who have become irregular or inactive or who have problems. The congregation servant will schedule two or three calls. If no publishers are in need of assistance, the two brothers will engage in back-call and Bible study work. The pubhelp these brothers work out a schedule to participate in the ministry in December.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In helping our brothers in this time of the end, it would be a very kind provision if, following the meeting for field service Saturday and Sunday, the study conductors and assigned publishers would take a little time to stop by the homes of those who have not been out by the 15th, inviting them to share in the ministry that day. It may be that many can share in the service that very day but will need a little time to get ready, so we can work in the immediate area, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font12"> 2) lishers will do their regular back-call and Bible study work, with the circuit servant’s wife accompanying one or more sisters in the evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Thursday evening all service centers will have their regular book study at 8 p.m., with prestudy service at 7 p.m. The circuit servant will attend one of the studies, engaging in prestudy work with the study conductor. Friday morning and afternoon meetings for field service will be from the study location attended by the circuit servant or whatever location the congregation servant feels will be most convenient for those going out in service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Presenting the Good News —discuss and demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Concluding comments. (Cover “What Happened Here in October?” and remarks on slogan, based on Isaiah 55:11, on bottom of page 8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER </span><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: New Theocratic Ministry School Schedule—talk by school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Shoulder Your Responsibility —Helping New Ones in the Service. (Question-and-answer discussion.) 18 min: Ten-Percent Increase—Our Goal in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) To reach a 10-percent increase much encouragement and personal assistance are needed. Where necessary, call on publishers at their homes to encourage them and invite them into the service. Conductors can use the help of other mature publishers in the service center, if necessary, to help each one share in the ministry this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (10 min.) Conductor talks to sister who is willing to help others. “What should I do and what should I say?” she asks. Conductor points out: (1) Go to the home of the publisher. (2) Let him know that this month we are making a special effort to place the New World Translation Bible and we would like him to share. (3) Discuss simplified presentation using John 17:3. (4) Make appointment to work together in service. Sister observes she can easily do this and it will be a pleasure to offer such assistance. Demonstrate: Sister makes call, follows suggestion of study conductor and arranges to work with publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) In addition to making it our goal to help each publisher share, we will want to start new ones in service. How can publisher conducting studies with ones ready for service invite them to share?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (3 min.) At end of study publisher draws householder out on how “New World Translation” has aided greatly in understanding the truth. Publisher explains that Bible is being offered from house to house by Jehovah’s witnesses this month and many new ones will share, using simplified sermon. Publisher demonstrates how Bible is offered, using simplified sermon with John 17:3. Invites householder to share in Godgiven work. Gives written copy of what to say and encourages student to practice it. Definite arrangements for service are made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Are You Answering the Call to Pioneer?—question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Report from magazine-territory servant based on meeting with congregation servant, with suggestions on how magazine placements can be increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Starting More Home Bible Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) The number of Bible studies being conducted is increasing nicely. It is also pleasing to see more publishers sharing in this feature of service. So even more can share in Bible study work, ones in assistance arrangement will want to start studies for those they assist, doing so when literature is placed or on return visit. Let’s continue to be Bible-study conscious and start studies at every opportunity. Note how this mav be done on initial call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (7 min.) Publisher concludes sermon with John 17:3, places Bible and “This Good News of the Kingdom” booklet. He opens booklet to message on inside cover and points out value of examining source of good news, the Bible. Reads to householder question 2(b) on page 3 and uses points in paragraph 2 to emphasize value of gaining sure hope from Bible. Discusses paragraphs 4 and 5 with householder. Arranges to return at definite time next week to continue discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) If no study started on initial call, follow up placement of Bible and booklet promptly, using simplified back-call sermon. How can a publisher not conducting a study be assisted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (7 min.) Mature publisher discusses with less experienced publisher need of starting studies. He explains how easy return visit is, requiring only the use of a scripture or two to get into the “Good News” booklet. Less experienced one asks to be shown. Mature one demonstrates, using less experienced one as householder. States, “You will recall the scripture at Revelation 21:3, 4 we talked about last week. Conditions that will come on earth in the future under God’s kingdom were described. This is good news. In the booklet left last week, ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ this good news is further explained.” Brings out copy, reads question on paragraph 3, then discusses and reads paragraph. Does same with paragraph 4. (Chairman breaks in—paragraphs 5 and 6 or more may be covered, depending on householder. See how arrangements are made for continuing study.) Mature one concludes, making definite arrangements to continue discussion following week. Less experienced publisher feels he could do this, it is not hard at all. Mature publisher will practice with him and go along on a call so that less experienced one may be fully equipped to start studies in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Whether sermon is used to start studies or not, young and old, new and experienced publishers may share in the joyous work of conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower” of January 1, 1963, also January 1, 1964.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Adjustments in Visit of Circuit Servant.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Develop sermon with congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Will Sincerity Alone Please God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Suggested presentation: “Good morning. My name is -----. I am calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">on all sincere people this morning to discuss briefly what is necessary to please God. Most agree that sincerity is necessary, and it is; but will sincerity alone please God? Very likely you have heard people say it makes no difference what you believe as long as you are sincere. On the other hand, many say a person may be very sincere and still be wrong. Thus the question, Who is right? Those who say sincerity is enough or those who say more is required? [Give householder opportunity to comment.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“At Matthew 7:21 Jesus clearly states that more than sincerity is necessary. [Read and comment.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Another striking example that shows that sincerity is not enough is found at Jeremiah 32:35. [Read and make appropriate comments, stating the parents must have been sincere to sacrifice their children, but the Bible clearly tells us their actions were condemned by God.] It is very plain that sincerity must be coupled with knowledge of God’s will for us to please God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The value of sincerely taking in accurate knowledge is set forth at John 17:3, where Jesus said, . . . [Read and comment.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Today more than ever before there is need to get this all-important knowledge that leads to life. To this end I am pleased to offer you a year’s subscription for this Bible-study aid, ‘The Watchtower,’ together with these three Bible-study booklets, on a contribution of $1. ‘The Watchtower’ is the most widely read religious magazine in all the world. People of all religions sincerely interested in gaining accurate knowledge of God’s purposes learn and benefit from this outstanding Bible journal. In this issue . . . [Tie in an article and make offer.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (5 min.) Demonstrate use of sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Observe ease of giving sermon. Encourages all publishers to practice sermon so as to be well equipped to use it, sharing in the “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Visit of Circuit Servant </span><span class="font12">(Conf’d) he and his wife will be able to work with twelve publishers each. Undoubtedly this provision for the circuit servant and his wife to help more publishers and pioneers in magazine service will have a good effect on magazine placements, which have been dropping. Saturday evening activities will remain the same and so will what is scheduled for Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Meetings for field service throughout the week, morning and afternoon, will be held at suitable </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ARE YOU ANSWERING THE CALL TO PIONEER?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">This supplement should be kept because each of the five parts will be considered separately on the service meeting during the months of December 1963 through April 1964. It will be conducted by an enthusiastic brother, one qualified to handle this material. It will be conducted like a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">study, with each paragraph being read after considering the questions on the paragraph. Study the material and come prepared for a lively, informative discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During the 1963 service year there were, on an average, 280,052 publishers preaching the Kingdom message every month in the United States. This was 12,616 more ministers in the field every month than during the previous year. Truly, as Jesus said, “the harvest is great.” As great as it is—and it is marvelous in our eyes—there Is a vast multitude not being reached regularly with the message. In the United States there are still some counties that were last worked before 1958, and 782 counties still not assigned to congregations. Some congregations covei<sup>-</sup> their territory once a year or less and many other congregations have territory that needs more regular coverage. In addition to this, many congregations need mature servant leadership. Are you seriously considering answering the appeal, “Step over into Macedonia and help us”?—Matt. 9:37; Acts 16:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In view of these needs the Society has regularly sent out a call for more pioneers. As you consider the above facts you will see that they point to the great work that needs to be done before Armageddon strikes in execution of divine judgment. Many more persons are to be reached with the message so they may take flight to safety. Does your desire to reach these people move you to respond to the call to pioneer? In Jesus’ day a similar situation existed. “On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” To be sure, there are many persons in the world, the field, that are “skinned and thrown about” and need shepherds to guide them. We too feel tender affection for them and see the need for more full-time “workers,” more pioneers.—Matt. 9: 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The call Is so urgent that Jesus said: “Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:38) The Master is thus implored to stimulate the desire in the hearts of many to respond to the plea and become “workers” in the harvest. By the term “workers” is meant persons who would be so concerned that they would be anxious to pitch in to get the harvest work done before unfavorable weather sets in. Each day that goes by, the time left to accomplish this work is reduced. Energetic persons with a vision of the need are required to be at work “urgently,” as Paul admonished at 2 Timothy 4: 2. The tremendous task at hand demands willing workers I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Individually, then, we have a responsibility to examine ourselves. Are you holding back from the pioneer service when you could serve in this capacity? Have you personally analyzed your circumstances? If you are in position to pioneer, what is preventing you from answering the call? It may be necessary for you to put up a hard fight for the faith in order to overcome the materialistic philosophy of life peculiar to this generation, which philosophy prevents some from being spiritually-minded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Unquestionably, there are many in the New World society who can and should give more serious consideration to the call to pioneer. To these we say: Do not delay! Take positive action toward answering the call for more pioneers. Do not take the negative approach and say, ‘One does not have to pioneer to get into God’s new order.’ Actually, each person is judged on the basis of what he can do, and Jehovah expects one to increase or give more attention to the Kingdom interests to the extent that he can. (For further information on this please see the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> supplement for December, 1962.) So why rationalize and miss out on the joys, privileges and responsibilities that can be yours if you are in position to pioneer? We urge you to give this matter thorough consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Those of you who cannot become regular pioneers, make wise use of your time and energies. Jehovah is aware of what you are able to do. Perhaps you cannot respond to the call to become a regular pioneer now, but you can enjoy the vacation pioneer service. Whatever your circumstances, keep in mind the Importance and urgency of preaching. The dedicated Christian will endeavor to share fully in the harvesting work. The call is urgent. Will you be one of these willing workers who can and will increase his privileges of service by responding to the Master’s call? Happy are those who respond to the call to pioneer. —Ezek. 3:17; 1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDY QUESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What increase has there been during the last year, but what other facts show there is still much work to be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. In view of the needs, what attitude and desire should we have?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. What kind of workers are needed? 4. What questions should each one ask himself?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5. What negative view should be dispelled, and why?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">6. If one cannot be a regular pioneer now, what could he do?</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PARENTS, ARE YOU ANSWERING THE CALL TO PIONEER?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In the United States there are some 125,000 publishers under sixteen years of age. It is most gratifying to see this large number of young ministers, many of whom regularly share in the ministry ten hours or more each month. It is also most gratifying to see many of these vacation pioneering during school vacations and entering the regular pioneer service upon graduating. Parents are to be commended for giving their children such guidance in their early years. This has resulted in aiding children to grow to greater maturity and to shoulder responsibilities in the New World society. We encourage all you parents to keep up the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Parents should be very proud to see their children serve in the pioneer ministry. Wise parents will hold this goal before their children during their formative years. Directing the thinking and youthful aspirations of children toward pioneering helps them to grow up with this in mind. To them pioneering will be the natural thing to do in later years. How can you parents best do this? By inculcating the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">desire for</span><span class="font12"> a career as a pioneer in the hearts and minds of your children at every opportunity. Could there be a greater trust that you could give to your children? Could they have a finer career this side of Armageddon? Obviously not. Much can be done along this line by scheduling family Bible studies, field service and meeting attendance together and by helping your children to serve as vacation pioneers during the year. Some parents are now serving as regular pioneers, while not neglecting family responsibilities, and in this way they are setting the finest possible example. Many other parents very commendably serve as vacation pioneers as often as possible. At other times these parents display a fine example by doing well as publishers, spend-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ing ten or more hours each month in the field service. This is a fine way to cultivate the pioneer spirit in your children.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Parents are reminded that the responsibility to prepare their children for the future rests upon them. Parents are to “train up a boy according to the way for him.” Youth must be prepared for the future, and parents must cultivate in them the mature view of what constitutes spiritual security. Keep in mind that your children are no exception to the divine statement that “the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.” Because this is true you should exert your influence and at times your parental authority and discipline to direct the minds of your children so they will &quot;keep Jehovah’s way” before them. Be diligent so your children do not grow up to be unaware of “Jehovah’s way,” indifferent, irresponsible spiritual delinquents. —Prov. 22:6; Gen. 8:21; 18:19; Deut. 6: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is right for you parents to prepare your children for adult life and marriage. However, this preparation should include giving emphasis to spiritual matters and helping them to find their place in the New World society. This is best done by parents’ instilling in their hearts the desire for a career as a pioneer. It would be very wise for parents to encourage their children to devote at least a few years to the pioneer service upon completion of high school. They could have no finer training. Shouldering the responsibilities of the pioneer service will help them to grow to maturity and prepare them to handle additional responsibilities of life, including, if they desire, marriage at an appropriate time. If they choose to marry, they will, as a result of having had proper spiritual education and values of life taught them, never regret the time spent in pioneer service and will benefit by the contribution it has made toward their happiness, contentment and maturity. Many will even continue to pioneer with their marriage mates, devoting all their efforts to the advancement of Kingdom interests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In view of the urgent call for more pioneers, it is important for parents to reflect now on the way they are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">directing</span><span class="font12"> their children. Are your children going the way they </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font12"> go or the way they </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font12"> to go? Are they being properly directed, or being misdirected? Speaking of direction, it is a fine thing to require your children to make good use of the public educational facilities by going through high school and thus cultivate certain abilities for future use—if possible, learning a trade during these school years. On the other hand, is it not a matter of misdirection for parents to encourage children to attend the colleges and universities of the day where materialistic philosophies and ideologies are taught and disbelief in God and his Word is fostered? (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">issues of February 15, 1952, pages 117-120 and May 15, 1956, pages 313-315.) To prepare your children reasonably for worldly vocations and so-called “security” is proper, but to neglect the spiritual aspect in life is to misdirect them. To provide them with many material things and a bank account but to neglect their spiritual education is to endanger their welfare and is not following the “authoritative advice of Jehovah.” The authoritative advice from Jehovah through his organization is to respond favorably to the call for more pioneers.—Eph. 6: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Remember, parents, the best instruction you can give is by your own example. How are you responding to the call to pioneer? In many cases you can answer it yourselves by serving as regular or vacation pioneers. If you do not find this possible, then diligently serve as congregation publishers, shouldering your responsibilities and being a good example to your children. You can also answer the call to pioneer by cultivating the pioneer spirit in your children. Your doing so will bring Jehovah’s blessings.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>YOUTHS, ARE YOU ANSWERING THE CALL TO PIONEER?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> From his birth Samuel’s parents resolved to fill his life with the service of Jehovah. At his weaning his mother took him to the house of Jehovah to serve there “all the days that he does happen to be . . . and Samuel was ministering before Jehovah, as a boy.” Samuel followed the direction of his parents. The account tells us that “all the while Samuel was growing bigger and more likable both from Jehovah’s standpoint and from that of men.” “And Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah himself proved to be with him.” How helpful was the wise direction of his parents and how commendable was his obedience to them and Jehovah I Younger publishers, in relation to the ministry, how would you say you are viewed “from Jehovah’s standpoint and from that of men”?—1 Sam. 1:28; 2:18, 26; 3 :19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now, none of you are special cases like Samuel, but who is there to say that the call to pioneer from Jehovah’s organization today is less important than Jehovah’s call to Samuel? Jehovah’s organization sees the importance of our times and the need for persons to lend themselves to the work at hand. How are you responding to this call? Although you are “growing bigger” and are looked upon by men as a fine young boy or girl, what about your spiritual progress? Samuel’s likableness was mainly because of his service to Jehovah. It is good that you look to the future with respect to your personal life and plan accordingly, but have you included Jehovah and the ministry? To you the words at Ecclesiastes 12:1 are addressed: “Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come.” Yes, now is the time to give serious consideration to the call to pioneer while you have your youth and vigor. If you really want to share in the most worthwhile work on earth today, do in-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font12">elude pioneering in your plans for the future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you are serious-minded and industrious with regard to other matters, if you are a willing worker, one who shoulders responsibility at home, assisting your mother and father, you are likely one who seriously considers his obligation to Jehovah, and your plans for the future no doubt include the pioneer ministry. On the other hand, if you are lazy and indifferent with respect to such matters, your attitude may be reflected in how you view the pioneer service. It is most gratifying to see that many have demonstrated their industriousness not only by shouldering responsibilities in the home and being regular 10-hour-a-month publishers during the school term, but also by engaging in the vacation pioneer work regularly during school vacations. This has proved to be invaluable experience to them as they later reach</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> To prevent you from making this fine spiritual progress, Satan has devised many means and timeconsuming pursuits to distract you. Many have become victims of his sly methods and have given in to fleshly cravings for worldly pleasures and materialism. Others have allowed sports, worldly association, cars and entertainment of all kinds to become a snare. It is just as foretold, many have become “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” Today, materialism is made very attractive. There are many high-paying jobs available, jobs that offer opportunity for worldly advancement. The pursuit of these lucrative jobs on finishing school and the desire for more than the necessary things have proved to be a snare to many. It has obstructed their vision and is preventing them from responding to the call to pioneer. Guard against these worldly pursuits and the timeconsuming extracurricular activities in school by maintaining your</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>AS A FAMILY ARE</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As a family unit have you discussed pioneering? An aid to realizing the goal of one or more members of the family serving as pioneers is that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font12"> family have, the pioneer spirit at heart. As a family member you should recognize your responsibility to give serious consideration to the call for more pioneers, even though you may not be in position at this time to serve as a pioneer yourself. How? If you cannot serve as a pioneer because of valid .Scriptural reasons now, you may be in position to assist other members of your family financially or otherwise so they may serve. This should bring you a great deal of satisfaction, for, in addition to the service you are personally able to render, you have helped to answer the call by manifesting the pioneer spirit at heart with deeds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In order to have such an outlook it is necessary that you appreciate the importance of pioneering and the part this is playing in Jehovah’s purposes. Be convinced of the many fine benefits to the family by having one or more members serve as pioneers. If all the members of the family work </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font12"> to this end, there will be many wholesome benefits morally and spiritually derived by the family. When spiritual matters are given preference by the family circle, rather than material things, Jehovah’s spirit and blessing are abundant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When all in the family cooperate, pioneering by one or more memspirituality and balance in all things.—2 Tim. 3: 4; 1 Pet. 1:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Do you have a desire to marry or are you already married? Do your plans with your mate or prospective mate include the pioneer ministry? One young brother who recently married and also enrolled as a regular pioneer with his newlywed wife says, “I would definitely like to recommend this as the most rewarding work for newlyweds. Marriage is certainly not something that should keep one out of the pioneer ranks. Marriage very wonderfully provides one with a permanent pioneer partner.” Still others have ‘made room’ for the single state and are devoting a lifetime to the rewarding and soul-satisfying service as pioneers. Many are now serving happily at Bethel homes. How about you? TFTiat </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">are you do-ina with your time?</span><span class="font12">—Matt. 19:12; 1 Cor. 7 : 29.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">bers of the family is conducive to the spiritual prosperity of all. It has a good influence upon the children and helps them build to the future. More opportunities are available for parents and children to share in the ministry together. If a proper schedule is followed, there need be no neglect of the children and domestic responsibilities. To the contrary, the children are surrounded with a wholesome atmosphere and exposed to good training. Such training will contribute to their spirituality and prove most valuable to the children and rewarding to the parents now and later. Pioneering by a family member also contributes to the happiness of the family circle as each one looks out for the other’s welfare. Spiritually strong and happy families bring collective benefits to the congregation and, in reality, strong families make strong congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What about financial matters? One sistei’ doing some secular work writes: “Many times I have vacation pioneered. Wanting to be a regular pioneer, I talked it over with my husband and son and our agreement was that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font12"> could cut down on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font12"> expenses.” Can you as a family, or personally, reduce various interests and expenses to make this possible? Perhaps you will not get the latest model car, TV set, and so forth, but where is your heart? Since “life does not result from the become ‘more likable from Jehovah’s standpoint.’ Heed the advice from Jehovah’s organization and from those that have the pioneer spirit at heart, and become a pioneer now. If you are still going to school, be a ten-hour publisher each month. Serve as a vacation pioneer every year during school vacations and plan on entering the regular pioneer service when you graduate. Your doing so now will prove to be a blessing to you later.—Eph. 5:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> for May 1963, page one, encouraged all families to get together and study the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom. Ministry</span><span class="font12"> supplement for December 1962. Have you done so? If not, we suggest that you do so now. See what can be done to work out a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">family schedule</span><span class="font12"> so that at least one member of your family is on the pioneer list. With each member of the family, including the children, sharing in the household duties, much can be done to achieve this goal. Many who have finished school will no doubt be able to be regular pioneers now. Since many are now pioneers in spite of family opposition, it is indeed important that families where all are in the truth give the call to pioneer serious and prayerful consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Fathers, take the advice of this regular pioneer and family man who wrote, “I really began to see the need for pioneering; so I counted the cost and, after analyzing matters, I found out that I really did not have any Scriptural reasons for not pioneering.” Mothers, notice what this regular pioneer and mother of three says: “Upon reading the articles on pioneering, I could see that I could pioneer and still have time to do things for myself around the home and care for my children.” Young ministers, have you served as vacation pioneers? Can you now serve as regular pioneers? If you are about to finish school or have just graduated, what are your plans? Discuss the matter with your family or others with the pioneer spirit at heart. Observe the assistance and encouragement received by this young man: “Upon graduation from high school I received a scholarship to a university. I planned to attend college.” After talking to those with the pioneer spirit at heart (there are some who do not have such) he states, “I changed my mind about what course to pursue.” He is now a happy regular pioneer I</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Make pioneering a family matter and something to pray about together.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> ‘Should I become a pioneer?’ you may ask. ‘Will I be able to make my time? How will I meet my expenses? Will I be able to take care of my family responsibilities? Will my health and age stand such a schedule?’ Who can better answer these and other questions and dispel these fears than those who have pioneered for many years—so why not ask them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The quotations that follow are from three pioneers now on the list. Their age and then their years of continuous pioneer service follow each quotation. These are their thoughts to you: “There is nothing to compare with what Jehovah and Christ Jesus have for those who put their trust in them and who put them foremost in their lives. There is nothing that can take the place of having preached the Kingdom message so many years.” (90, 37) “My whole desire was to do all I could in Jehovah’s service and I saw that it was the pioneer ministry that was the best way for me to grow to maturity. I was poor as far as finances were concerned, but I put my trust in Jehovah even though I had nothing. He would open the way for me, which he did. There is no higher or more important work on earth.” (85, 32) “Before I started to pioneer I was offered a job with a fair income and all expenses paid. That meant financial security with a savings account for my old age. I had to make a decision. Could I trust Jehovah to provide for my pioneer years and also my old age if I threw away this opportunity? I trusted Jehovah. He has not failed me.” (75, 19)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> In addition to the above direct quotations from three happy aged pioneers who have served for many years and who are still serving joyfully, read the good report from a circuit servant regarding another: “This sister is a marvel. She often uses the telephone and her voice is so weak she can hardly talk. I sat in on one of her Bible studies and learned a point or two. She is an inspiration.” She is ninety-one and has served for forty years.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Concerning a pioneer now seventy-eight years old and serving forty-two years we received this good report: “He shows a wonderful spirit and is devoted.” A good example is seen in the report of another pioneer, eighty-three years old and who has served thirty-four years: “He is a very good example for others and quite active for his age. He is completely devoted to Jehovah, and his ministry is still productive.” And of a pioneer now eighty years old and who has served for thirty-two years we are told, “He is a fine example of faithfulness, aids new ones to the organization regularly and encourages others.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Look at the good report on these two couples. Of the first couple we note that he is seventy-four and she seventy-three years old, with both serving for thirty-five years as pioneers. “He is alert and mature and his heart is still in pioneering. She is enthusiastic and a great help to the publishers.” Of the second couple we are told, “Their faithful service over a period of years is very exemplary. He sets a fine example of endurance and patience. She continues to serve faithfully.” Both of them have served as pioneers for thirty-two years!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Are not these good reports an inspiration? Yes, like this one in which we are told she is a “walking example of steadfastness and a marvel for her age. Her whole manner and disposition is indicative of the very important business she must attend to as a pioneer,” even though she is seventy-three years old and has served for twenty-three years. Do you feel you have problems and cannot pioneer? Be encouraged by the good report on this pioneer: “She is blind but is an amazingly cheerful sister, testifying to the power of Jehovah’s spirit.” What a manifestation of love! Although blind and seventy-six years old, she has served as a pioneer for the last fifteen years!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What more can we say? Time and space are insufficient to relate the reports of many other aged pioneers now serving faithfully. The report from our older brothers is indeed encouraging. However, let us not forget the thousands of younger ones who have likewise spent many years in the pioneer service and are still doing so. These have given up scholarships, lucrative jobs and many other interests. To all of you we say, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Keep up the good report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Take another look at the good report. Does it not indicate the happy and soul-satisfying benefits of the pioneer ministry? Having considered the report, do you feel you can pioneer and help make the report better? We hope so. Why not talk to pioneers in your circuit, young or old, or to your circuit or district servant or their wives who have served for many years and who are living testimonies of the benefits and blessings of the pioneer service? Talk to the congregation servant, committee or other servants. They will be pleased to aid you. Then taste of it yourself as a vacation pioneer. You may be ready now to apply for the regular pioneer work. Your enrolling as a pioneer now will bring you much joy, and your service will bring great praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> A few adjustments in the theocratic ministry school schedule for 1964 are planned to give us all a more active part. Each week all of us will be assigned a portion of the Bible to read. We will do this at home. In due time we will read the entire Bible. Our home reading assignments are scheduled in the same Bible book that will be discussed that week in the school. We will concentrate more direct attention on the Bible itself through the use of our thrilling new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Ml Scripture Is Inspired, of God, and, Beneficial” (si).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Each school session will be a symposium of five talks or demonstrations, all of them usually being based on the same Bible book. The first is the instruction talk. It will cover material designed to give us better background knowledge of the Bible book itself. The speaker should select a subject theme around which to develop his talk. He should amplify the material as necessary, doing any required research in the Bible and the Society’s publications. He should concentrate particularly on material not assigned to students or, at the most, treat such portions in a more general way, leaving details to the student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The first of the four student talks, or talk number’ two, will generally be simply a narration of some outstanding portion of the Bible book. The objective is to give the Bible account, not to explain its meaning or apply the principles embodied in it. This talk will replace the reading assignment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The other student talks, numbers 3 to 5, will usually be more than mere summations of the assigned material. They will be explanatory or interpretive talks, making application of the scriptures to show how and why they are beneficial. Not all the portion assigned need be read or discussed. Whenever possible we will use those key texts that bear most directly on the subject theme assigned. The rest of the scripture assignment is given primarily for background so that the scriptures discussed will not be taken out of context. Neither should the talk be simply a discussion of different isolated texts from the assignment. We should get the central theme in mind and tie all parts of the talk together. In some cases the verses covered by two student talks will be the same, but, as indicated by the assigned themes, the talks will be given from completely different viewpoints.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In especially the last three student talks we want to have in mind the particularly beneficial nature of the material assigned. Try to develop settings that will highlight the profitable use of these texts in everyday activity. This will be of more value to the rest of the school, since it will demonstrate application of the texts and how they can be used in a practical way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The written review is scheduled to follow a completed study of a portion of the Bible rather than at regular intervals as heretofore. To prepare, complete your assigned home Bible reading and review the questions in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </span><span class="font12">Material from both will be covered by the questions but only the Bible may be used while you are taking the review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The new schedule should allow the school servant a minute or so to introduce the session effectively and perhaps another minute or so to conclude with a brief sum-up or to whet the appetites of all for the following week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> We will want to encourage all interested persons to join with us in this inspiring consideration of God’s Word. Since our home Bible reading assignment is a vital new provision of the school, let us diligently keep up with our assignments, reading our Bible daily, rejoicing in the blessings we will receive.</span></p></li></ul>

Instead, we will take the initiative and then allow God’s spirit to operate upon them. Preparation, of course, is necessary on their part, and so we will rehearse a magazine presentation or the simplified sermon with them, even writing the words out for them if this appears necessary to build up their confidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In the service we will want to be sure that they have a share either by making the presentation themselves, if qualified, or allowing them to assist in our presentation. When they only listen, progress will be slower and interest may lag. If our presentation has been simple and we have avoided long discussions, they will be built up and encouraged by the experience. Should they be counseled? Commendation at this point will serve a far better purpose, though some counsel, offered in a kind, tactful way, may be appropriate.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Field service will be a new thing in their daily routine so it will be good to allow time for them to make this adjustment in their lives. Usually it is best to keep them out in the field for shorter periods of time initially, gradually lengthening this, lovingly taking into account their physical strength and other factors. Some have become tired and discouraged by two or three hours in the field when still new. Others have stopped altogether, feeling that too much is required.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If the one conducting the study cannot take the new one out each week as scheduled, undoubtedly the help of another mature publisher can be enlisted to aid in order that the training can continue without interruption. Of course, it is important to get these two quite well acquainted first, as new ones usually prefer to work with the one who conducted the study with them and who knows the extent of their knowledge, and so might hesitate to work with someone not conducting the study. Hence, in many cases, more effective help can </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many fine reports have been received regarding the results obtained in using simplified sermons. One short presentation for the Bible offer is: “Good morning. My name is ------. The purpose of my visit</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">is to encourage Bible reading. Notice how Jesus stressed the importance of Bible knowledge when he said, as recorded at John 17:3 . . . [Read.] The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font12">is in modern English, which makes Bible reading more enjoyable and understandable. It is yours, along with this printed sermon, on a contribution of $1.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> If you find that many say, ‘I already have a Bible and don’t need another,’ you may find it advantageous to conclude the regular or simplified sermon by using examples from “Renderings of Scriptures Compared.” If the person has a King James Version Bible you could</span></p></li></ul>

For the convenience of these vacation and regular pioneers and other publishers, the congregation will arrange midweek service. These brothers can do much to help us reach the 10-percent increase, since many publishers and pioneers engaging in midweek service will be able to help some who are unable to go out on weekends.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Those who have become inactive and those with whom we are conducting studies and who are sufficiently advanced need our help early in the month. We can aid these persons with the simplified sermon or show them how to present magazines. Let us not forget to commend those who go out, encouraging them to continue. By helping these persons early in the month and, later, all publishers who have not reported by the 15th, we will be doing our part in working toward December’s goal.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA “Have faith to the preserving alive of the sou!.”—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Enjoy Peace Through Knowledge Daily Added To</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Ilse &quot;Babylon” or &quot;Paradise” Book</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> How happy the lot of those having peace with God and peace with their fellow Christians! Such abundant peace comes only to those who take in the right kind of knowledge regularly, daily being taught by Jehovah by means of his Word and organization, as it is written: “All your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.” (Isa. 54:13) We can aid others to take in knowledge that leads to such desirable peace by offering this month the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </span><span class="font9">All of us can use either a regular sermon or a simplified sermon to share in this offer. Be well prepared, and arrange a schedule that will enable you to be in the field ministry each week, offering either one of these books.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Having had an opportunity now to peruse the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book, we know what a great aid it is in gaining the right knowledge; so since we are eager to place it with people to help them get free from “Babylon the Great,” those congregations having a supply may use it during November. Congregations that do not have a supply will go right ahead with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book. Since all congregations will soon have a supply of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book, we will want to keep this in mind: Regularly in the months to come, whether we are offering the Bible or a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription, if the householder tells us that he has what we are offering, then we should be sure to offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book; always carry one with you in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you are going to offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book this month, you may either make up a sermon of your own or use this one showing that God’s kingdom rules in the midst of its enemies: Read Psalm 110:1, 2, showing how the King would rule in the midst of his enemies; then Revelation 12:7-9, showing how the Kingdom takes power and ousts Satan from heaven; and Revelation 14:6-8, emphasizing that the operation of the Kingdom is “everlasting good news” and that it is good news to know that “Babylon the Great” has fallen. (For more scriptures see Sermon 31C in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines.) </span><span class="font9">Then show the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font9"> book, explaining how it clarifies the mystery of “Babylon the Great.” Mention its explanation of Revelation, chapters 14 through 22. For a simplified sermon we may use Revelation 14 ;6-8, telling the householder you are</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> ‘As a result of working with pioneers, I have been able to increase my ministerial efficiency and the amount of time spent in field service and have enjoyed much greater blessings.’ Not at all unusual is it for the Society to receive such expressions from publishers who have taken advantage of op-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God's Kingdom Rules!” or “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,” and a booklet, for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At Peace Through Knowledge Daily Added To.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">portunities to work with pioneers. Appreciating the many benefits that result from publishers working with pioneers, the Society has encouraged servants and pioneers to work together in making arrangements so more publishers will have the opportunity of working with pioneers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Also, think of other benefits this would bring to the congrecertain they would enjoy hearing “everlasting good news.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> While being anxious to place a book, we certainly will not forget that the ideal way to help others have the promised peace is through Bible studies. Start Bible studies when the literature is placed. If a study cannot be started on the initial call, make definite arrangements for a return call to demonstrate how to use the book, or the booklet, and the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> To help us reach our Bible study goal, Bible study servants will want to talk to publishers and pioneers who are not conducting studies and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1) </span><span class="font9">gation. For example, many pioneers work alone day after day. They would be pleased to have you accompany them in the territory, for this is mutually upbuilding and encouraging. On the other hand, often publishers would be glad to engage in service—if they had someone to go with. Servants will therefore want to work out good, practical, midweek field service arrangements so publishers and pioneers can work together. Some publishers will find they will be able to vacation pioneer as the result of such an arrangement, and any who can are encouraged to do so. Servants will also encourage pioneers to aid and build up new and irregular publishers to share in midweek service. This will help more to reach the ten-hour goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In addition to spending more time in field service, publishers who desire assistance in the sermon work, back-call activity or in starting a Bible study, or who wish suggestions for increasing magazine placements, are encouraged to work </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Show importance of following up all “Paradise” or other book placements by (1) starting studies on initial call or (2) starting study on return call, using book and demonstrating its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (4 min.) On initial call, publisher concludes sermon with Psalm 37:10, 11, places book and says to householder: Tf you have a few minutes I would like to step in to demonstrate how the book may be used to gain further information on God’s purpose for man.’ When inside, continue, ‘The questions at the bottom of each page will help you pick out the main points in each paragraph. Note on page 9, paragraph 1 [turn to page 9], the question is asked, “W’hat is a paradise?” May I have your thought?’ (Paragraph is discussed.) Chairman breaks in and explains, ‘After several paragraphs are discussed, definite arrangements are made to return.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Often on a back-call a study can be started without a back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (4 min.) After introducing himself, publisher says: ‘Last week I left the “Paradise” book with you and we discussed Psalm 37: 10, 11. It shows there will be an end to wickedness and that meek persons will inherit the earth. May I step in for just a few moments and show you how the book can be used to learn the Bible’s teaching on paradise and its restoration? If you’ll bring your copy and the Bible I’ll show you how it makes clear the Bible teaching on paradise.’ Then (as in above demonstration) publisher proceeds to demonstrate use of book. Cover paragraph 1 more quickly and discuss paragraph 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (8 min.) Discuss with audience the principles involved in starting study on back-call: Keep good record of placement, make definite appointment and then keep it; be well prepared; get into book as demonstrated as soon as possible. Ask for a few experiences from publishers and pioneers who have used these methods.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8">If Christians are going to help themselves and others in the way of life, they will have to exercise patience. (Jas. 5:7, 8) Our brothers are exercising this quality. After eight years an “Awake!” subscriber, a man and his family, began to study and attend meetings, and soon five of them became Witnesses. (120 Hl) By exercising patience, fear and prejudice are overcome (174 1J4&gt;, studies are started and new worshipers praise Jehovah. (198 Hl; 208 Hl) Many years of persevering produced a harvest of twelve zealous publishers within one family. (163 fl2) Studies are productive when there is patience along with careful planning.

<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Display sermon for all to see. Discuss sermon with audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: The Bible’s Promise of a Better System of Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bright promise of better conditions —Rev. 21:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God, through Kingdom, brings end to present wicked conditions, restoring peace and health —Dan. 2:44 Taking in knowledge and acting upon it can assure life in Bible-promised new system of things —John 17:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suggested introduction and transitions: “In these days when sickness, death and disunity among people are the major items of news, I would like to brighten your day by showing you briefly the Bible’s promise of better conditions to come on earth. Certainly you would enjoy receiving good news for a change, isn’t that true? Revelation 21:3, 4 gives this good news [read]. You may wonder, though, how this can come about in view of the seemingly permanent gloomy conditions on earth. It could only be through the power of God and his kingdom to destroy the powers that bring evil conditions on earth. Daniel 2:44 tells how [read]. The Bible shows we need to have the right knowledge to understand what is coming on the earth and how we may gain everlasting life under perfect conditions. We are advised by Jesus . . . [read John 17:3]. For the purpose of helping you take in knowledge of God and his promises we are encouraging the reading of the Bible in modern English. You may have this copy of the ‘New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures’ for only $1. With the Bible we are giving a copy of ‘This Good News of the Kingdom,’ which is an aid to studying the Bible.” After placing Bible, demonstrate study of booklet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Never Failing Our God in This Time of the End.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower,” December 15, 1962, pp. 744-758, also issue of December 1, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Publishers, Work with Pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22 min: Aid All to Share During December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) All are encouraged when we see increase. In December we will work for a 10-percent increase, which is 308,057 publishers. To reach it, new ones must be helped into the service and those who are irregular or inactive assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (3 min.) Bible study servant asks book study conductor what prospects are for increase in his service center. Conductor not sure. Servant shows him list of studies conducted by publishers in the service center for a year or more. They discuss prospects together. When asked what to do, servant replies: “This is the way I handled it in my service center last week.” Conductor watches from side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (13 min.) Bible study servant approaches sister about study she has conducted for some time. Will they share in service? She has been preparing them and feels sure they will start in service. Servant commends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Servant approaches another sister. She believes person she studies with is ready for service, but is not sure how to approach the matter. Servant suggests, first week, after conclusion of study, discuss one or two Scriptural commands such as Matthew 5:15, 16 and 1 Corinthians 9:16, 17. Second week discuss appropriate local experiences, experiences from “Yearbook” or own personal experiences encouraging service. Third week consider a magazine presentation or simplified sermon and invite householder to share in work. Publisher encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Servant calls on irregular publisher. After friendly exchange of greetings, expresses concern over publisher’s not sharing regularly in service. They discuss 1 Corinthians 9:16, 17. Publisher realizes responsibility too. Wants to do right thing but feels inadequate. Servant shows ease of using simplified sermon. Publisher feels he can handle it. Agrees to practice it. They make appointment to work together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (2 min.) Conductor thanks servant for practical suggestions. Will do same at his service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Encourages all publishers to follow suggestions given in scene two. Bible study servant will give study conductors a list of studies conducted for some time by publishers with their service centers so each can approach publishers. Conductors and other mature publishers will help irregular ones beginning the first week of December.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION ORGANIZATION</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Congregation Book Study How to Conduct the Study (Part 2)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The question is often asked, “How many pages should we cover in an evening?” The principle to keep in mind is that enough material should be covered to keep the study lively and informative and yet at the same time not move too fast, making it difficult to comprehend. The conductor should be in control of the situation at all times. Never should the study be allowed to deteriorate into a debate over some inconsequential point; nor should the conductor digress greatly from the material to be covered for that evening. This calls for good preparation on the part of the conductor and the publishers attending too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Alert study conductors will want to highlight useful field points too. For example, if certain points would be particularly helpful in your ministry, the conductor can point this out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Should the conductor at the congregation book study call on persons by their first names only? No, that would not be fitting. Use first and last names. If some are referred to as “brother” or “sister,” then use of the. first name may be unnecessary. For a complete discussion of this matter, please refer to the September 15,1951, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font9">pages 574, 575. Also, we do not call newcomers “brother” or “sister,” but that does not necessarily mean that we would not do so later on as such persons approach baptism. Ananias</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font8"> and calendars may be ordered after November 25. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks </span><span class="font8">are 50c each and calendars 25c each. The calendars will be available in ten languages, as follows: English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish. Please order through your congregation. Pioneers on the list before July 1,1963, may receive a free </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> by placing a request with the literature servant, who will include it with the congregation order and later request credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A copy of the 1964 Theocratic Ministry School Schedule should be given to each publisher as soon as the congregation supply is received.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">•0-All who can vacation pioneer during December, either for two weeks or the entire month, are invited to submit applications now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Make December 25 a special magazine day. Order additional magazines by the end of November so all will have sufficient magazines to use in their ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">^Literature offer: December, New </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</span><span class="font8"> with a 32-page booklet, for $1. January through April, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">subscription, with three booklets, for $1. </span><span class="font9">called Saul “brother” just before baptizing him. (Acts 9:17) As to when we call those who attend meetings “brother” or “sister,” good judgment must be used. It depends to a large extent on the attitude of the interested person toward the organization and the work we do. If a person is attending regularly and apparently is approaching baptism, then it would seem proper to call that one “brother” or “sister.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Finally, we come to the closed-book review at the end of the study. Everyone should have his book closed for this spirited question-and-answer session of two or three minutes. The conductor should prepare pointed questions in advance, and these should be designed to stress the theme of the lesson as well as underscore the important points highlighted that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Following the closed-book review come the announcements. Generally these include such service announcements as are appropriate to that group, enabling them to know how, when and where they can share in the field service that week. Perhaps the conductor will read the service meeting program for that week, too, or he may comment on an outstanding part of it, for this enables the group to prepare intelligently for this meeting and to bring any equipment that may be required. It may also be good for the conductor to encourage the brothers to prepare for the next week's study, perhaps suggesting the number of pages to study. Then the study will be closed with prayer.</span></p>

In addition to the 192-page report itself, which is replete with pictures, an additional 32 pages of fine pictures on glossy paper are included, enabling you to see what happened at the various assemblies as well as the places visited and the sights seen by those who made the world tour. It is something you will read with great benefit, and you will want to place copies with persons of goodwill. It may be had for 35c. There will be no pioneer rate. The Report will be ready for mailing on November 25. Congregations may include their order for a supply with any regular literature order to be filled after that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoulder Your Responsibility —As a Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Are you one of those privileged to be an overseer, an appointed assistant servant or study conductor in the ever-expanding New World society? Thank Jehovah for that privilege! What a blessing you can be to your brothers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What are some of the ways that you servants can best shoulder your responsibilities before Jehovah and your brothers? By being friendly and approachable so that the brothers will have confidence in you and will come to you with their problems. By being prompt and on time at all the meetings and by being available to greet the brothers and welcome the strangers. By showing love, patience and understanding when the brothers have problems and by giving them good, practical Scriptural counsel to overcome their problems. And when it comes to organizational matters, the overseer should visit and inspect the service centers periodically, building up the brothers in love, commending them where they have done well and offering encouraging counsel for improvement on ministerial weaknesses. If you are an assistant ministerial servant, do you care well for your organizational responsibilities? Do you cooperate fully with the overseer, giving him due respect and assistance, lightening his heavy load of responsibility? If you are a study conductor, do you take keen interest in the spiritual development of each publisher in your service center? This loving, personal attention identifies a fine shepherd.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> All the publishers look to you, as an appointed servant or study conductor, for a good example. “Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him.” (Luke 12:48) In this respect, are the members of your family individually reaching the ten-hour goal? Are they attending all the meetings and growing to spiritual maturity? Shouldering your responsibilities as a servant means first of all caring well for your family and then branching out to aid others within your service center or congregation, that they too may be helped to grow to spiritual maturity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Yes, thank Jehovah for your inestimable privileges, brothers. May Jehovah continue to go with you, and may each publisher cooperate fully with the appointed servants and study conductors in order that Jehovah’s favor may be upon you as you joyfully' shoulder your responsibilities.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Simplified Sermon to Place “Paradise” Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In presenting the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book newer publishers may find it advantageous to use a simplified sermon. Also, more experienced publishers will want to shorten their presentations when people say they do not have time. You will find that Psalm 37:10, 11 lends itself well to a number of presentations. For example, one might say: “Many times people are heard to say, We have always had wars and always will. However, the Bible shows that a change is to be made. Notice what is said at Psalm 37:10, 11 [read]. World conditions have steadily gone from bad to worse; yet on the basis of God’s promise we can expect a change for the better.” Turn to page 219 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book and call attention to the illustration, saying: “Instead of wars and sorrow, there will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Enjoy Peace &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">make arrangements for other publishers and pioneers who are good at starting studies to work with and help these share in this feature of the ministry. Let us see how many of the approximately 160,000 publishers who are not conducting Bible studies can be assisted to do so before the month ends.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> By more of us conducting studies, more will find it possible to reach the goal of ten hours in the ministry each month. Does your schedule call for at least ten hours? If you have difficulty working out a schedule, talk to your congregation servant or book study conductor. They will be pleased to help you work out a practical schedule. Also aiding us in reaching our goal is the matter of taking full advantage of worldly holidays to “buy out” opportunities for sharing peacegiving knowledge. This month worldly Thanksgiving Day is a fine opportunity for magazine work. Congregations will arrange morning and afternoon meetings for the field ministry for the convenience of the publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> December will soon be here, and that is the month we would all like to see a 10-percent increase. How are you doing toward reaching the goal as a congregation? For the peaceful conditions. Notice what is said in paragraph 32 [read].”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Another presentation could be: “Perhaps you have asked, Why doesn’t God do something about wicked conditions on earth? The world is in a bad state, isn’t it? [Let householder answer.] However, notice God’s promise at Psalm 37:10, 11 [read]. That God is going to destroy those who oppose him is clearly established in the Scriptures.” (Turn to pages 208 and 209 of book.) You could then comment: “The destruction of those who oppose God is depicted here, and notice the scriptures that explain how God will remove wicked conditions from earth.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Many persons you talk to may say, “I have that book.” Then say, “That is fine; then I am sure you would like to see this book.” Show the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </span><span class="font9">and make up your own sermon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">10-percent increase to be reached, new ones must be prepared for the field ministry. Now is the time for publishers conducting Bible studies to encourage and prepare these new ones for the ministry. It would be well for all conducting Bible studies with ones to be started in the service to cover the material in the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous Hew World.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Having in mind the desirable goals before us, let us grasp the opportunities and help others regularly to take in knowledge, that they may be taught by Jehovah and share with us in abundant peace.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Work with Pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">with pioneers who do well in these features of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Not only can pioneers aid and encourage publishers as outlined above, but publishers at times can aid pioneers. Pioneers who are low in back-calls, the number of Bible studies being conducted or in magazine placements obviously want to improve the weak feature of their ministry. Such pioneers are encouraged to approach mature publishers who can assist them; also, the Society has directed congregation servants to arrange for well-qualified publishers to work with pioneers who need assistance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN SEPTEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We started oft the new service year with 281,586 publishers active in the field ministry—an increase not only above the report for August but also above last year’s average of 280,052 publishers. Our average hours were 9.2 and our magazine placements 10.7. The publisher increase shows we are making progress. This has taken many hours of patient ministerial work, calling back on householders and conducting Bible studies. Not to be overlooked as a factor in the progress we have made is that family heads have studied with their children, training them in the ministry so that they can be active each week. Thus both adult and younger publishers are to be commended for the increase. Our 10-percent increase, which we are striving for in December, is 308,057 publishers. By our continuing in this faithful pattern of satisfying activity', by our aiding publishers who need encouragement and by our training new persons progressing to maturity to share the good news, this goal can be achieved, as Jehovah blesses our ministerial efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The result of publishers working with pioneers and of mature publishers assisting pioneers will not only be better pioneers and publishers, but added praise and future increases in the congregation. So publishers, cooperate.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Be </span><span class="font6">Courageous like the Lion Among Nations</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> With the nations opposed to God’s kingdom, it takes courage to preach the good news. But did Jesus Christ, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, hold back? Never I He preached with the courage of a lion. So likewise have the remnant of Christ’s followers since 1919; they have been like a lion among the nations. (Mic. 5:8) Now tens of thousands of “other<sup>-</sup> sheep” are associating with these courageous ones, and all of us are determined to show courage by sharing in Kingdom preaching despite opposition and obstacles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Now that we are in the third month of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign, the question arises: How are we doing? To be abreast of the suggested quotas, publishers should have at least one subscription, pioneers ten and special pioneers fifteen. Do not overlook house-to-house work with the sermon as the main source for new subscriptions. Make a notation of subscription promises and call back. Many have had good success in presenting </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> for $2. Have you tried this? Also, when a householder does not read English, keep in mind the many languages (shown on page two) in which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> is available. To obtain our quotas, w<sup>-</sup>e will need to be well prepared with the “Armageddon” sermon and to be in the field ministry </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each week.</span><span class="font10"> Last month suggestions were made regarding expiration slips. If all the calls have not been made yet, they should be completed this month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Be well organized for the ministry. Sunday morning<sup>-</sup> meetings for field ministry should be started promptly; hold them to no more than fifteen minutes, so the group can get right into the field. It is suggested that all publishers spend two hours in house-to-house work and an hour in the back-call or Bible study work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Though April is the month we hope for a 20-percent increase— which would be 320,923 publishers —we cannot wait till April to help our brothers and new ones. We see the need to put forth diligent efforts now. We can all cooperate by attending every service meeting this month, to be acquainted with what is to be done and how to do it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> What can those who are overseers do? Go through the Publisher’s Record cards to see what can be done to arouse some of the inactive and irregular ones during March. When at all possible, get them started in the ministry again. Each year there are some losses; in large congregations often persons may stop coming to meetings and we do not notice it for months. Do not he indifferent toward irregular publishers and those not attending meetings regularly. These brothers who</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription for “The Watchtower,” 5 with three booklets, for $1. J ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR MARCH |</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Courageous like the Lion Among (</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nations.—Mic. 5:8. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">are inactive have made a dedication to Jehovah. But what they have done so far means nothing if they do not courageously persevere. (Matt. 24:13) Sometimes they become discouraged because of indifference on the part of those to whom they preach, or they may get overwhelmed with work and personal problems. They need assistance. They may lose out if we do not help them now; love will prompt us to give that help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Beginning this month we will put forth special efforts to help the inactive and irregular publishers. To build up for the April campaign, let us put into practice the suggestions given in the demonstrations. Congregation servants may wish to assign each study conductor and mature publisher or pioneer some persons to help. Also, the overseer and study conductors may well use the back-call hour on Sunday to call on these persons who need help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Give special help also to young publishers, as well as the older ones, the sick and infirm. Show shut-ins how they can preach at home, how they can write letters and offer magazines to those who call at their home. Help older brothers who cannot walk well by assigning them suitable territory, or give them back-call slips or expiration slips, helping them with transportation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Then there are the new ones with whom we are studying. Carefully observe the demonstrations that will be presented to help these new ones take part in the preaching work. If appreciation is built up for preaching the good news and if the principles of the three-part demonstration are followed, many will want to start in the service during March and April. Use the special activity and magazines as a stimulus to help new ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Nor will we overlook discontinued studies. Call back on these persons this month, stimulating them with God’s Word, pointing out April’s special events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> One way we can work diligently to help new publishers and goodwill persons is to vacation pioneer in April. Can YOU vacation pioneer in April? Publishers who are in position to vacation pioneer are encouraged to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Many are the ways we can help our brothers and newly interested persons. And if we put forth diligent efforts during March and April, it is reasonable to expect we may reach April’s 20-percent increase. There is much to be done and many have problems to overcome; but with all of us being courageous like the lion among nations, we will make the Memorial month a milestone of praise to Jehovah and to his courageous King, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">SECOND MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: New World News, Announcements, Letters to the Society and 1963 Convention Travel Information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article, “Be Courageous like the Lion Among Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Spirited talk on “Let’s All Attend!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: “Presenting the Good News.” Demonstrate points on “Aiding Our Children in March.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include “What Happened Here in January?” and “1963 Calendar Special.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Question-and-answer discussion of pioneer information on “How to Become a Pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Preparing New Ones for Service in April (Part 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) To achieve the 20-percent increase in April will require planning and action now to prepare those with whom we study to share in the service. Put the suggestions into practice at your next study. (Note: Use same qualified, mature teacher as publisher in demonstration for all three weeks.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) Publisher after Bible study compliments student on fine progress he has made. Student expresses appreciation. Publisher states he is happy to be of help, for in this he is following the example of Jesus, who is our model. Luke 8:1 says of him . . . [read]. He taught his disciples to do the same work. (Acts 5:42) Their motive was love for God and for their fellowman. They recognized life was involved in preaching the good news and so do Jehovah’s witnesses today. (John 21: 15-17) In this way the command of Jesus is carried out. (Matt. 24:14) Every proper method is employed to get the good news preached. One of these is by public Bible talks. Invites student to attend one at Kingdom Hall on Sunday. Gives him some handbills he may pass along to his friends and neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Apply helpful suggestions at Bible studies during week, preparing new persons to share in service in April. Be at service meetings next two weeks to learn other steps to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">22 min: Demonstration: Aiding Each One to Share in Giving the Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Enthusiastically outlines possibilities for expansion. Strong should courageously assist the weak and show loving concern for their spirituality. (Rom. 15:1, &nbsp;2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman emphasizes not to scold or coerce those needing help but show understanding of their circumstances. Help them share in ministry. Assistant congregation servant can show study conductors how to assist those needing help in their groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (4 min.) Assistant congregation servant and conductor go over Publisher’s Record cards of group. Note several irregular in service. Others need help. Following scriptures enable study conductor to get proper balance so he can effectively aid these publishers. (1) Greatest privilege to be a witness, an ambassador for Jehovah. (2 Cor. 5:20) (2) Each one of us a full-time minister —should render whole-souled service. (Col. 3:23) (3) Essential each one make public declaration for own salvation.—Rom. 10:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Study conductor now has right Scriptural foundation so he can help irregular and weaker ones. Note following call being made by study conductor and another publisher on sister who has become irregular in service because of domestic difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (4 min.) Brothers relate helpful points learned recently at “Watchtower” study. Encourage sister to resume attendance and build up joy. Does she have a problem they can help her solve? Sister relates that husband is indifferent, does not cooperate, she cannot get out on weekends, is discouraged. Conductor relates experience of blind sister from Malaya with unbelieving husband and four small children. Because of overwhelming desire to see her four children in new world, she happily renders exclusive devotion to Jehovah and now averages 12 hours each month, (yb 252, 253) Sister profits much from discussion. Definite arrangements made for midweek field service. They leave sister built up, much happier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Any fitting “Yearbook” experience or local experience could be used on these calls. Note how encouraging this is to a brother who has lost his joy due to lack of association at meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (3 min.) Conductor calls on unhappy brother and describes local congregational expansion. Many new faces at hall. Encourages him to start attending meetings and relates “Yearbook” experience. (237 113) Couple with seven children living in Mountain Province in Philippine Republic have not missed a meeting in ten years. Family considers it a serious failure to do God’s will if they miss a meeting. To get to hall requires a four-hour hike under very arduous circumstances. Brother built up, infused with new outlook on life. If his brothers in Philippines can do so well, he can certainly do better. Study conductor arranges to take him in magazine work Saturday and then accompany him to the “Watchtower” study and public talk Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Next, conductor approaches mature sister, enlists her aid to help a sister regain her spirituality. Conductor believes problem lies with her secular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE IV (4 min.) Sister makes call, is a good listener and discerns that problem lies with increased desire for material things. Publisher has lost first love, not progressing toward maturity as once was. “Yearbook,” page 261 UI, illustrates how a family of five in Southern Rhodesia walked fifty-three miles each way over treacherous mountain passes and through dangerous rivers to get to assembly to be baptized. One of group was a woman with a baby on her back. Sister very impressed. Appreciated help. Definite arrangements made to resume study, accompany her to meetings and help her into service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) By giving personal attention to those needing help great strides toward maturity and reaching the 20-percent goal can be achieved. Use of “Yearbook” very helpful. Do not scold the brothers. Build them up and help them to appreciate Jehovah’s loving-kindness and the purpose of our ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">NOTE: Congregations that have a fifth meeting this month will arrange their own fourth meeting so that all congregations will have the following meeting the week of March 24-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">LAST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min; Report from school servant, who is to meet early in March with the congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Preparing New Ones for Service in April (Part 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Directing interested ones to organization and preaching work can result in reaching 20-percerit goal. This should be practiced at each study. Note good results in Pakistan (yb 224 fl2). Let us see how this may be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) After study, publisher recalls conversation of week before (using Matt. 24:14). Each year many thousands begin preaching as commanded by Jesus. Publisher brings out “Yearbook” and shows reports from various countries, on pages 30-37, remarking on worldwide expansion. Work everywhere carried on by preaching from house to house. (Acts 20:20) Invites student to join in work after next study. Student hesitant, does not feel he would know what to say. Publisher states that next week he will have short sermon student can easily use. Leaves handbills for Sunday talk for student to pass out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Lovingly build up Bible students to see importance of work being done worldwide and how they may individually share. Use suggestions at your Bible studies during week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Urge New Ones to Assemble with Jehovah’s People. (Talk based on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The prophet Isaiah declared that in the final part of the days many goodwill persons would encourage others in the worship of Jehovah God, doing so in response to the invitation given by Jehovah’s people. (Isa. 2:3) Today we see an intensive directing-to-the-or-ganization program. An invitation while doing magazine work directed one of Jehovah’s “sheep” to the organization. (258 U3) Invite goodwill persons to the public talk (152 111-3) and to the “Watchtower” study. (274 111) Early and repeated invitations are what bring results. (72 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76 UI)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Invitations to attend Memorial have helped others to see Jehovah’s organization. (269 UI, 2) In many instances the “sheep” are waiting to be invited. Someone invited you; now it is your privilege to invite others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Inviting and Helping Others to Memorial and Special Public Talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) The Memorial and the special public talk will be faith-strengthening and blessed occasions. Have you prepared a list of all who should be invited, such as persons on whom you make back-calls and those with whom you study? The accounts servant is helping by providing the names and addresses of all “Watchtower” and “Awake!” subscribers. The Society is providing- invitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When inviting others, there are primarily three things to inform them of: the occasions, their importance and arrangements for their attendance. (Chairman briefly introduces each of following scenes.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (4 min.) Prepared publisher renews acquaintance, with warm greeting, then says: “We are calling on all ‘Watchtower’ or ‘Awake!’ subscribers to extend an invitation to two important gatherings. When Jesus was on earth he instructed his faithful followers to assemble annually for a memorial celebration of his death. His instruction was: [Read Luke 22: 19.] We would like you to assemble with us on this occasion. [Extend invitation. Point out time and place.] Also, we have arranged for a special Bible lecture on the subject ‘Resurrection—Of a Dead Body or of a Dead Soul, Which?’ [Present handbill.] It will help you to understand clearly God’s promise and what we have to look forward to. It will strengthen your faith to hear this Bible talk. This will be on Sunday, April 7.” (Make arrangements to bring person.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (4 min.) Publisher makes similar invitation to person of goodwill following Bible study. Have householder i;ead Luke 22:19. Discuss Jesus’ command. [Read Memorial invitation.] Make it clear that, of all the meetings at the Kingdom Hall, the Memorial is of most importance because of Jesus’ specific instruction. Make arrangements to call for person and come together to public talk and Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (4 min.) Study conductor calls on publisher who has not been too regular in attending meetings. Give kind greeting and express interest and concern for brother and family. Tell him the reason for your call is to remind him of Memorial. Read and discuss Luke 22:19. Inform him of April 7 talk. Discuss arrangements td pick up family or otherwise help them to get to both meetings. Offer small supply of invitations for family’s use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) If some cannot be reached personally, mail invitations. Let us show sincere, loving concern for all—our brothers and persons of goodwill—and help them be in attendance on these two important and happy occasions. Study conductors should discuss and demonstrate suggested invitation in Scene I at service center March 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FIRST MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Accomplishing Our Lifegiving Ministry Fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on monthly theme. (See “Watchtower,” May 1, 1962, pp. 272276, also issue of April 1, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Preparing New Ones for Service in April (Part 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Having used, with fine results, the good suggestions on building up interest in the service that were given on the two previous service meetings, note carefully how a goodwill person is invited to share in the service durine- April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) After study, publisher refers to previous week’s discussion regarding expansion and notes that it is a pleasure to do the work Jesus and disciples did. (Acts 20:20) To find sheeplike people requires making public declaration. (Rom. 10:10) Student can see importance of helping others learn of Jehovah and the Kingdom hope, but does not feel capable. Publisher shows him little is required to start teaching others, just a simplified discussion of the things learn.ed. Together they go over simplified sermon (or magazine presentation) and student finds he is able to give sermon. Publisher invites him to come along with him Sunday morning and try out this sermon. Student willing. Publisher and student will practice sermon together before going out so student may gain more confidence. Date and time arranged to meet for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Building up new ones in systematic manner enables them to share in the service in April. If you have followed suggestions given over past three weeks, you may have the great privilege of starting a new publisher in the service in April. Twenty-percent goal can be reached with many new praisers to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: ‘Young Men and Virgins,’ Praise Jehovah. (Use young publishers to bring out points in “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The psalmist called on 'young men and virgins, old men together with boys to praise the name of Jehovah.’ (Ps. 148:12, 13) Many young persons use magazine articles and the Society’s books effectively (157 112-158 H3), bear witness to the truthfulness of God’s Word (173 K3), study with schoolmates (207 1il), invite others to meetings (196 ’ll), overcome temptations (189 VI), pioneer (167 Hl), refuse to compromise (223 fl2) and pick right companions (275 113). Through children Jehovah has “furnished praise.” —Matt. 21:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 mln: Question-and-answer discussion of “Fully Share in April’s Activities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Concluding comments. (Include encouragement for all to praise Jehovah, fully sharing in April’s special activities.)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Letters to the Society</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">Any of your correspondence that you want to be given attention by the Society should be addressed to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, not to individuals at Bethel. Mail addressed to individuals should be your personal correspondence and not Society matters; personal correspondence is not handled by the Society. Of course, if your letter is for handling by a certain </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">department</span><span class="font10"> or- contains a handbill order or service reports, you may want to note that, but not an individual’s name, on the lower left-hand corner of the envelope.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1963 Convention Travel Information</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">Anyone who is traveling on one of the Society's tours around the world or to the Holy Land should send his passport by registered mail to the Watch Tower Society, Travel Desk, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, immediately, if he has not already done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The convention in Italy will be held in the city of Milan, rather than Rome, from July 21-28. (For other convention information please see the October, 1962, issue of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LET'S ALL ATTEND!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Attend what? Attend “the principal study of the congregation”! Attend where? At the Kingdom Hall, where Jehovah blesses his congregated people who have cultivated the healthful habit of regular meeting attendance. Attend when? Every Sunday, and particularly March 3, 10, 17 and 24. Why? Because on these dates the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch,-tower</span><span class="font10"> studies cover material that vitally affects everyone who shares in preaching the good news. Surely all the publishers will want to be present on these occasions. If some are sick or infirm, then a mature brother or sister can lovingly study over the material with them so they will not miss out on the benefits of these valuable studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> But what about those with whom studies are being conducted and who may appear ready for field service in April? They, too, should study the vital material in the January 15 and February 1, 1963, issues of i’Zie </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> To this end be sure to invite them to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study each week in March. Why? Because this information will help persons of goodwill to see the responsibility that goes with knowing and preaching the good news of the Kingdom. If one is going to be a minister of the good news, he also has to be a clean person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If, for some reason, some who may soon be ready for service are not able to attend the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">studies during March, then it would be wise to deviate from your regularly scheduled home Bible studies during March and even early in April and cover this material just as we would at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Also, there may be some with whom we conduct home Bible studies who are not quite ready for service in April. What should be done in this case? Keep the procedure mentioned above in mind and preserve these copies so you can discuss this material with them when they are ready for service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> With each and every publisher attending the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> studies during March and with persons of goodwill being helped in the above manner, we will unitedly stretch forward to achieve the 20-percent goal.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> April is truly a special month : There are the Memorial, the special public talk and two special magazines. Moreover, we have a special goal to work toward—the 20-percent increase. How can we fully share in April’s special activities?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Plan </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font10"> to share fully in the ministry. Take advantage of the special activities by vacation pioneering, if at all possible. Arrange for full weekends in the ministry right from the beginning of the month. Be sure to attend the special public talk April 7 and bring goodwill persons with you. Right after the talk the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">will be released and publishers and goodwill persons can get supplies; the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will be available for use on the 13th. Let’s give these fine special issues a wide distribution. Consider now how and when you are going to place your special quota of 30 magazines for the month (pioneers, 120; specials, 180).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Memorial is Monday, April 8. No doubt many publishers desire to share in the ministry this day; so all congregations should arrange a meeting for field service morning and/or afternoon for the convenience of the publishers. If any invitations have not been given out, publishers may do so April 6 and 7. By making definite arrangements to bring persons of goodwill, many more will be in attendance for Memorial. Congregations should arrange to have several friendly brothers in the back of the hall to seat those coming in and to welcome strangers. On con-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> “Look I Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward,” says I’salm 127: 3. An inheritance as precious as this is a serious responsibility. Barents and mature publishers will cooperate in aiding children to have a share in service during March.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">elusion of the Memorial celebration, invite all to obtain copies of the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for distribution.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Overseers, arrange for all irregular publishers to be assisted in service right from the first of the month. Encourage </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> publishers to be out in the service and report by Monday, April 8. The names of any who have not reported by the 8th should be promptly given to study conductors and mature publishers so needed assistance can be provided. May Jehovah’s blessing be upon our determination to share fully in April’s special activities, and may our efforts result in the biggest month yet of praise to His name.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">WHAT </span><span class="font1">HAPPENED HERE IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are pleased to say that January’s 7,578 regular pioneers is the sixth consecutive new peak and an increase of 212. Also, we reached a new peak in Bible studies, with 216,524 reported, and we obtained 116,247 subscriptions, compared to 109,173 last January. The total publisher figure, however, was the lowest since July, 1962. All congregation servants will want to put the fine March and April “Kingdom Ministry’’ suggestions into application so that all publishers are helped out in service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>NEW WORLD NEWS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The news is good. So far this service year reports have come in from 188 lands, and in December 82 reported an increase of 10 percent or better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This has meant a fine increase in number of publishers, as shown here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pubs, in Dec. 1962 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;962,467</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pubs, in Dec. 1961 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;924,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That means 38,467 more publishers in December, 1962. Or, considering the 1962 average, the December report shows an increase of 41,547 already thus service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible studies too are on the increase —up more than 10 percent in a year: Bible studies Dec. 1962 694,906</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dec, 1961 6</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">25,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So there were 69,906 more Bible studies in December, 1962. This is a fine report from around the world!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Announcements</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servants should check and make sure that an order has been submitted for the congregation’s supply of Memorial invitations, handbills for the April 7 talk and sufficient copies of the two special magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation servants will arrange for the accounts servant to list on sheets of paper the names and addresses of all subscribers shown on the Subscription Record sheets since January, 1962. Each sheet should show the name of the publisher obtaining the subscription, and these should be given to the publishers by March 22, so publishers can invite all subscribers to attend the special talk and the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations that attend a circuit assembly on April 7 will hear the regular circuit assembly public talk. These congregations may schedule the special talk for April 14, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> may be released at the circuit assembly. The Memorial report card is being sent to each congregation with the March statement. The congregation servant will please see that it is filled out and put in the mail promptly after the Memorial celebration, April 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It is suggested that congregation servants schedule the meeting for all study conductors March 31, before or after the Sunday meeting, or as near as possible to that date, to discuss: (1) how to aid all publishers to share in April service; (2) how to aid publishers conducting Bible studies to encourage new ones to share; (3) ways to encourage all publishers to share fully in special magazine work and the subscription campaign; (4) the matter of inviting all publishers and goodwill persons to April 7 talk and Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Are you planning now to attend the convention at either New York or Pasadena? An ample quantity of accommodations will be available. Room request forms will be furnished through your congregation in due time. It will be appreciated if all will await the information regarding rooms (hotels and motels, too) until you receive it through your congregation. Please do not write the Society at this time.</span></p>

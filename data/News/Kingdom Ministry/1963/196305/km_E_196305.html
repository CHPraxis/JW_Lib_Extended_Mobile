<p><span class="font7">Keeping Our Friendship with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> “0 </span><span class="font10">Jehovah, who will be a guest In your tent?” Only those who are his friends! One of the requirements for keeping our friendship with God is that we ‘speak the truth in our hearts.’ If we really do this, we will be preachers of God’s truth, speaking what is in our hearts, to help others become friends with God.—Ps. 15:1, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2; </span><span class="font10">Matt. 12:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Few Bible-study aids have been so instrumental in helping others become friends of God as the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let (toi Be True.”</span><span class="font10"> The first edition of this book was 10,557,731 copies, the second 7,752,093, for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font10">total of 18,309,824. No other Society-published book has had such a tremendous circulation. Let us use this fine aid well, trying to spend at least two hours each Sunday in the door-to-door work. Since many householders have </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font10"> publishers should also carry a different 50c bound book with them. When the householder has </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font10"> put the primary emphasis on starting- a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Bible studies are on the increase. Last year we averaged 198,921 studies. In January we had 216,019 and in February the figure jumped to 219,623, In March it was 223,258. This is commendable, brothers. Keep up the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In many cases studies can also be started when householders read only a foreign language, since </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font10"> is published in fifty-three languages. If your congregation does not stock the book in one of these foreign-language editions, it may be ordered from the Society. Even though a householder may read only in his native language, often he speaks enough English so that the publisher can hold a Bible study, the publisher reading the material in English, the householder in his language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> When starting studies, try to do it with the entire family. If it is started with a housewife, try to arrange for it to be held when her husband is home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> To help more share in the Bible study work, we have a new simplified back-call sermon. Remember,</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Invitation to Become Regular Pioneers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Yes, the grand number of over 9,000 vacation pioneer applications were received in March, 1963, compared to 2,726 in March, 1962. What a tremendous army praising Jehovah’s name! The Society would like to take this opportunity to commend all of you for responding so wonderfully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> By the time you get this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> you will have experienced the joys and blessings of vacation pioneering in April. Why not continue to derive such spiritual benefits by extending your vacation pioneer service now?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Serving as a vacation pioneer, one appreciates pioneer service more. Because of the urgency of the times, the Society would like to extend to you a special invitation to become </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a regular pioneer.</span><span class="font10"> To help you, the Society suggests that the followingspecial program be considered by you and all publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> First, analyze your circumstances. Discuss the matter with pioneers and other mature brothers cially to those who are not conducting studies. In many cases, these new ones are soon attending meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Let us not forget those many new ones we started in April. Help them share in the service in May. Also, this month, in those states where Decoration Day is a legal holiday, we will have the opportunity to engage in special magazine work—either from house to house or by doing witnessing in the cemeteries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Yes, by speaking the truth in our hearts and with our mouths, we will not only keep our friendship with God, but turn many from being God’s enemies to being his friends, that they too may be guests of God in his new world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">that have the pioneer spirit at heart. Secondly, the Society suggests that you take the necessary time at home to study the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">supplement for December, 1962, on the pioneer ministry. Arrange for the study of this material in the supplement together as a family.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> After consideration of the material in that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> supplement, approach your congregation servant during May and discuss the matter with him, as well as any problems you may have. He will be pleased to assist you to make out a schedule to pioneer and still care for your other obligations. Congregation servants should be ready to give helpful suggestions and approach different ones they feel can serve as regular pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Finally, take the matter to Jehovah in prayer. Allow yourself to be directed by his spirit to become a regular pioneer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">now,</span><span class="font10"> but, if not, we hope you will be a vacation pioneer again sometime.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Use Simplified Back-Call Sermon to Start Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) In making a back-call we have as our goal starting a Bible study. Use points in “Qualified to Be Ministers,” page 208, paragraph 3. Preparation a necessity. Let’s look in as husband and wife sit down for regular period of study and preparation for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (15 min.) Wife desires a study but feels she cannot give back-call sermon and start study herself. Husband commends on how well she does in service, then points to Society’s suggestion that simplified back-call sermon be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFIT FROM STUDYING GOD’S WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Means everlasting life —John 17:3 Jesus’ work: Making known God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 17:4, 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suggested presentation: “Last time I was here we considered the importance of letting God be true—learning from the Bible. We will gain much from Bible study. It is one of our first steps in pursuit of everlasting life. [Read John 17:3.] Reading on in this chapter (John 17:4), we learn of the work Jesus did when he was on the earth. What was that work? Jesus was interested in making known God’s name. [Read John 17:6.] Many have wondered just what God’s name is. The book ‘Let God Be True,’ which I left you last week, gives some very interesting information on this in chapter 2. Observe the question on paragraphs 1 and 2.” Consider first few paragraphs with householder as circumstances permit. Create interest for return visit. Make definite appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Couple read suggested presentation and discuss it. Husband suggests wife try sermon, using him as householder. Next, he asks how she will start study. She recalls that last point of sermon ties in with chapter 2 of “Let God Be True.” He invites her to start sample study with him. She does well. Now, how will she create interest for return call? She suggests asking question on paragraph 4 but offering to come back next week to consider answer. Wife demonstrates. Makes definite appointment. Husband warmly commends. Suggests they go together on one of her back-calls and she handle it just as she did here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Husbands, spend a period of preparation with your wives as demonstrated here. Parents, do &lt;he same with your children. Companions in the training program should prepare together too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min; Concluding comments. (Include Announcements not yet covered, “New Bible Dictionary,’’ and slogan at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">23 min: Plan Now to Vacation Pioneer This Summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Joyful experiences are in store for vacation pioneers. Younger members of the congregation will find vacation period an opportune time. Older publishers will wisely use summer months to share in this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (3 min.) Two youthful ministers reflect on joys from previous summer vacation pioneering, but, in view of summer conventions, both feel they will not be able to vacation pioneer this sunimer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (4 min.) Parent talks to one child, shows how vacation pioneering will nelp equip him for his career in the ministry.

Child expresses appreciation, and will vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (3 min.) Congregation servant commends young publisher on good field service record, inquires of his plans to vacation pioneer.

<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Let’s encourage one another to vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE IV (6 min.) Two sisters (Will and Hesitate) discuss vacation pioneering. “Will” read many fine “Yearbook” experiences (101, 105, 176) and noted the blessings. She has often thought about vacation pioneering, is determined to this summer. “Hesitate” asks how she will manage with an unbelieving husband, caring for family, and getting to convention. Reminds “Will” she is not getting any younger. “Will” has thought about these things, feels others have overcome greater obstacles, and with Jehovah’s help she will be able to pioneer. Asks “Hesitate,” “Why don’t you vacation pioneer with me?” “Hesitate” never really thought seriously about it. When asked what prevents her from doing so, “Hesitate” replies she really does not have any valid excuse. “Hesitate” decides to vacation pioneer with “Will.” CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Plan now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10 min: Concluding- comments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Faithfulness When ‘One’s Enemies Are in His Household.’ (Talk based on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christian conduct calls for faithfulness at all times, even when ‘one’s enemies are in his household.’ (Matt. 10:36) Not easy, but our brothers are proving faithful under these trials and in many instances have reaped rich rewards. Tn faithfulness wives and husbands have preached despite opposition from unbelieving mates. (223 lil; 224 111) Faithfulness has helped wives win over their husbands (242 115), young men to weather the wrath, of their fathers (251 1(2), boys to endure parental threats and punishment (27f H2), husbands to win over their wives (100 112; 309 U3-310 fl), pave the way for a father and mother and five children to see the truth (167 Faithfulness also carries the grand promise of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Sermon: “God’s Word, an Inspired Guide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (12 min.) Offer the Bible enthusiastically in June. The sermon is simple and to the point. (See “Sermon Outlines,” Section 3A. “Bible.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Informative discussion of introduction, scriptures, transitions and presentation of Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: God’s Word, an Inspired Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible inspired, helps us to meet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">problems of life</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> with success</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—2 Tim. 3:16, 17 Gives us hope for the future (Paraphrase Rom. 15:4) Shows that Kingdom will soon bring peace, security right here on earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Mic. 4:3, 4 Taking in of such knowledge means life &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 17:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suggested introduction: “In these days when there are delinquency and insecurity all around us, you have no doubt asked: What does the future hold for us? Where can we find a reliable guide to help us cope with the problems of life? The best place to go is the Bible, and this scripture shows why.” [Read 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.] Continue with sermon. After reading John </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">17:3, </span><span class="font9">say: “So each one of us needs to read the Bible, but read it with understanding. No doubt you have often said, ‘I wish the Bible were easier to understand.’ Well, it is easier to understand when you read it in the living language of our day. It is just such a modern language Bible I have been using here, aiid it was not a bit difficult to understand, was it? [May well show householder other examples of clear rendering. See Bible insert on “Renderings of Scriptures Compared.”] A copy of this Bible is yours, with this Biblestudy aid, ‘Look! I Am Making All Things New,’ for just $1.” After placement is made, offer to demonstrate for householder how to use the booklet and Bible together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Help for Bible Campaign</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Society is sending all congregations a special aid for the June Bible campaign. This is the four-page “Renderings of Scriptures Compared,” made up of twenty-nine selections from the Bible, showing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font10">rendering alongside those of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Since these aids are for publishers and not the public, one of them can be carefully pasted in the back of your Bible, so it will always be handy when you wish to show a householder how the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Netv World Translation</span><span class="font10"> compares with those other versions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Everyone who gets a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> should receive one of these scripture comparison sheets. Since they are not being stocked by the Society, each publisher should be careful to save his copy. They can be used in future Bible campaigns. If a congregation has a few extra copies, they may be kept on the shelves for new publishers. Put them to good use during the June Bible campaign.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Bible Dictionary</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many will be interested to know that the Society has in stock </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The New Bible Dictionary,</span><span class="font10"> edited by J. D. Douglas. For a one-volume Bible dictionary it is very comprehensive, having 1,375 pages, consisting of 2,300 articles. Its reporting on archaeological discoveries regarding the Scriptures is up to date.

For one thing, you will want to aid him to learu several simple magazine presentations. Then lovingly extend the training to the simplified sermon activity. Commend him for his sincere efforts in Kingdom service and fortify him against indifference and persecution, as well as expecting too much of himself in the beginning. Then, as a true teacher, set a good example yourself in regularity in the ministry and meeting attendance. Be out in the service each week, if possible, and let your student copy</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Society had hoped to obtain the use of the Polo Grounds in New York city at the time of the Yankee Stadium convention this summer. However, it was recently learned that the Polo Grounds will not be available because the new stadium for the Mets baseball games in New York will not be finished by July 7. Due to the great crowd of conven-tioners expected in New York city it will be impossible for Yankee Stadium and the surrounding grounds to accommodate all of them. Therefore, the Society has arranged to use the baseball stadium in Milwaukee. The Society will open the ten weeks’ convention series for this summer’ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, June 30 through July 7. This will mean that a large number of the brothers in the Middle West and in parts of Canada will be attending the convention in Milwaukee and thus relieve overcrowding the Yankee Stadium facilities.</span></p></li>

If you are going to Pasadena, write to 604 N. Avenue C4, Los Angeles 42, California. Please fill out forms completely and be sure you mail them to the convention city where you will be attending the convention.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If any desire certain hotels in which to stay they can show this preference on their Room Request Form. If possible, the Convention Rooming Committee will assign them there. Otherwise, assignments will be given to another hotel in the vicinity at about the same price, if at all possible. By having conventions in three cities in the United States on different dates we feel sure we will be able to accommodate all the brothers. We hope many of the brothers from different parts of the United States, and particularly in the West, and from Texas and Oklahoma, will be going to Pasadena. We would appreciate it if all the brothers would obtain their rooming accommodations through the Watch tower Convention in the three cities.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">Well done, brothers! Outstanding in the March report is the number of subscriptions obtained: 130,960—the highest number ever for a “Watchtower” campaign month! That is an average of almost half a subscription per publisher. Just think what it means! Now “The Watchtower” will be going into many more thousands of homes every two weeks. Why, that many subscriptions represents over 3,000,000 individual copies during the year! It is also wonderful to note that average hours, back-calls and magazines increased during March, and Bible studies increased for the third month in a row. Keep up this fine work.</span></p>

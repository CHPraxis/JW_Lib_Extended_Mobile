<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY, 1963</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”-—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Prove Yourself Approved by Accepting Responsibility</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We all want to say with the apostle Paul, “We are not disapproved.” To do that we must prove ourselves approved by accepting responsibility. A prime responsibility before us all is that of directing others to God’s kingdom as man’s only hope. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine helps us do that, and we should thus count it a privilege to offer subscriptions for it whenever the opportunity presents itself. Undoubtedly, many more subscriptions will result if we all heed the counsel: “Keep proving what you yourselves are.”—2 Cor. 13 : 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Though February is usually the coldest month of the year in most places, we do not want to let inclement weather keep us from accepting Christian responsibility. So dress warmly and select territory that can best be worked in bad weather. Apartments are ideal to work during cold weather; also, many rurals can be worked from the car. When weather rules out regular house-to-house work, we can also make back-calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> It would be excellent if we could work all our territory thoroughly during the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign. We have a valuable aid in obtaining thorough territory coverage. This is the House-to-House Record form. Use it each time you work with the regular offer. If desired, you could use one copy on which to list not-at-homes and another on which to list placements. The notat-home sheet can be given to the brother in charge of the group, if advisable, or used by the publisher the next time the territory is worked. The not-at-home calls can either be made first thing the following Sunday and then the regular house-to-house calls or these calls can be made latei- in the morning after working some territory. If a householder is not home Sunday, try midweek witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Besides wise use of the I-Iouse-to-House Record and general alertness in our ministry, there is another avenue that will open up ways to obtain subscriptions: This is the expiration slip. Have any accumulated with your congregation that have not been cared for? One congregation servant asked the publishers to go through their Bibles, bookbags, and so forth, and turn in to him any expired subscription slips they were holding. In all, he received ninety-six, some dating back to 1955. He gave the slips out to qualified publishers who were anxious to make such calls. As </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font9">result, forty-six subscriptions were obtained. Surely this is an excellent field for subscriptions. When expired subscription slips are received</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A REWARDING DECEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s blessing upon our ministerial efforts is most rewarding. And what blessings we received in December when we enjoyed our highest number of ministers in the field since the all-time peak of 286,908 last. April! Actually, we had 281,108 publishers, a 5.1-percent increase over last year's average. While this is not the desired 10-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">percent increase, yet we are very thankful to see this evidence of expansion. Faithfully, we shall want to aid the new ones on to maturity so they, too, can produce Kingdom fruitage. What a privilege is ours in this respect!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> During December our diligent effort to place Bibles was richly blessed by Jehovah. Our report by the congregation, the Bible study servant should see that they are given out right away and have publishers make the calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It is suggested that each congregation servant ask all publishers to turn in the expired subscription slips that have accumulated, regardless of how old they might be. These will be given to the book study conductors. They, in turn, will see that a call is made on each of the slips. It would be interesting for each congregation to know the number of slips turned in and the number of subscriptions that result from the follow-up. As a further aid for us this month, on the second </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 31 </span><span class="font9">shows 248,710 copies were placed. What a tremendous witness and what a satisfying feeling to have placed the Word of Jehovah in so many homes! All who placed Bibles will want to make return visits to start Bible studies. In fact, it may be that these persons will want to subscribe to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Regular pioneers continue to increase in number. Another new peak was reached in December— 7,366. This is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> fifth month in a row we have had a new peak in regular pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Last December Kingdom publishers averaged 8.9 hours, whereas this December we averaged 9.6 hours. This is commendable, especially in view of the frigid weather in so many parts of the country. For the first four months of this service year publishers averaged 10 hours, whereas last year for this period we averaged 9.5 hours. Servants, study conductors and family heads will want to stress continually the ten-hour goal and help one another to achieve it regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">15 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Prove Yourself Approved by Accepting Responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Demonstration: Following Up AH Subscription Expiration Slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Discuss need to follow up expiration slips immediately, as main article showed how slips can accumulate and get Quite old. Former subscribers once showed interest, so we should be concerned with them. Let us all do this through our service centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (4 min.) In concluding-comments following book study, conductor outlines arrangement for collecting old expiration slips and tells reasons. Special effort to be made during this “Watchtower” campaign to contact all who previously subscribed. Want to be sure our group does everything possible to aid interested ones to resubscribe. Asks all to hunt through bookbags and give him old slips they have. Several are given to him. Additionally, suggests looking in various places such as purses, pockets, Bibles, notebooks, etc., at home. Asks all to have them available at next service meeting so he will have opportunity to get them ready for Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Shows how conductor will sort out slips at home and arrange them in best way for back-call work, which will be done the third hour this coming Sunday or longer if weather is bad. Now watch conductor as he makes these arrangements after text has been discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (8 min.) Conductor displays goodly number of slips. Commends all for thoroughness in locating them. He passes out slips, arranging for mature publisher to go along with less capable so all can share, invites all to observe how these calls are to be made. Prepared publisher demonstrates following introduction: “Good morning,-----. We represent the pub</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">lishers of the Watchtower’ magazine (or ‘Awake!’). We are interested in all persons who are concerned about conditions today and especially those who believe in God’s Word. Tn the past you have read ‘The Watchtower’ and undoubtedly you will recall that it mentioned a war yet to come called Armageddon.” Proceeds with current sermon, draws attention to interesting point in magazine, renews former subscriber’s acquaintance with various features. Now makes offer and says he will be glad to renew subscription so vital information to appear in future issues will not be missed. Householder resubscribes. Publishers are enthusiastic; feel this will result in many resubscribing. Concluding arrangements made by conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Points summarized. Expiration slips often not followed up; special effort to be made during this campaign to correct this. All publishers should cooperate by handing in slips at next congregation book study or next service meeting at latest, and special back-call activity will take place third Sunday of month. 10 min: Concluding comments.

<p><span class="font7">18 min: They Will Fight Against You but “Will Not Prevail.” (Talk based on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Abel to our day Satan and his organization have fought against Jehovah’s people but have not prevailed, because they have been “fighters actually against God.” (Acts 5:39) Jehovah has, in fact, often turned the tables on the wicked. Today the schemes of the wicked still backfire. For example, when a meeting place was stoned, a greater attendance followed. (132 &lt;T2) When missionaries and special pioneers were refused entry into a country, the local brothers rallied together, becoming spiritually stronger thereby. (133 &lt;[3) Fighters of the good news became Kingdom publishers. (150 Hl) A priest is confounded and clergy warnings lead only to greater publicity. (163 ill; 165 111) Priestly mob violence boomerangs. (197 !?2) Destruction of literature, false stories, boycotts and intimidations all backfire on the enemy. (218 fl; 229 fl4: 229 fll-3; 230 fl3: 234 Hl) A funeral service inspires hope and the danger of imprisonment moves to faithfulness. Enemies marvel. (305 fl2; 300 1[4) The fact that Satan and his forces have not and do not prevail is a token of their coming destruction and an assurance of our complete deliverance into a new world.—Jer. 1:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">18 min: Demonstration on “Can You Vacation Pioneer in April?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) April’s increased activity offers an excellent opportunity for many to vacation pioneer. With special magazine distribution, special talk, Memorial activity and 20-percent goal to be reached, vacation pioneering in April is a fine aid in fully accomplishing our ministry. Can you arrange to vacation pioneer in April? Could you be one of these?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (4 min.) Congregation servant approaches a publisher, commending him for increased activity since working out a schedule. Exceeds the quotas each month. Encouraged to further consider schedule to see if he can vacation pioneer in April. Advantages discussed; he is willing and accepts application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (4 min.) Two servants discuss how they can help reach the 20-percent quota for April. No better way than vacation pioneering. This will aid them to work more closely with publishers. Plans are made to vacation pioneer and to invite others to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (4 min.) Two housewives consider their circumstances, with a view to vacation pioneering in April. Children could come along when on their vacation. Better weather, have vacation pioneered before, are conducting Bible studies and feel this is best way to aid these potential publishers into service. One plans to start person in service with whom study was begun during previous vacation pioneer appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Can you fully accomplish your ministry in April by vacation pioneering? Last April over 3,400 did! How many this year? Get an application from the congregation servant. When turning in April’s report, congregation servants will note on the congregation report card the number of vacation pioneers for April. Attend the special meeting with the congregation servant after “Watchtower” study this Sunday when special local arrangements for pioneer activity in April will be discussed. Consider your circumstances and prayerfully try to work out a schedule that will permit you to vacation pioneer during April.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Strengthening the Service Centers (Part 1)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> By regularly visiting the service centers, the congregation overseer can do much to strengthen them. His visits should help him to become well acquainted with the problems and spiritual condition of each publisher. But how can the overseer make these visits most profitable? First of all, he should analyze the Publisher’s Record cards of the group to determine which publishers are doing well and which ones need help. In this way, he is in position both to commend and to encourage. During the time he visits the service center (usually two weeks) he will endeavor to work in the field with each publisher and, if the groups are kept small (from 10 to 12 publishers), this usually can be done. How strengthening it is for the publishers, young and old alike, to be built up by the encouraging counsel of the overseer I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Where overseers note that some are not yet reaching the ten-hour goal, they can work out schedules with such ones either before or after the study, after field service and while visiting the publishers at their homes. Study conductors should always be informed of these developments so they can follow through with these arrangements for best results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> During his visits to the service</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">On Sunday, April 7, a special talk, “Resurrection—Of a Dead Body or of a Dead Soul, Which?” will be given in all congregations. Make arrangements now. Order handbills. A copy of the talk will be sent later for the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Memorial this year will be on April 8, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Printed Memorial invitations may be ordered from the Society using the regular handbill order form. The price is 25c per 1,000; 15c for 500; 10c for 250. Submit your orders for these invitations at the same time as the order for the special public talk handbills, but on separate order forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The April 15 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> will be a special issue and so will the April 22 issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> All will want to give these special issues as wide a distribution as possible. Congregation publishers, plan to place at least 30 magazines in April, pioneers 120 and special pioneers 180. Congregations should ascertain their needs and order now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Our 20-percent goal for April is 320,923. Now is the time to start working toward it by laying the foundation with those with whom we are studying. ♦ Congregation servants are reminded to complete the congregation report and submit it to the Society by the 5th. Special, regular and vacation pioneer reports are to be submitted by the 3d. ♦ On the Sunday following the fourth service meeting in February congrega</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">centers, the overseer will want to check on the progress of the training program and make any adjustments or new assignments to keep the program alive and effective. Also, he will encourage those working under the assistance arrangement to continue to build up the newer and less experienced publishers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Moreover, when visiting service centers, it is advisable for the overseer to note how the study is conducted, the spirit of participation and the alertness of the conductor. Also, observe the effectiveness with which the conductor works with the publishers and how he arranges his meetings for field service. See if he shows genuine concern and love for the sheep. (John 21:15-17) The study conductor should be counseled in private in a loving manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> On the occasion of the last week of the overseer’s visit to the service center, following the study, he will give a short talk to the group offering practical counsel and helpful suggestions on how they can develop greater maturity and improve their ministry. Loving encouragement should mark his talk. The brothers should not be criticized or coerced or made to feel they are not doing all they can. We want to build our brothers up, not tear them down, and this the overseer will always have in mind as he visits the service centers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">tion servants will hold a special meeting, after the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, with all publishers interested in vacation pioneering in April. The purpose of the meeting will be to encourage and assist ones thinking of vacation pioneering to apply, and to arrange field service that will be helpful to those who can vacation pioneer. Suggestions for working out a schedule may also be offered. Congregation servants needing applications should order these immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two eight-day periods that will be of keenest interest to Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States this summer. The New York convention, July 7-14, marks the beginning of an around-the-world series of assemblies for the brothers in the eastern half of the United States, defined by a line extending from the middle of North Dakota to Houston, Texas. Those living in the western half of the country will expect to attend an assembly for eight days in Pasadena, California, from September 1-8. These are going to be the most important eight-day periods on your 1963 agenda. Are you beginning to make your plans now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">COFFER FOR MAY: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> for 50c. FOR JUNE: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> and a booklet for $1.00. Congregations should ascertain their literature needs and order well in advance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Public Meetings for 1963</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many are the benefits we derive from the public meetings. They increase our knowledge, build up our hope and often stimulate newly interested persons to have a Bible study. The 1963 Series of public talks should bring all of us rich spiritual blessings. The titles for the talks are: (1) Relief from Tension in a Troubled World, (2) Death—A Doorway to What? (3) What Hope for Lasting Peace? (4) Are Wicked Spirits Misleading the World? (5) Are the Nations Headed for Armageddon? (6) Does God Have a Name? (7) Does God Favor a Union of All Religions? (8) The Future in the Light of Bible Prophecy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> To aid us in having better prepared talks for 1963, the following is recommended: Congregations that have sufficient speakers need assign only one talk to a brother. This will enable him to have better preparation and to spend more time on his one subject. This should result in very fine talks. Brothers who wish to work up two talks, of course, may do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When a speaker wants his audience to follow along in the Bible, he should allow time or talk slowly enough so that those in attendance have time to look up the text. On occasion the speaker may find it desirable to give the page number in the Bible, such as when he is quoting a key scripture from a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">small Bible book that might be difficult for some to locate.</span><span class="font9"> Bible page number may be given when appropriate ; it is not always necessary.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup>Congregation servants should continue to schedule public meetings regularly during the year. When ordering handbills, please submit the order at least six weeks in advance of the date for the first talk. In addition to brothers with the local congregation, the overseer can arrange for speakers from nearby congregations. At circuit assemblies he has opportunity to exchange speakers with other congregations. At other times he can write nearby congregation servants and work out arrangements. When it is at all possible, speakers should engage in the field ministry Sunday morning with the congregation where they are to give the talk. It is the congregation’s privilege to show Christian hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> When selecting speakers for public talks, keep in mind what </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity</span><span class="font9"> says in paragraph 134. (Have this read.) The committee and school</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Young publishers as well as older ones are carrying on productive back-call and Bible study activity as a result of their good advance preparation. Publishers long in the truth and those newly associated have found that simplicity helps to make the presentation clear and understandable. It may aid you to have an effective share in the work if you give your back-call sermon from just one chapter in the Bible, such as Psalm 37.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> With sincere warmth renew your acquaintance with the person of goodwill. Then you might say: “You no doubt remember that on my previous visit we spoke briefly of God’s war called Armageddon, the destruction of wickedness it will bring and the hope we have of survival.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Recently the Society sent a letter to all circuit and district servants listing places still needing assistance. In this connection you will be happy to know that in the United States we now have one publisher for every 635 persons. There are, however, a number of states needing help, for they have less than one publisher for every 1,000 persons. The “needy areas” are: Mississippi, Tennessee, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Maine. Additionally, states having one publisher for a population of 900 to 1,000 are: Utah, Louisiana, South Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Delaware and New Hampshire.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When working with congregations whose territory is well worked and where there are pioneers and congregation publishers who could possibly move where the need is greater, circuit servants have been requested to encourage such ones to make this move. Many congregations are in dire need of servants and Notice what Psalm 37 has to say about this. [Read verses 10 and 11 and comment on them.] Verses 29 and 31 tell further what God-fearing people have to look forward to and what will direct them in the right way. [Read verses and comment.]” Then point to the cover of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font9"> booklet, read the message from The Publishers inside the cover and consider the first four paragraphs on pages 3 and 4, following through on the suggestions on page 2 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9"> the December and January issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> on starting studies in this booklet. (Publishers who would like to enlarge on the back-call sermon may use the information in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines, </span><span class="font9">Subject 15, Theme C.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■<sup>r</sup>Remember, our goal is to start studies. It is often possible to get into one of the Society’s publications with very little discussion. The sooner you can get into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!&quot; </span><span class="font9">booklet, the sooner you may be studying with a person of goodwill. Prepare well and feed the sheep through regular and effective back-call and Bible study activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">publishers to cover territory. Are you free to transfer to another territory where the need is greater? Can you possibly answer the call? Do you have the faith required to make a move like this? (Heb. 11: 8-10) Have you counted the cost? (Luke 14:28-30) Remember, some of our brothers have planned and worked for several years before achieving this goal. Today their happiness knows no bounds because they have made the move and really feel they are serving where they are both wanted and needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In harmony with the above, if the circuit servant discusses this matter with you, give prayerful consideration to the urgent need for publishers and pioneers in many of these places. If it is not possible for you to move a long distance, perhaps you could move within the circuit. The circuit servant will be happy to give you practical suggestions, regarding transfer to weaker congregations within the circuit.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In the event the circuit servant does not personally contact you, you undoubtedly will want to write to the Society for helpful direction. When writing, please submit a complete report, including your name, address, the congregation or unit with which you are associated, your baptism date, your position of service in the congregation, if any, your secular work capabilities and qualifications, whether you are married or single, a pioneer or a congregation publisher, as well as how many there are in your family, and any other information that will give the Society a clear report on your qualifications. Then the Society will be happy to supply you with information on places that need assistance and that will fit your circumstances. May Jehovah go with you as you prayerfully consider this urgent request.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Obtaining “Watchtower” Subscriptions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Doing all we can in the ministry according to our opportunities and capabilities—this is our keen desire. And this is proper, for the divine will is that God’s ministers “fully accomplish” their ministry. This month, with its many special theocratic features, presents us with grand opportunities. Will we seize them, showing our desire to accomplish our life-giving ministry fully? Indeed we will.—2 Tim. 4 : 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Being aware of the value of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> in our life-giving ministry, we will want to see how we are individually doing in the subscription campaign, now in its climactic month. Publishers who have the “Armageddon” sermon well in mind are doing well in reaching their quota. By arranging to spend time in house-to-house work, subscriptions will be forthcoming; try to spend two hours each week presenting tiie current offer from home to home. Also check through your list of subscription promises; call back on them this month, at the same time not overlooking any uncared-for expiration slips. When you do not find certain householders at home despite several attempts, you might turn the expiration slips over to other publishers who can call at a different time. Or give them to infirm or shut-in publishers who can write a letter. Also, many with whom home Bible studies are being conducted are not subscribers; we will want to see that they have the opportunity to subscribe this month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Continue to help new ones and children in the use of the simplified sermon. It is pleasing to see that many younger publishers and newer ones are using this sermon effectively, thus having a fine part in the subscription work. May all of us, according to our capabilities, accomplish our life-giving ministry fully.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Working for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20-Percent </span><span class="font2">Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> This is the month we all should like to see, as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> result of our fully sharing in the ministry, a 20-percent increase above last year’s average number of publishers. This year winter months have been unusually severe and there has been much sickness, so that many may not have been able to do what they had hoped to accomplish in the ministry. But now with warmer weather and a special month of activity, we shall want to put forth specially zealous and vigorous efforts to accomplish our ministry fully, keeping in mind prospects of a 20-percent. increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup>we are going to reach the 20-percent increase—which is 320,-023—many will need to be assisted</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">to share in the ministry, and many new ones will need to be started. Our records show that about 296,000 publishers have cards in the files, and there are over S,000 regular and special pioneers, making a total of 304,000. To reach the 20-percent goal, all publishers need to be out, and we must start about 20,000 new ones in April. Do we have the potential? Yes, we do. With well over 200,000 Bible studies being conducted, it exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Bible study servants should go through the Bible study file to ascertain which publishers have been conducting studies six months or more; then see what can be done to assist these publishers to start new ones they are studying with to share in the service. Those who have progressed in spiritual growth and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page J<sub>f</sub>, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With Special Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has blessed us with two special magazines. First, the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> which not only exposes false beliefs about the resurrection hope but also fortifies true Christian faith. Besides this inspiring issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> we have the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> showing God’s Word triumphant in this age of science—just what is needed for many who have little or no faith and who need an appreciation of the Bible. Let us be diligent to distribute these grand special issues, all of us trying to reach or exceed our quotas. Publishers have a goal of 30, regular and vacation pioneers, 120, and special pioneers, 180.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> To have full appreciation for these special issues, it is important that each publisher take the time to peruse their contents. You will then present the issues enthusiastically. Parents </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">will help</span><span class="font8"> their children prepare and share in the distribution. Use the special issues also as an aid in starting new ones in the ministry. Try to cover as much of your territory as possible with the special magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Many are the avenues for placing the quota of special magazines. In addition to house-to-house and store-to-store work, opportunities will present themselves for doing street work, car-to-car work at shopping centers ; and, too, all are encouraged to support prestttdy work with the special magazines. Carry magazines with you at all times, and take advantage of opportunities to do incidental witnessing. When the subscription offer is not taken, drop down to two magazines for 10c.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Use the special magazines well. Show enthusiastic appreciation for them. Wherever you place copies, keep a record so you can call back and build up a magazine route. The special issues will stimulate much interest and lay the foundation for many good return visits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12 min: 1963 Conventions, Announcements and New World News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">23 min: Question-and-answer discussion of all three parts of main article, “Accomplish Our Life-giving- Ministry Fully.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">12 min: </span><span class="font7">“Presenting the Good News” —demonstrate points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Congregation Organization” article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Know Your April 22 “Awake!” Magazine. (Make prior announcement so publishers will have special “Awake!” with them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Special “Awake!” contains timely information. Being familiar with the contents will make for effective and appealing presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">DEMONSTRATION (13 min.) Family discuss magazine and highlight articles they will be using. Father asks son which article he will use. He says he will use the article on “The Origin of Life” in discussions with his schoolmates because this disproves the evolution theory. Father asks him to demonstrate how he will present the material and suggests he use his sister as a householder. Model demonstration is then given. Father commends him for his logical presentation and asks daughter which article she will be using and the reason why. She says she will use the article “Your Future in a Scientific World” because there is so much uncertainty in the minds of people about the future. Father asks her to give a model presentation using her brother as a householder. Mother is then asked which article she will be using and she says she is going to highlight the article “Learning from Nature.” She says this really appealed to her and she feels it will be of interest to her back-calls and Bible studies. Father agrees and suggests she adapt the material for a store-to-store presentation. She gives a model presentation using him as the storekeeper. Family then asks father which article he will be using, and he says “Man Reverses Himself—the Bible Triumphs.” 'When questioned why he chose this article, he says so many times people have told him that science contradicts the Bible, and this article presents powerful proofs showing the Bible to be true. The Bible does not need revision, for it has always been in harmony with true science. His wife offers to be the householder, and he gives a model presentation. All members of the family heartily agree that this special issue contains information that will be beneficial to young and old alike. They resolve to place just as many issues of the April 22 “Awake!” as they possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Using the special “Awake!”, present the subscription for “Awake!” along with “The Watchtower” for $2 in the house-to-house work. Encourage those with whom Bible studies are conducted to subscribe. Offer special issues in 30- to 60-second magazine presentations and when the subscription is not taken. Offer magazines on every occasion. Publishers will want to continue to use the special issues until ail the magazines have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Getting All Publishers Out in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) To achieve 20-percent increase in April will require positive, enthusiastic attitude on the part of all servants, study conductors, family heads and publishers. Help and cooperation of all needed. Start early in month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (4 min.) Assistant congregation servant, Brother Bright, gives list of publishers not out in March to Brother Dubious. Not only essential to get new ones out in April to reach goal, but all publishers must be in service too. Assistant wonders if Dubious has followed suggestions in March “Kingdom Ministry” demonstration, “Aiding Each One to Share in Giving the. Witness.” Other conductors did and enjoyed fine results in March. Dubious did not apply instructions in his service center. Why not? He feels his service center different than others. Has a “problem” group. Instructions just do not apply to his group. Assistant inquires if he has particular problem-publisher in mind. Dubious refers to Sister Minnie Difficulties, who has domestic problems, opposing husband and difficult-to-manage children. Together they discuss her situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (5 min.) Assistant and Dubious make call on Sister Difficulties, who pours cut her problems, from uncooperative husband to crying children. They patiently listen, commend sister for efforts despite problems. Encourage her to be patient with husband. Discuss experience in “Yearbook,” pages 163, 164. Sister Minnie Difficulties very impressed. Arrangements made for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Dubious elated over outcome. Appreciates he must change his attitude, overcome his negative approach, be more positive and enthusiastic. Now built up by this experience, Dubious desirous of helping others. Assistant suggests he call on brother who has lost his joy due to lack of association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE TIT (4 min.) Dubious calls on Brother No Joy. Makes call in a confident manner, with keen desire to assist brother back into association and service. Tactfully uses stimulating experience in “Yearbook,” page 211, in connection with reviving inactive ones. Points well illustrated that staying away from meetings and service does not solve any problems but just multiplies them. Definite arrangements made for attending “Watchtower” study that Sunday and participating in service. No Joy is infused with new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE IV (3 min.) Dubious thanks assistant for all the encouragement. Now sees that to be successful as servant and contribute to 20-percent increase he should have better outlook. (1) Should be more positive and enthusiastic about aiding publishers to follow practical counsel from “Kingdom Ministry.” (2) Should set good example himself. (3) Should have definite plan to help those with problems. Prepare Scriptural arguments or use local or “Yearbook” experiences to highlight points. (4) Should enlist aid of other brothers and sisters in group to help keep all regular and happy in service. In short, he should no longer be dubious, but have bright outlook on expansion. Assistant commends Dubious and looks forward to hearing of good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on slogan at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Report from two or three study conductors covering visit with congregation servant. They will outline what they will do during the remaining days in April to see that all are out in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">17 rnin: Assist Entire Families to “Serve Jehovah.” (Discuss and demonstrate points made in 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses’ successor Joshua declared that 'he and his household would serve Jehovah.’ (Josh. 24:15) We, too, want whole households to serve Jehovah. Some ministers have had excellent results by giving this point some thought and attention. A man who opposed a sister listened when a brother talked to him. (131 1f4) A Hindu youth persuaded his father and family to study the Bible. (96 til) Special attention to a husband calmed his violent nature. (77 *13) A study started with children made way for parents to join later. (266 fi2, 138 U2-139 U2; 295 1,3-296 111) A brother by being present opened a way for the father and sons to join a study. (299 Hl) If we give this point of service our greatest care, more fathers will be able to say as did Joshua: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">18 min: Build Up New Ones for Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Preparing new ones for service is one step, taking them in service is another. Both are essential. Progressive training requires follow-through and continuous loving aid to see that new publishers are assisted in the service. Last month one studied with was built up to the point of sharing in service. Watch now as student is taken in magazine work for first time. (Same publishers as in March may be used.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (5 min.) Publisher and Bible student in field service approach first door. Publisher mentions need to be friendly, warm and enthusiastic, for we are searching out sheeplike people. At first door publisher gives magazine presentation using special issue of “Watchtower” and householder shows definite lack of interest as he rejects offer. Student says, “It does not appear everyone is interested in the message.” Publisher agrees and refers student to Romans 10:16 to show that we preach to all even though, like the nation of Israel, “they did not all obey the good news.” They go to another house, and publisher again presents magazines. This time magazines are taken and interest is shown. After leaving, publisher and student express pleasure at finding-interested person. Publisher suggests, “You may want to try a door or two now to give the presentation we prepared together.” Student reluctant and says, “Please do a. few more doors.” Publisher agrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Publisher now takes a few more homes. Student, listening, builds up confidence.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1963 Unassigned Territory Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> During 1962 territory in the United States was more thoroughly covered than ever before. Congregation publishers, vacation, regular and special pioneers ail had a part, and because of their very fine efforts tens of thousands living in unassigned territory heard the good news, with many responding to the point that they are publishers today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Congregations and pioneers who held an assignment last year are requested to ask for the same assignment this year. Being acquainted with the territory and some persons of goodwill living in it will save much valuable time and make for the most efficiency. If your congregation did not work unassigned territory last year—or as a regular or vacation pioneer you would be able to do so apart, from the congregation you are with, consult the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (3 min.) Publisher again asks student, who is now willing and takes next door. In his unpolished but sincere manner he makes presentation. Householder takes magazines. Student is pleased and is encouraged to try some more. They then go on working, taking turns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Student has now shared in giving the witness. He has started, but encouragement and commendation will be needed to build him up to continue in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (2 min.) Last house completed. Publisher warmly commends student for good effort and encourages him to continue making progress in future. Shows how Paul encouraged Timothy to make progress in lifesaving work; reads 1 Timothy 4:15, 16. They make definite appointment to work together again. After next study publisher will help student with simplified sermon. Student pleased with help and is enthusiastic about going in field service again,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Starting new ones in service is just the beginning. Continued loving assistance is needed in order that they may progress to maturity. Start new ones in service in April to reach the 20-percent increase and assist them regularly in the months ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Keeping Our Friendship with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Talk on theme for month. (See '‘Watchtower/’ February 15, 1962, pp. 110-116, also issue of May 1, 1963.) 17 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “Benefits from Pioneering,” in December “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1S min: Sermon: Religion—-True and False</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Displays outline of new sermon on blackboard and encourages all to learn it well. Sermon is especially designed for use with “Let God Be True” book. Discusses sermon, step by step, with audience. Helpful thoughts are brought out by both audience and chairman on introduction, transitions between scriptures and transition to book offer. </span><span class="font8">booklet on unassigned territory in the congregation file along with the supplement showing changes, which are being sent to all congregations during March. Select the territory you would like to work and submit &quot;the application for unassigned territory to the Society by May 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> With the assemblies this summer, congregations in the west will want to concentrate on working unassigned territory during July and August. Congregations in the east will be able to do most of their work August and September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of the fine effort put forth last year there are now only a little over eight hundred counties or parts of counties that remain unassigned. This is a reduction in number of almost one hundred counties in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">one year's time.</span><span class="font8"> Excellent I Let us continue the fine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: Religion—True and False Not all religion true &nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 15:7-9</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Exposing false religion protects</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">sheep &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 15:14</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Paul changed to true —Gal. 1:13, 14 Follow what God says is true</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">—Rom. 3:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suggested introduction and transitions: “We are calling at each home and speaking just briefly to those who still have a love for God and a deep respect for his Word. We often hear it said, ‘It makes no difference what religion you belong to as these religions are like different roads that lead to the same destination.’ So people wonder, Does the Bible really teach that any religion is ail right, or is it possible that one person’s religion could be false and another’s true? Jesus showed clearly that there is such a thing as false religion and he condemned it. Notice what he says here at Matthew 15:7-9. [Read verses.] Why was Jesus so outspoken in exposing what he knew to be wrong? He had a loving purpose in this. He had concern for and wanted to protect sheeplike ones. [Read Matthew 15:14.] He did not want persons of goodwill led astray. Does this mean that one should change his views if he discovered that what he believed was not true? The apostle Paul was willing to make that change. [Read Galatians 1:13, 14.] Paul changed from a persecutor to a supporter of Christianity. But what should be our goal in all of this? The goal should be to get God’s mind on the matter and appreciate that what he says in his Word is always true no matter what men teach. [Read Romans 3:3, 4.] Sincere persons welcome assistance in their search to find the truths of God’s Word. One of the finest Biblestudy aids ever produced to assist in this is the book ‘Let God Be True.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">DEMONSTRATION (5 min.) Well-rehearsed sermon demonstrates its thought-provoking qualities. Book is placed and publisher offers to point out how newly acquired aid can best be used in studying Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Each publisher is encouraged to have full share in distributing “Let God Be True” during May. All should be alert to start home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are now making plans to attend conventions this summer, with those in the eastern half of the country undoubtedly planning to attend the assembly in New York, while those in the western half w’ill assemble in Pasadena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> As to rooming accommodations, the Society is mailing to each congregation Room Request forms. Do not write letters in place of using the form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Those planning to attend the New York assembly should fill out these forms and start mailing them to the convention address in New York during April. Those attending the Pasadena assembly need not mail them until June. Congregation servants should discuss, at one of the service meetings ten to twelve weeks prior to the convention date, the instructions attached to each form.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Volunteer Service forms are also being sent to the congregation, and those desiring to render service on behalf of their brothers will want to fill out the form completely. Return it to the congregation servant, who will sign it and forward it to the convention city where you desire to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The Society is preparing attractive lapel cards to fit the holders you have been using. Congregation servants should ascertain local needs and order an adequate quantity, as well as celluloid holders. The cards are one cent each; the holders, five cents each.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> This year the Society will be providing two car signs, one designed for each city, which you may put on the back of your automobile en route to New York or Pasadena respectively. The signs will be approximately </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">4i&quot;</span><span class="font8"> x 20&quot; in size, attractively designed. They will provide good identification as well as advertising. The sign can be readily applied by merely removing the paper coating on the back and then sticking it on any clean surface, such as the bumper. It will not harm such surfaces. If one wishes, it could be applied to a board and then fastened to the bumper or back of the car. These signs will be available for ten cents each. Congregation servants should ascertain their requirements and order the ear signs for New York or Pasadena at the same time they submit an order for lapel cards. Order after May 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Give thought now to preliminary preparations for attending an assembly and to arranging for the accommodations you require, sending the forms to the proper city at Ihe right time.</span></p>

O Brothers from the United States and Canada who are going on convention tours abroad this year should keep in mind that for their rooming accommodations in New York and Pasadena they must make request through the Watchtower Convention Rooming Committee just as others attending there. These brothers should note on their Room Request form for Pasadena that they will be traveling abroad, and they should show the date they will leave home. If their assignment for Pasadena cannot be sent to them before their departure date, it will be held for them at the Pasadena rooming office pending their arrival. The Society has booked hotel space for world travelers in all other countries, if they are on the regular Society tour.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Another new peak in regular pioneers—the seventh month in a row! That is the striking feature of our February report along with a new peak in Bible studies, namely, 219,623. Let’s all work hard to make April the most outstanding month of the year in all features of activity.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Any publishers who have not been out and who have not reported by April 8 should be given loving attention and help. The assistant congregation servant will supply each study conductor with the names of publishers who have not been out. Each study conductor should have as his goal all publishers with his group sharing in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Study conductors may wish to arrange to stop at the homes of publishers who have not been out by April 21, right after the meeting for field service, and invite these publishers to join them in the field ministry that very morning. This can also be done Saturday, April 2&quot;, and Sunday, April 28. Undoubtedly, those needing assistance will appreciate this loving help and be able to go out for at least an hour. If the one being called on is not ready for service, the one calling can work in nearby territory for fifteen minutes or so and come back when the publisher states he will be ready. Vacation pioneers and publishers doing midweek service can also be used to assist ones not able to share in weekend service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Many publishers will be vacation pioneering in April. If the number of publishers and vacation pioneers equals the 20-percent quota for the congregation, “We made it 1” may be put on the congregation report card.</span></p></li></ul>

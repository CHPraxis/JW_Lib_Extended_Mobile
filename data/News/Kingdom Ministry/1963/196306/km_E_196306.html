<p><span class="font9">i “The Word of God,” Jesus Christ, is our God-given Model and Exemplar. As “the Faithful Witness,” he set the fine example by seizing every opportunity to make known God’s will. We can be true witnesses like the “Word of God” by grasping all opportunities to present the Bible to others, then helping them appreciate and understand what God’s will is for mankind. —Rev. 1:5; 19:13; John 4:5-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Because of oui’ diligent -work in placing Bibles last December, the Society produced, in 1962, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> in greater number than any other bound book. That is excellent! Will this happen again in 1963? It is up to all of us to get behind the distribution of the Bible, and, Jehovah willing, we will see another excellent distribution of his inspired Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> To attain that we will need to be prepared to give either the simplified sermon or the regular sermon. Parents, of course, will want to see that their children are assisted; and all publishers who started new ones in service will render loving assistance in aiding them to engage in the ministry again this month. To aid us in placing the Bible, we have the four-page “Renderings of Scriptures Compared,” which will help us show others the great advantage in having the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New WorldTranslation.</span><span class="font9"> Take good care of your copy of this folder, pasting it neatly in the back of your Bible. Then it will always be available for use, not only during June, but also at other times. If you have territory not worked with the Bible last December, try to cover it during June. And as we begin this campaign it will be well to examine the Bibles we have at home and in oui<sup>-</sup> book bags, to make certain that, when presented to householders, they are unsoiled and of clean appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Many were the persons who obtained subscriptions during the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign, and no doubt many of these will desire a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation. </span><span class="font9">Have in mind starting a study with these subscribers; and whenever you place the Bible during the month, try to get a study started</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JUNE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures” and a booklet, for $1. <sub>t</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Did oui- April activity have the blessing and approval of Jehovah? Indeed so I Truly he made his face shine upon us and favored us with a magnificent report in many ways. —Ps. 67 :1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Outstandingly of interest is the publisher increase. For the first time in the United States, we exceeded 300,000 publishers in the field. Our report showed 308,370 publishers—a 15.3-percent increase. This is a fine increase, especially when we reflect that in December our increase stood at 5.1 percent. Our April’s increase means that we have 21,462 more publishers praising Jehovah than during any previous month! How much Kingdom preaching can be done in the days to come by 21,462 persons I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Congregations to the number of 1,376 reported “We made it!” Of great help to the congregations has been the record number of vacation pioneers. During April we had 10,379! This is more than twice as high as the previous peak month! Stimulated by the vacation and regThis is the most effective way to help these people learn the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We are making excellent progress in Bible study work; in fact, we had the highest number of Bible studies ever reported for three consecutive months—January, February and March. This is commendable. Those conducting more studies than they are able to care for should turn some over to other publishers. (Check with the Bible study servant as to who are looking for studies.) Also, it would be well for experienced publishers to take others along with them to train them in conducting studies, turning studies over to them. All publishers will want to have in mind the goal of conducting at least one Bible </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font9"> 2, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font9"> 3) ular pioneers and because </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9"> the excellent work of the publishers, we reached new peaks of all kinds.

<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of “The Around-the-World Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Put Forth Effort to Assemble Together. (Talk based on 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Hezekiah’s day much effort was put forth to get the people to assemble at Jerusalem to celebrate the pass-over. Only individuals who humbled themselves responded, however. (2 Chron. 30:5-13) Today this is still true. Only the truly humble appreciate the need to assemble together, are willing to put forth extra effort and make sacrifices to this end. Some have walked three days to attend an assembly, others have walked 300 miles, still others have cycled 375 miles. (106 112; 222 U2; 261 (11) Parents with seven children have not missed a meeting in ten years, though it is a four-hour hike to the Kingdom Hall from their house. (237 112) Some have chartered buses. (256 113; 187 f[2) Others have quit their jobs to attend, while still others have pooled their finances to see that the needy assemble with them. (129 HI; 177 fl3) Those who put forth special effort to assemble are always made happy for it. Jehovah blesses them with his spirit and they rejoice for having done as he has commanded.—Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Demonstration: Witnessing en Route to and from Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) There will be many opportunities to witness traveling to and from the conventions. Car signs and lapel badges will identify delegates. Have appropriate literature and witness on every occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (3 min.) Family witnesses to various ones at gas station while car is being serviced. Brief explanation is given about the around-the-world-assembly arrangements. Use simplified sermon to present regular offer. If offer refused, present two magazines for ten cents. Make use of tracts as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE' II (3 min.) Many traveling by train, bus and airplane. Demonstrate opportunities to direct conversation to provide an opportunity to witness. Always have a good supply of tracts available for use in the event other literature is not placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (3 min.) Demonstrate how witness can be given at motels and restaurants to employees or guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Take advantage of opportunities to witness to householder you are staying with. Our appearance and conduct should be exemplary. Summarize good results that will be obtained from all taking advantage of every opportunity to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min; Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NOTE: Congregations that will not be attending the New York or the Milwaukee assembly will use this convention material two or three weeks before the date of the Pasadena, assembly. In place of the meeting regarding the assembly, congregations will arrange a service meeting dealing with Bible studies. Have a talk on the importance of all sharing in the Bible study work, a demonstration showing various ways that Bible studies can be started and perhaps some interesting experiences in connection with Bible study work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">15 min: Concluding comments. (Congregation servant will handle pertinent items in the Announcements column.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Preserving Our Souls Alive by Faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on month’s theme. (See “Watchtower,” December 15, 1962, pp. 748-758, also issue of July 1, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Witness to “Relatives and Intimate Friends.” (Discuss and demonstrate points made in 1963 “Yearbook” experiences.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even though Jesus said: “A prophet is not unhonored except in his home territory and in his own house,” this does not mean that he did not preach the Kingdom to his relatives and intimate friends. (Matt. 13:57) Many of Jesus’ own relatives became baptized Christians. Mary, Martha and Dazarus belonged to one family. When Cornelius was expecting Peter, he “called together his relatives and intimate friends” to hear what Peter had to say. (Acts 10:24) As early Christians made sure their relatives and friends heard the truth, modern-day Christians who do the same are richly blessed for it. The mother of a man of goodwill embraced the truth because arrangements were made to call on her. (227 Hl) A visit to relatives mushroomed into fourteen studies. (186 fl4, demonstrate) By letter writing some have come to embrace the truth. (86 113) Relatives in another country embraced the truth after one of the family made a special trip to witness to them. (169 112) A tactful, friendly visit broke down prejudice and opened a door for a Bible study. (184 J[4) Have persons of goodwill take you to their relatives. Easy way to start a Bible study. (255 113, demonstrate) What could be nicer than to have intimate friends and relatives enjoying the same hope of life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: New Sermon: “Let Your Name Be Sanctified.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three-month campaign with the books “Let Your Name Be Sanctified” and “Your Will Be Done on Earth” requires knowledge of sermon for greatest effectiveness. Prepare early and use often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Discuss with audience sermon and use of scriptures. Suggested sermon: ‘Many pray the Lord’s Prayer and ask that God’s name be hallowed or sanctified. They pray, [Quote or read Matthew 6:9]. Perhaps you have too. But what is God’s name? The answer is found at Psalm 83:18. [Read.] The Almighty God has a name just as Jesus did and as you and I do. The importance of knowing his name is made clear at Romans 10:13, 14. [Read.] We have come to call on you with the purpose of sharing good news regarding God’s name and his purpose to bring righteous conditions to the earth in answer to our prayer. [Quote or read Matthew 6:10.] This Bible aid, “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” highlights God’s name and shows how it will eventually be restored to its rightful position and cleared of reproach.’ Appropriate point in book may be pointed to and then two books offered on a contribution of $1.00, with two booklets given free. “Look!” or “Good News” booklet should be placed as one of two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CAPABLE PUBLISHER (8 min.) Gives well-prepared sermon. Starts study in booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Knowing sermon and having effective presentation essential. Also try to start studies. Keep accurate records of interest and follow up placements promptly. 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Many publishers will be vacation pioneering this month; for their benefit and that of those who can do midweek service, each congregation should arrange for meetings for field service during the week. Whatever our opportunities during June, seize them, use them to God’s glory. Be true witnesses like the “Word of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The week after your congregation attends the assembly, at least a half hour of the service meeting program will be devoted to a review of assembly highlights. It should be carefully planned in advance by the congregation servant and he may adjust the program to allow time for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Offer for July-September: “Let </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Your Name Be Sanctified”</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font8"> for $1.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE AROUND-THE-WORLD ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people are looking forward to assembling this summer as the around-the-world assembly starts in Milwaukee, June 30-July 7, goes to New York for July 7-1.4 and then later concludes in Pasadena, September 1-8. The question is, Will you be attending at one of these cities?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Rooming</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Now is the time to make plans for attending the assembly at Milwaukee or New York. If you have not sent in your request for rooming accommodations, do so right away. Do not forget to include goodwill persons as well in these plans.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The publ ishers in Milwaukee and New York are busily engaged in securing rooming accommodations, a happy responsibility that they have accepted. The rates in private homes are reasonable. Wherever possible assignments will be mailed to you directly. If, however, you do not receive an assignment before you leave home, you may obtain it at the rooming department in the convention city. Be sure you write down the address of your rooming accommodation on a slip of paper and put it in your wallet so you will not lose it. Carry it with you during the entire assembly; do not trust your memory or depend upon others. Frequently people have lost the address and did not know where to go.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> It is going to be extremely important that the brothers living in the east-central states, such as Ohio and Michigan, attend the assembly in New York city if at all possible, because the facilities in Milwaukee are much smaller. In fact, if those from the midwest states listed in the May </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry</span><span class="font9"> and the special letter to the congregations go to Milwaukee, the facilities will be filled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If some of those attending the assembly at New York receive a rooming assignment with a New Jersey address, this does not mean that one is far removed from Yankee Stadium. In fact, it will be closer to the stadium than many accommodations in the city itself. These accommodations will in many cases be better than others, and for this reason the brothers in that area are securing rooms for your benefit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Several have inquired about trailer camps. There will be none at any of the convention cities this summer, but you can keep in mind that the convention rooming department will have good rooms listed at reasonable rates.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Field Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Inasmuch as the summer offer is two bound books on a one dollar contribution, why not be prepared to share in the witness work en route to New York and Milwaukee? You can be equipped to tell others about the good news in this manner. Keep an accurate record of the time spent in incidental witnessing and include it in your July report. If you are not returning home during July, you should arrange to send your field service time to someone in your home congregation so it can be included in the July report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> To facilitate field service while in New York, there will be a number of Kingdom Halls at which territories can be procured. One of these will be relatively close to where you will have your room.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Elderly People</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Elderly people who require assistance going to and from the stadium should make arrangements for assistance with those they know from their local congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneer Meal Tickets</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Pioneers should be sure to bring their meal ticket with them, as it will serve as identification and enable them to obtain literature at pioneer rates. Do not expect the convention to issue another meal ticket at the convention city. These should be carefully kept in one’s wallet, the same as money.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Assembly Badges</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Attractive badges have been printed by the Society. So that all those in your congregation attending the assembly may have one, the congregation servant should be certain that he orders an ample supply of them from the Society right away. The cards are one cent each. They may be worn by all conventioners from the time they leave home en route to the convention until the convention is over. The assembly badge should be kept in a celluloid card holder to keep it clean. The holders cost five cents each. Please order these immediately if you have not done so. You should type or print the individual’s name and congregation represented on the front of the card. You may show the city and state. It will be very helpful if the congregation servant will supervise this matter so all will be done neatly and legibly. Wearing these cards and the badges will be an excellent way through which you can become acquainted with others and advertise the assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Car Signs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> The Society is providing car signs to be used on automobiles en route to the convention city. The signs will be approximately 4% inches by 20 inches in size, attractively designed, using fluorescent colors. They will serve as a fine means of advertising the assembly, besides providing identification. The sign is easily applied by removing a protective coating on the back and then sticking it on any clean surface such as the bumper. It will not harm these surfaces. It will stick to irregular surfaces or areas. The sign may be applied to a board or firm material and then fastened to the bumper, if one so wishes. These are available for ten cents. The congregation should order a good supply of these right away to take care of your needs, making certain to indicate which convention city is desired.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> Have you sent in your volunteer service application? Not only is it a privilege to attend the assembly, but it is also a splendid opportunity to serve your brothers by volunteering to work in one of the departments. Thousands of volunteers will be needed. This year the Society has established a minimum age for volunteer workers at conventions. You must be at least fourteen years of age. Anyone thirteen or under will not be accepted for volunteer service. Those of this age and younger should be with their parents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Spanish Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> A complete eight-day program in the Spanish language will be conducted in conjunction with the assembly in New York. Such meetings will all be held in the nearby New Rockland Palace at 155th Street and 8th Avenue. A similar Spanish program is planned for the Pasadena assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Note</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

One of the best reasons for doing so is given here at John 17:3. [Read.] Bible knowledge can lead to everlasting life.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Suggestions for Baptismal Candidates</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Of greatest importance to a Christian is faithfully doing Jehovah’s will. It is God’s will that we follow the example of his Son, who symbolized by water baptism his dedication to do the will of the heavenly Father. Yet there are nearly 85,000 Kingdom publishers in the United States who have not yet taken this vital step in compliance with God’s will. All of these should be seriously considering getting baptized at the earliest opportunity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Conveniently, there will be an immersion at each of the assemblies this summer. A baptism is scheduled at each circuit assembly too. Of course, if it is not possible for one to be present, local arrangements can be made. But one who wants to serve God is not going to hold back indifferently. He will put forth an effort to avail himself of the opportunities provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Those contemplating baptism should first give careful consideration to the material in the June </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> on this subject. Par-discussed the thought that the Bible is an inspired guide. Well, then, where will it guide one? Do you remember the answer given at John 17:3?” Pause for reply; then say, “It is everlasting life to which one will be guided. Reading on in this chapter (John 17:4), we learn of the work Jesus did when he was on the earth. What was that work? Jesus was interested in making known God’s name. [Read John 17:6.] Many have wondered just what God’s name is. The booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good Hews of the Kingdom,’ </span><span class="font9">which I left with you last week, gives some very interesting information concerning this on page 5. The question on paragraph 5 asks . . . ” Continue with study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> June will provide us with excellent opportunities to present the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> and aid men of goodwill to appreciate God’s inspired Guide. We can use the simplified house-to-house and back-call sermons, as appropriate, to accomplish this.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">ents will want to help their teenage children understand this material if they are thinking of being baptized, and publishers conducting studies should assist the persons with whom they study. Candidates must be morally clean. Each one who will be baptized is entering by a prayerful vow into an eternal obligation to Jehovah. The urgings and wishes of friends and relatives should not enter into the decision. Your dedication is to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> You should carefully note the date of your immersion. Inform the congregation servant, so this date will be shown on your Publisher’s Record card and so you will receive your copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching and Teaching in Peace and Unity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Finally, all baptized publishers should make every effort to gain maturity. To this end each newly-baptized one should continue his study of the books </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font9"> until completed. If you are seriously contemplating baptism, prayerfully consider this all-important step; then do the divine will without delay.</span></p></li></ul>

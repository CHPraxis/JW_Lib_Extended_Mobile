<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HEAL WITH BIBLE STUDIES!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Strive for a Special Goal by the End of December</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Spiritual sicknesses afflict the masses. Satan the Devil has brought about these sicknesses of mind and heart. What is the remedy? It is the healing balm of God’s unfolded Word, known also as “the healthful teaching according to the glorious good news of the happy God.” —1 Tim. 1:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> True, not all wish to be healed. In these last days we find many who “will not put up with the healthful teaching.” But many persons want to be healed. They long to hear the “good tidings” that bind up the brokenhearted, that proclaim “the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God,” and that “comfort all that mourn.” But who will go to these people with the healing, “healthful words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ”?—2 Tim. 4:3; Isa. 61:1, 2, AS; 1 Tim. 6: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The New' World society of Kingdom ministers has long been engaged in this healing Work. From the fine results these ministers have enjoyed they know the healing value of Bible studies. They know this is the most effective way to promote spiritual healing. Yet only one third of the Kingdom publishers conducted studies last year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We have, then, a special goal— attaining more Kingdom ministers to do healing with Bible studies. How many? At least two thirds of the publishers by December 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Let placements this month help you pave the way for Bible studies. The offer for the month is a bound book and a booklet for 50c. Congregation servants should check the congregation supply of literature. If a large supply of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font12"> is found, publishers should be encouraged </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12"> feature these books. Some publishers may prefer to make a bigger offer, and the Society suggests one bound book and one booklet and Volume I of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> on a contribution of $1.50. The Society has an extra supply of this volume. For November and December, 1957, it can be placed in combination with another book on a $1.00 contribution instead of $1.50. Congregation publishers can get Volume I of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> at the stock room at 90c, and pioneers at 50c. Congregations will ask for credit on their account at the end of November and December</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">BETTER </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AND MORE BACK-CALLS AND BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> God’s will “is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” What is the most effective way for God’s servants to carry out his will? The Kingdom ministry, of course, but especially the Bible-study feature of our service.—1 Tim. 2: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Surely there is no more thorough way to bring good-will persons “to an accurate knowledge of truth” than by Bible studies. Why, then, are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I OFFER FOR NOVEMBER 'Any bound book and booklet for 50c, ,or Vol. I (NW), a book and a booklet I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for $1.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; THEME FOR NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Heal Sicknesses of Mind and Heart —Isa. 61:1-3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">not more Kingdom ministers conducting them? Why should so vital a service be neglected by two thirds of the Kingdom publishers? Why are only one third of the publishers at present conducting them? These are searching questions, questions we for copies placed at rates lower than usual. Order what you need right away.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> What can we do further to lay a foundation for new Bible studies? Be well acquainted with the sermon “A New World.” Practice it. It is “healthful teaching” to which the brokenhearted will respond. Keep a record of placements. Make back-calls, too, on subscribers for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What of those persons who are already studying and whose healing is advanced? Start them speaking “healthful words” during November. Have in mind the 10-percent increase by the end of December. May Bible study conductors be at least two thirds of the publishers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">should ask ourselves. How would you answer them ?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Could it be that placements are not being adequately followed up? Placements are fertile soil for back-calls, and back-calls are the bafeis for home Bible studies. So in pushing toward our goal of two thirds of the publishers conducting studies by the end of December we need more publishers making better and more back-calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> For better back-calls we need a back-call sermon; better yet, several of them. We need to know our sermons well and enthusiastically explain God’s truth. The back-call sermon should have an objective; it should stir up interest and lead effectively into a home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> More back-calls will require better personal organization. Do you set aside time for the back-call work? All study conductors should arrange definite back-call activity. But not all may be able to share in the evening </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 4, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Heal Sicknesses of Mind and Heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Talk on “Heal Sicknesses of Mind and Heart.” (See “Watchtower,” 11/1/57, p. 656, and 3/1/56, p. 139.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">23 min: “Presenting the Good News.” School servant to discuss this with congregation, demonstrating the points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk on main article, “Heal with Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Col. 1:10] at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, on Life, page 246, Christ Granted Immortal Life for His Faithful Course, to 1 Thess. 4: 16 on page 248. To be handled by questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">A report in talk form from the Bible study servant, covering points in “Congregation Organization.” 25 min: Develop and demonstrate a model back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(15 min.) In the development of this demonstration, follow the method described in the first meeting in October. Show the necessity of having pleasant introductory words and a variety of approaches on return calls. Also show the need of having something to say, taking the initiative at the door and being flexible to the circumstances. In developing this demonstration have the audience use words of their own, not necessarily the words and phrases outlined in the “Kingdom Ministry.” Have them use words and thoughts that come natural to them. If they first get a. clear mental picture of the entire sermon, the transitions will be smooth and their speech will be coherent from beginning to end. For example, a publisher might say: “Good evening, I’m so happy to find you home. The last time I was here we talked about the Bible’s promise of a new world. Well, I’ve looked up some very interesting scriptures that make that new world a reality. They tell of the joy, peace and happiness people will enjoy in the new world. I came over because I know you would like to hear them. May I step in for a few moments?” If the householder agrees, go in and give your sermon. But if the householder should hesitate or say “no,” be prepared to give your sermon at the door. Refresh her mind by going over a few points from your three- to eight-minute sermon, then continue with your back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: A Righteous New Earth for Mankind</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1. No time to fret because of evil ones &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Psalm 37: 1, 2</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2, Wicked destroyed, meek possess earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Psalm 37: 10, 11</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3. Peace when oppressors gone</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Psalm 72: 1-8</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4. No more war—Micah 4: 3, 4 now being fulfilled, new earth greater scale.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Dead raised to life—John 5: 28, 29 6. No more sorrow, pain or death</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Revelation 21: 3-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7, Perfect, enduring world. God will satisfy all desires &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Psalm</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">145: 15-20</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This booklet, “This Good News I of the Kingdom”, (or book, “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” or “Let God Be True”, or “New Heavens and a New Earth”), gives further information about this promised new world. Take, for example, this first paragraph in the booklet (hand a copy of the booklet opened to page over to the householder) asks these questions. Read the paragraph and then ask the question at the bottom of the page. Get the householder to comment on the paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Demonstrate how one can beneficially study by using this method. Take up three or four paragraphs, asking the questions at the bottom of the page and looking up all the Scriptures, w’hether they have been quoted in the booklet or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) In closing have a competent publisher demonstrate how this sermon can be given effectively on a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font11">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: New World News report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Demonstration on “Increased Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This demonstration should be handled by the Bible study servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) Bible study servant will give an analysis of number conducting studies in the congregation and show how more publishers are capable and should be active in this service in obedience to Jesus’ words: “Feed my little sheep.”—John 21: 15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (5 min.) Congregation servant and Bible study servant are considering Publisher’s Record cards to determine how more publishers can be helped to share in back-call and Bible study service. The congregation servant removes from the file a card of a servant not conducting a study, and suggests that the Bible study servant check with him to see if he cannot be helped. Next, two different publisher’s cards reveal good all-round activity for the publishers, but neither one conducts a Bible study. Why? Both appear capable. Bible study servant will discuss the matter privately with each one and try to help them. Another card reveals publisher who used to conduct study regularly, but has not done so for some time. The congregation servant suggests that he also be talked to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (4 min.) The discussion with the servant and study conductor reveals that he does make back-calls with other publishers, but has no Bible study of his own. The Bible study servant points out the importance of all servants and study conductors having a home Bible study, and shows that it is an essential part of their ministry that they be teachers. (1 Tim. 3: 2) By holding a study he will also be setting a good example for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE III (4 min.) The Bible study servant privately approaches publisher who makes good placements, but conducts no studies. Their discussion reveals that the publisher is not engaging in the ministry with a purpose. Purpose of the ministry is stated. (John 15: 8, 16; Matt. 13: 23) The publisher regularly supports Sunday morning service, but cannot support back-call night for a legitimate reason. Bible study servant suggests engaging in back-call and Bible study service following Sunday morning house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE IV (4 min.) The next publisher also has good placements, but no back-calls or Bible studies. Why not? This publisher does not feel capable of making return calls and keeps no record. The Bible study servant kindly gives encouragement and helps publisher to appreciate he is capable of engaging in Bible study service. The servant counsels publisher to make notation of placements on record and in two weeks he will work with publisher in making return calls and start a study for the publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE V (4 min.) The next publisher used to conduct studies, but has not done so for a Icmg time now. Discussion reveals that the publisher has gotten into a rut, has shied away from the responsibility. Servant kindly and tactfully uses appropriate scriptures and reasons with the publisher in encouraging him to start using his good abilities to become a teacher once again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(2 min.) Summary by Bible study servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on “Better and More Back-Calls and Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Matt. 10: 8] at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font11">Magazine Day experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk on “Love Builds Up,” using “Yearbook” experiences and article on “Your Vacation in 1958.” One thing we must never lose sight of in our ministry is the importance of love, even as Paul shows at 1 Corinthians 13: 1-13. No wonder “love builds up”! —1 Cor. 8: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We can show love to our brothers at assemblies, as noted by an outsider at a Singapore assembly and by a brother in Argentina (258, 77). By a friendly attitude toward those to whom we witness we show love that the people appreciate, as one sister in Liberia and a brother in El Salvador found (202, 139). Love is patient and patience gets results, as one special pioneer in Tangier reported (74). Our brothers in Southern Rhodesia have a unique and effective way of showing love, which might be tried elsewhere (267)'! We can show love by hospitality, as do the brothers in Berlin to those who come from the Eastern Zone (90). And showing love marks us to those on the outside, even as Jesus said it would at John 13: 34, 35 (263, 221).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, on Life, page 248, Some Living May Never Die to the end of the section on page 249. To be handled by questions and answers, audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: Talk on “Parents, Do You </span><span class="font11">Love Your Children?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those congregations having a fifth meeting should arrange their own program locally.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> We should appreciate the helpful Bible truth: “There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk, but in the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment.” —Prov. 15: 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Accomplishment in Kingdom service is what the theocratic organization wants. This means consultation on the part of the servants in each congregation.

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Parents, Do You Love Your Children?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Today some of us are neglecting to give our children even a rudimentary understanding of the basic truths of God’s Word. This situation is noted not only by many congregation overseers and circuit servants but is also apparent when young brothers come to Bethel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Is the snare of materialism depriving your children of a sound theocratic education, or is it the love of pleasure, on your part and theirs? Or are you so busy hunting and feeding the other sheep that you are neglecting the prospective other sheep in your own family?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For some time now the Society has felt that it would be well for all parents to conduct a regular home Bible study with their own children. If the children are not dedicated one parent may report it as a regular home Bible study and count the time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Nor is that all. Theocratic upbringing includes having them regularly accompany you to the various meetings, and you parents are the logical ones to be training your children in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Let it be said of your child even as it was to Eunice’s: “From infancy you have known the holy writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith.” —2 Tim. 3: 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WE WANT ALL TO KNOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Society wishes all in the congregations to know how much it appreciates the contributions that are being made to the Society for aiding brothers overseas to attend the 1958 international assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Read Acknowledgment Letters</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> With so many things to be read at the meetings we find that some congregation servants take on themselves the responsibility of not reading the Society’s communications. An appropriate time to read letters acknow-ledging donations would be when the accounts servant'makes his monthly report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We ask that congregation servants see to it that the letters the Society writes to the congregations are read, not withheld.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTMAS MAGAZINE DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregations will want to keep in mind that Christmas will be a special Magazine Day. Two order blanks are enclosed with this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> so that sufficient copies of the December 22 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.!</span><span class="font12"> and the January 1 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> may be ordered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential Qualities of Sermons Part 3—Striking Introductions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Having previously considered the need of a theme for our sermons and of an approach that is positive and upbuilding, let us now note the value of a striking introduction. Among the definitions that Webster’s dictionary gives for “striking” are: “Attracting attention through conspicuous qualities; surprising.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> So a striking Introduction is one that at once gains the attention of the householder. As a rule our knock at the door interrupts him, and so he is anxious to get rid of us so that he can get back to what he had been doing as soon as possible, which to him seems far more interesting or important than anything we may have to say. But if our introduction is striking enough it will make him forget all about what he had been doing or the objection he intended to voice and instead he will give us his undivided attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> God’s servants in times past made use of striking statements to arouse attention, as when Solomon said: “The day of death [is better] than the day of one’s being born.” In fact, Jesus was fond of making striking statements: “Break down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.” And among the stinking titles used in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine last year was, “Can You Read Two Thousand</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Better and More Back-Calls </span><span class="font12">(Coni’r?) back-call work. Then what? On Sunday, following the house-to-house work, make the best use of the back-call service. Many of the sisters also find splendid opportunities for making back-calls during midweek activity. More publishers making time for back-calls—that is the big step toward more back-calls. “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.”—Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In the next verse (17) the apostle says: “Go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” As we work toward our goal, never forget this: It is God’s will that all kinds of people</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Words a Minute?”—Eccl. 7:1; John .2:19; 6: 53.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Our very first words to the householder may be of a striking nature. Generally, however, it would seem best to first give the greetings of the day, make some comment regarding the weather, if it is noteworthy, or some other down-to-earth remark that will put the householder in a relaxed frame of mind. A striking introduction many have used Is, “Would you like to live forever on a paradise earth?” Or, “Did you know that there will be hundreds of thousands of persons that will never die? Yes, the Bible shows ...” Or we could make some striking observation regarding the crime situation based on recently released statistics: “Did you know that last year a major crime was committed every twelve seconds for a total of 2j million in the United States?” Or we could make a surprising remark about the danger of radiation or to some sensationally headlined news item such as a major disaster or a local crime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> A striking introduction is like a sharp, two-edged sword. Unless we wield it skillfully we may cut ourselves. The most effective striking introductions are those that especially suit the personality of the one using them, the person to which they are addressed and the circumstances. A child can make a certain striking statement that an adult could not, and vice versa.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tell the Good News from Day to Day —Ps. 96:2</span></p><img src="km_E_195711_files/km_E_195711-3.png" alt="" style="width:139pt;height:74pt;">
<p><span class="font12">“come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” Knowing this, we will keenly desire to start Bible studies. Bible study servants will want to take the initiative; and, together with all other servants, have a home Bible study and help others to share in this service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW WORLD NEWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Haitian brothers express heartfelt thanks for 3,000 pounds of clothing sent from the United States to help them in this time of need. August closed with 417 publishers—a new peak and a 55-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Japan has first five-day assembly, with 568 at public talk and 45 immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">News from South Africa tells of 11,247 Bible studies, their ninth peak in this feature of the work during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">+ The Philippine branch tells of over 1,000 pioneers reporting for the fifth month this service year, including 405 vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Despite continued restrictions in the Belgian Congo the brothers reported not less than the 20-percent quota every month except one. The past three months have shown a 100-percent increase over last year’s average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland reports over 14,000 publishers for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20,745 enjoy four district assemblies in Southern Rhodesia. Only 158 baptized, as candidates were carefully checked for proper marital status and understanding of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">* Five countries in South and Central America close the service year with new peaks: Argentina, 4,700; Boliva, 223; Brazil, 11,602; British Honduras, 176; and El Salvador, 426.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">+ Bahamas exceeded the 20-percent goal of publishers for fifth successive month, reporting 145 in service in August. + Cameroun reached a new peak of 3,067 in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">▲ Newfoundland brothers enjoy assembly at Corner Brook. There were 16 baptized, and 511 attended the public talk, showing good results from the service of 345 -brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">servants and their wives will have a goal of their own : Each week they will strive to start at least two new Bible studies and turn them over to publishers in the local congregation to care for after they leave. Care for these well. As in the case of all studies, go prepared, having the lesson well in mind., Make them better studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Do you realize what better and more Bible studies mean? Just think! With only one third of the publishers conducting them last year we averaged 135,022 studies each month and 17,927 more publishers! What would the increase be with two thirds of the publishers conducting studies? Let us work to find out, thereby carrying out Jehovah’s will.</span></p></li></ul>

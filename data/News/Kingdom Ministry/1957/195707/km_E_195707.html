<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up with Back-Calls and Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we say, “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do,” do we mean it? Are we willing to do all that He commands? The Israelites did not keep this promise, and certainly we do not want to follow their steps. But yet we do, if we do not complete our ministry. That is what happens when we call from house to house and fail to make proper notation of the interest found and then call back on it.—Ex. 19: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Obeying the command to feed the Lord’s sheep is not done merely by making an initial call and leaving literature. That is just the beginning of our ministry. We must follow through. But before calling back it is necessary to prepare our presentation. What will be our opening words? How will we get into the back-call sermon? What theme and scriptures will we use? How will we step from the sermon into a study? These are questions that must be answered before we go out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Since only two thirds of this country’s publishers do back-call work, and many of these not regularly, it is evident that we have a sizable number of ministers whose ministry is incomplete. Here is a weakness that needs to be worked on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There is no shortage of calls. Every placement is a potential back-call. And do not forget all the subscriptions taken during the campaign. The persons who subscribed also must be called on. The subscribers can be encouraged to read the magazines by having interesting points drawn to their attention. In case a study can be started it would be well to have a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True'’</span><span class="font11"> with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The summer is the time to cover territory that is infrequently worked in the winter. Find the interested persons in such territories and strive to develop their interest while the weather permits. Put into practice what you have learned about making effective back-calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> There is a joy in the. back-call and Bible study work that more than compensates for any discouragements a person may have in the regular house-to-house work. Here are people who have manifested interest. They will listen to you, and you can remove the stumbling stones they may have. When a call develops into a study you will have the pleasure of seeing interested faces light up as understanding of some scripture or doctrinal point comes to them. You can watch them grow from spiritual babyhood to spiritual maturity and</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Extend Your Ministry into Unassigned Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When the apostle Paul had a vision of a man saying: “Step over into Macedonia and help us,” he promptly extended his ministry into that area. (Acts 16: 9, 10) A similar call Is now coming from persons of good will in unassigned territories.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It would be wise to offer in these territories the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions with six booklets for a two-dollar contribution. This will keep the people in constant touch with the theocratic organization. If the two subscriptions are ; ;</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">'i Any bound book, 50c. In unassigned । territory, year subscriptions for “The “ ' Watchtower” and “Awake!” and six '&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booklets, $2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">J Help Others to Oneness Under Their ' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creator.—1 Corinthians 1:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">not wanted, offer one with three booklets. If this also is turned down, drop to the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The Jehovah sermon would be fine for these people, since they were not privileged to hear it during the subscription campaign. It is a fine have the joy of knowing that you were instrumental in that growth. When they have become an active part of the New World society, you will have completed your ministry toward them in the fullest sense.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is the publisher who is balanced in the ministry that experiences such joys. They can be yours if you round out your ministry with back-call and Bible study work. Then you will be doing what Jehovah has spoken through his servant Paul: “You, though, keep your balance in all things, suffer evil, do missionary work, thoroughly accomplish your ministry.”—2 Tim. 4: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">invitation to worship Jehovah and glorify his name.—Ps. 86: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The names of interested persons and current subscribers sent to you should be called on. Try to study with them and encourage them. Invite them to attend the public talks arranged for these territories while you are there. It would also be good to show the Society’s films.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As you work the territory make a careful note of the names and addresses of new interest. Capable publishers appointed by the congregation servant can write to them during the winter months. It might even be possible to conduct a Bible study by mail.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If you have information about brothers who are not on the isolated publisher list, the Society would appreciate having that information. Send the correct name and address of each along with what you know about their background in the truth. When the unassigned territory assignment expires the congregation servant will send the Society a complete report of the activity done there, along<sup>-</sup> with the names and addresses of interested persons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Help Others to Oneness Under Their Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Help Others to Oneness Under Their Creator.’’ (See “Watchtower,” 4/15/57 and 4/1/56.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Complete Your Ministry.” Congregations having unassigned territory will also consider “Extend Your Ministry into Unasslgned Territory.” A short talk on proper coverage of territory can substitute for this in congregations without unassigned territory assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration on “Make Good Use of Tracts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Brief remarks on value of tracts; various subjects; should be carried with us at all times. In this country some eight million have been distributed annually since 1953, an average of just a little more than one a week per publisher, including pioneers! Can make more use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (2 min.) Minister’s sermon is interrupted; magazines refused. Householder storms she is a Catholic; reads no other literature; Jehovah’s witnesses are Communists, etc. Minister remembers Proverbs 15: 1 and offers the tracts “What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?” and “Jehovah’s Witnesses, Communists or Christians?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) A practical application of James 3: 17, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (2 min.) Very busy housewife comes to door with hands dripping wet or covered with grime or flour; doesn’t have time to listen or even take magazines. Minister recognizes situation, briefly alludes to Ecclesiastes 3: 7, offers tract “How Valuable Is the Bible?” comments fittingly on it and says he will call again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Comment on value of so handling situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE III (3 min.) Minister concludes last text of sermon and then offers literature. Householder definitely refuses, objects to witnesses because they do not believe in hell, will be sure to go there, etc. Minister asks if householder knows reasons and tactfully refers to Proverbs 18: 13; offers tract on Hell and urges householder look up all texts in own Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Stress value of tract in handling such a situation and show that tracts on the Trinity and Evolution can similarly be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE IV (2 min.) Minister in a bus sits alongside a stranger. Starts conversation by commenting on world conditions as seen from newspaper headlines and poses questions. Tells that these conditions are cause for optimism, as they portend better conditions in near future according to the Bible. Offers “Life in a New World,” “Sign of Christ’s Presence” or “Man’s Only Hope for Peace” tract, which stranger accepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Comment on practical application of Ephesians 5: 15, 16 with aid of tract. Note other ways tracts can be used: when anyone not in truth calls at one's home; for comforting bereaved ones by enclosing “Hope for the Dead” tract when writing letter; at funerals conducted by us to strangers present; at public talks instead of booklets, etc. Encourage all to be tract-conscious; a grand witness can be given by their good use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on “New World News.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Talk on “Yearbook” experiences, stressing assembly attendance. July the district assemblies begin. Attend at least one of them! To spur us to attend, consider some assembly items in our 1957 “Yearbook.” Suppose you had to wait seven years, or actually eighteen years, for an assembly? (76, 188) Would you neglect it then? Why show less appreciation because we have to wait only one year? And to get to an assembly, would you travel eight days on an open deck of a ship? (177) Or travel two days on horseback and then two days by bus? (239) Or walk eight days? (209) So let nothing keep us from attending at least one assembly! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Plan Now for Assembly-City Witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'18 min: Talk on “Why One Must Be Baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on text (Heb. 10: 25) at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material on Law, from top of page 240, “Other Features of Law Covenant . . to end of subject on page 242.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Let Children Praise Jehovah” based on “Yearbook” experiences. You children can have many privileges to witness. Two boys not only placed many magazines but even won the approbation of the worldly father of one of them. (62) Even an eight-year-old girl can give a fearless and effective witness to a priest, to her schoolteacher and to a stranger. (273) A nine-year-old son of a circuit servant imitated his father in encouraging-others to witness. (266) A ten-year-old Brazilian girl places booklet, has a mature publisher aid her make the back-call. Result: the entire family now are publishers. (95) For a similar instance see page 88. A twelve-year-old girl in Poland gives such a good witness that listeners shed tears of joy. She also has a goodly number of studies. (243) Many more examples could be given from the “Yearbook” but these show what children who are alert can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">23 min: Demonstration on “Training Children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Emphasizes need for parental training of children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (10 min.) Servant at service center in discussion with parent. Remarks that it is good to observe little Earnest participating in meetings, giving comments in own words. Notes, too, he does quite well with ministry school assignments—an indication of good preparation, revealing proper parental coaching and oversight. Parent, bubbling with satisfaction, appreciates hearing such kind remarks. He is interested in doing best he can for Earnest. Servant then makes observation. Earnest’s field activity is excellent some months, others very low, at times no report. Spasmodic ministry reveals need for proper training. Does parent devote as much time and effort aiding him with field service as with other privileges? Parent thinks Earnest too young to be regular in service. Feels it inadvisable to require too much of him; does not want to discourage him. Servant understandingly offers suggestions given in “The Watchtower” (1/15/54, pp. 60-62, II 23-27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (2 min.) Soliloquy: Parent muses over different points. Much good in what servant said. Terrible times, much delinquency, best to do everything possible to help children serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE III (8 min.) Series of pantomime scenes showing parent training Earnest. Parent demonstrates ease of presenting “Awake!” and “TheWatch-tower,” using simple 30- to 60-second presentations. Parent takes Earnest with him in house-to-house work, trains him to use Bible and share In sermons. At study parent encourages Earnest to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Time to start: right now! Parents protect and safeguard child’s spiritual well-being. Teach him proper ways of worship. Prepare him for the ministry, building a sound foundation through effective ministerial training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 mln: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the expression (Matt. 21: 15) at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Keeping Presentable Kingdom Halls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Demonstration on material in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Arrange locally. Congregations that attended assemblies during this month may wish to use this time for “Kingdom Ministry” material that was missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those congregations that have a fifth meeting should arrange their own program locally.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping Presentable Kingdom Halls</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom Hall should bring honor to Jehovah’s organization. This means keeping Kingdom Halls presentable. We all want to attend Kingdom Halls that are clean and attractive. Circuit servants report that some congregations need to pay more attention to this matter. The minister of God, says Paul, must be “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of.” Never’ are we ashamed to bring good-will persons to the hall because of the truth; may we never be ashamed to bring them because of its appearance.—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Responsibility for keeping Kingdom Halls presentable rests upon the congregation servant. All the brothers will be glad to co-operate with him. We all enjoy a neat and clean Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Each week some work may have to be done to keep the Kingdom Hall presentable. The congregation servant may find it practical to appoint service center groups to the privilege. Taking turns, each service group will care for the hall for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">specific period of time. Depending upon the circumstances, it may be for a month or for a week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Those assigned to care for the hall should not be left on their own. The congregation servant should out</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">The Society’s offices, factory and Bethel home in Brooklyn, New York, will be closed from August 3 to 18 inclusive. Orders and correspondence sent in during that period will be handled some time after the reopening of the offices. Please anticipate your needs and place your orders in ample time for attention before the vacation period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorandum Concerning Reserve Status</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The government has made provision for the discharge from the Reserves of persons who, since their release from active duty, have become full-time ministers. For memorandum concerning discharge procedure write to Hayden C. Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York. Request the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum Concerning Reserve Status</span><span class="font11"> and send a self-addressed stamped envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Counsel on Ministerial Claims</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All brothers concerned with the draft should request this new memorandum just prepared by Hayden C. Covington, which replaces and line the things to be done. No time will then be wasted, and the proper things will be given attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Signs become part of our Kingdom Hall. So they should be presentable. There is one sign that is usually not given enough attention. This is one that tells the time when meetings are held. Does your Kingdom Hall have such a sign? It should. Otherwise how will some good-will persons know when meetings are held? Let us not cause them or any visiting out-of-town brothers to wasfe time finding out when meetings are held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">s'Every Kingdom Hall, then, should have a sign telling when each meeting is held. It may be on the door or in a window. When Kingdom Halls are not on the main floor, it would be well to put up a notice of some kind in the window or at the entrance giving the time of meetings. Only infrequently do hours, for meetings change. Correct the signs when they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The time-of-meeting sign, as with all signs, should be neat, nicely designed and pleasing to the eye. If outside, it should be made weatherproof. Keep everything about the hall presentable. “In no way,” declared the apostle, “are we giving any cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with.”—2 Cor. 6: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">amends </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Memorandum to Jehovah’s Witnesses Concerned with the Draft. </span><span class="font11">To obtain this send a stamped selfaddressed envelope to him requesting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel</span><span class="font11"> memorandum.

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Why One Must Be Baptized</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> No one can become a part of the Christian congregation without first being baptized. Why? Because after making a solemn decision before God in one’s own mind and heart, it is divinely required of that one to be baptized. “For in that way,” said Jesus, “it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.”—Matt. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When one makes an unconditional dedication to Jehovah he becomes an alien to this old world. Therefore dedication is like taking out citizenship In the new world, and the formal ceremony of baptism is in effect an oath before witnesses confirming this fact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Jesus showed approval of water baptism, not only by his own act in submitting himself to be baptized, but also by specific commandment. “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations,” he said, “baptizing them.”-—Matt. 28 : 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Why, then, do so many delay being baptized? Our records show about seventy-five percent or three fourths of all publishers have dedicated themselves and symbolized their dedication. This, however, leaves many thousands who have not taken this all-important step of dedication. Surely you want to serve Jehovah and become part of his organization, don’t you? Then be baptized if you have made a dedication to serve Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Increased privileges of service, such as pioneering, giving instruction talks in the ministry school, discourses to the congregation and public talks, servant privileges, etc., are opened to the baptized Christian only. So do not deprive yourself of increased opportunities to serve Jehovah and your brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> At the district assemblies arrangements will be made for baptism. Take advantage of this provision. Show your appreciation for the theocratic organization as did the Ethiopian eunuch who, after receiving a brief witness by Philip, said: “Look I a body of water; what prevents me from getting baptized?” Follow his example to Jehovah’s praise and for your own spiritual welfare and good.—Acts 8: 36.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Extra Copies of September 15 “Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The public talk, “Healing of the Nations Has Drawn Near,” will be in the September 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font11">Congregations wanting to give it special distribution should order extra copies before August 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To Persons Who Say: “Someone Was Recently Here”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Preaching of the good news will go on “until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man.” (Isa. 6:11) That day when there will be no goatish persons left to confront us draws nearer. But first more sheep must be found. The more often we cover our territory the more likely the sheep will be found. With frequent territory coverage comes the objection, “But someone was recently here.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> This objection is usually the evasive kind. It is used whether we called on a person a month ago or six months ago. As we learned in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font11"> the best way to handle this kind of objection is to acknowledge it briefly and go right on with our powerful Scriptural theme.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mental Attitude</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Before answering, though, we should determine the householder’s frame of mind. Is he seriously son’s address and that he requests no more calls. However, the next tactful publisher to get that territory should call at each house. There may have been a change in attitude or in householders.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font11">annoyed? Or does the tone of his voice indicate an evasive objection? Answer accordingly. Even if the objection is earnest and the territory was covered recently, it can usually be handled with only a brief answer. Be positive. The vital thing is this: Phrase your answer so that it turns the householder’s objection squarely around, making it become an actual reason for listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Thus when a householder says, “But someone was recently here,” you might answer: “I’m glad you mentioned that; no doubt you wonder why we call so often.” Or: “Yes, we try to call on people as often as possible because our message is so urgent.” Or: “It’s because we are trying to increase respect for and create greater interest in the Bible that we call often.” Then go into your sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Strong Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes a householder becomes violent. He demands that we stop calling on him. When this happens the individual of whom this demand is made can note down the per- |</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Really, the more often people say, “You were recently here,” the happier we can be. It shows the separating work is going on apace. Sheep are being found. Rejoice, then, and “let us not give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.”—Gal. 6:9; Heb. 12:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Assembly time is here! Are you ready? Do your plans include witnessing? “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” And witnesses we must be by witnessing en route to assemblies, during assemblies and when returning home from assemblies. In fact, witnessing is our life. Paul said we are “ambassadors substituting for Christ/’ Let us, then, carry out our assignment faithfully, with dignity and respect.—Isa. 43:10; 2 Cor. 5:20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If sightseeing, shopping, relaxing and visiting are important to you at assembly cities, then bearing witness should be much more so, because that is your commission. One reason for having assemblies is to provide a great witness to the glory of God; also that men of good will might see the happiness of the New World society and desire to become a part of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Assemblies also provide a wide range for individual witnessing. The Society, in preparing the program, allows time for morning field service. If witnessing were not vital, then talks would be arranged for this time. So include in your assembly plans a big place for field service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Witnessing is important, we know. Staying in private homes provides a much better opportunity for witnessing than does staying in hotels. On the way to assembly cities witness to gas station attendants, clerks, businessmen, waiters and waitresses, and others. Let them know Jehovah’s witnesses are on the move! Do not rely on only your lapel badge, or a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">magazine placed in the rear window of your car to do. the witnessing for you. While these do bear witness in a silent way, still we must add our warmth and enthusiasm. This comes only from heart-to-heart witnessing. Remember, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font11"> are an ambassador substituting for Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We must bear witness. That is our assignment. Plan for it now. Take with you plenty of literature to distribute along the way. And as a reminder, do not forget to mail in your service report to your home congregation before the end of July. This year, make your assembly more enjoyable by setting aside time for thankful praise to Jehovah as his witness by bearing witness.</span></p>

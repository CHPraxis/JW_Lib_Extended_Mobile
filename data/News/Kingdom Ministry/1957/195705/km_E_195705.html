<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Christians must grow up. They cannot remain spiritual babes all of their lives and still be Christians. Spiritual growth is absolutely essential to salvation. The majority of earth’s inhabitants will be destroyed at Armageddon because of their not having allowed themselves to grow up spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Paul beckons Christians to “press on to maturity,” “to the measure of growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ; in order that we should no longer be babes, tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of craftiness in contriving error. But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ.”—Heb. 6:1; Eph. 4:11-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Servants as well as mature publishers will aid the many new ones that have started out in the ministry in April to make progress in May and the following months. They will help them to “become full-grown in powers of understanding” so that they will be able to stand firm in this evil day.—1 Cor. 14: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Since many of the new ones, no doubt, have had some experience in magazine work, during May have them grow in the house-to-house ministry, teach them to handle the campaign offers, encourage them to grow up. Do not wait for May to expire before offering them a spiritual hand. They being spiritually weak, the danger of their slipping back into old worldly habits is present. So watch over the sheep.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The assistant congregation servant should give lists of the new publishers to the study conductors during the first part of May so that they can be given special attention. No one can afford to stand still. Keep on making progress in righteousness. Progress, not stopping, is the greatest counterforce against negligence and indifference. Relapsing into old bad habits will cause us to lose life. Therefore, “press on to maturity,” “grow to salvation.” —1 Pet. 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> With long evenings upon us, prestudy magazine service should be arranged so that publishers can express their devotion to Jehovah. On the way to the study publishers may work homes with the magazines. Where the May offer (consult box) is placed, if possible include the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span><span class="font11"> Then do not overlook the need of calling back and starting home Bible studies with interested persons. Aid them to attain to the oneness in the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MAY Any two books and two booklets for $1. THEME FOR MAY Use Theocratic War Strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Matthew 10: 16.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">LOOK AT OUR REPORT!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Yes, look at our March report and rejoice! Rejoice at what? Rejoice first at 191,037 publishers—a new all-time peak, well surpassing December’s 189,517. Grand indeed!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> But that is only the beginning I We also had a new all-time peak in hours, a new all-time peak in subscriptions obtained in one month during a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign, a new all-time peak in back-calls, a new all-time peak in Bible studies, a new all-time peak in public meetings, and a new all-time peak in magazine placements! Just think, 3,354,167 magazines placed in March! Almost a quarter million more than in any other month on record!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In fact, every month since December more than 180,000 publishers</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Home Bible studies have increased excellently. There were 127,211 studies conducted in December, which in January increased to 137,618 and in March to 147,150. In March a year ago there were only 106,910 studies being conducted. That means 40,240 more studies are being conducted this year than last. An excellent increase! The average is now up to .6 studies for publishers, 5.3 for pioneers and 8.2 for special pioneers. Keep up the good work! In the words of Paul: “Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty”!—1 Cor. 16:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Jesus had a great love for Jehovah and the sheep. In prayer to his Father he said: “When I was with them I used to watch over them out of respect for your own name which you have given me, and I have kept them, and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction, so that the scripture has been fulfilled.” Let us show the same love and respect, that none of the sheep He has entrusted in our care perish. Help them in love to grow to salvation.—John 17:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">have reported: December, 189,517; January 180,246; February 184,203; now March, with an outstanding 191,037!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> This growth promises even greater things for April. With the special activities surrounding the Memorial and the use of the two special magazines throughout the month, what heights will it reach?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> For the seven months of the service year that have thus far passed we have averaged 181,891, a 7.1-percent increase over last year’s average of 169,835. With five months yet to go, and with such fine increases being made, a really excellent year’s work is anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> You and your congregation are sharing in this great increase.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Use Theocratic War Strategy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Use Theocratic War Strategy.” (See “Watchtower,” 5/1/57, p. 286, and 2/1/56, p. 76.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Consider “Yearbook” experiences on Being Tactful Toward All. “A slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be tactful toward all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tact often requires an indirect approach, as used by a Belgian sister. (89) Tact may mean speaking first of fulfillment of prophecy and Kingdom blessings before taking up controversial matters. (129) Tact enabled a Nigerian brother to witness in a place from which he had been chased out (222); for a similar instance see page 279. Tact also means using a soft answer to turn away wrath, as did a publisher in the Azores. (246) Yes, we need to be tactful toward all if we would be effective Christian witnesses of Jehovah. 10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material on the Kingdom, from page 234 “Kingdom in Sovereign Power Not Established at Pentecost,” to page 235, Ps. 83: 17, 18. To be handled as a back-call,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 mln: Talk on main article, “Grow to Salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 mtn: Arrange locally. (Include discussion of “Look at Our Report!”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 20 min: Questions and answers (15 min.) on “Do You Respect Your Brother’s Home?” followed by summarization or additional Scriptural counsel by chairman (5 min.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Demonstration developing sermon given in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Talk on “Presenting the Good News” article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">PANEL DISCUSSION (12 min.) From two to four persons, depending upon the size of the congregation, work out this sermon. They offer suggestions as to introduction, connectives, the logic of the order of the texts and conclusions that lead into the various literature offers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">DEMONSTRATION (8 min.) Demonstrate use at a door of the sermon panel has worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on text at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Consider “Yearbook” experiences on starting and diligently following through on home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Watering the seed means starting and conducting home Bible studies, for it is studies that develop persons into being Jehovah’s witnesses, as the Ivory Coast report of our 1957 “Yearbook” shows. (156) Neglect may mean eight valuable years lost, as with one person in Newfoundland. (216) And let us not prejudge the interest; not all immediately appreciate the need of a study, as did a family of ten Canadians. (107) If we do prejudge we may regret it, as did a missionary in Uruguay. (282)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They may seem to take literature just to please us and yet have a good heart, as did a certain Chinese in Singapore. (258) True, it takes patience, as a witness in Tangier stressed (75); and also effort, such as riding ten miles each way by bicycle (217); but what of that if we get results, if Jehovah keeps making it grow? And remember, studies can be held almost anywhere, as the report for American Samoa shows. (80)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration on “Conducting Effective Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Open with counsel encouraging each publisher to have and conduct a home Bible study regularly. It is a means of fulfilling Jesus’ instructions to “feed my sheep.” (John 21:15-17) The goal in conducting a study is to bring the good-will person to an accurate knowledge of the truth and lead him to associate with the organization. The Bible study servant and study conductors can give publishers much help and encouragement. Bible study servant may give study conductor list of names of persons with whom publishers in his service center are conducting studies. He might emphasize to conductor that these studies are the potential increase for his area and that it would be well for him to arrange to go with the publishers sometime when they conduct the study. The purpose would be twofold: (1) To get acquainted with the good-will interest and (2), if needed, to give kind counsel to the publisher that he may be “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.” (2 Tim. 2: 15) We now see conductor going with sister on her Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (7 min.) Sister introduces study conductor to householder. After brief greetings the group sit down to study. The brother offers prayer. The sister conducts her study in the usual manner (head covering not needed by sister), following suggestion in Study 54 of “Qualified to Be Ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) After studying briefly the chairman breaks in, saying; “And so the study continues for the hour. When it is completed let’s listen to the invitation given to the good-will person to attend the congregation book study.” Conductor will follow suggestions in paragraph 5, page 216, of “Qualified to Be Ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (3 min.) After leaving good-will person’s home, study conductor commends sister on good points of conducting the study. He then points out Scriptural rule: “pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching,” and offers a few points of tactful counsel. (1 Tim. 4: 16) One point might be the looking up of scriptures not quoted so that good-will people may become acquainted with the Bible. He also encourages sister to have goodwill persons give an answer more in their own words. This can be done by asking additional leading questions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN: (2 mln.) Sum up the benefits of this arrangement that will help us “keep on speaking what things are fitting for healthful teaching.” —Titus 2: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Cover “Congregation Organization” by a talk on maturity. Show how one way of demonstrating maturity is by conducting a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material on the Kingdom, from page 235 “All Selected for Kingdom Must Die in Order to Enter It” to end of chapter. To be handled as a talk with a brief review of previous points made by way of introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration on “Following Through on Expiration Slips.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Upon receipt of these notices the congregation should see that calls are made on these former subscribers. Over 600,000 expiration slips were sent to congregations last year. Tens of thousands of these persons were happy to subscribe once again on being contacted. Publishers making such calls may count a back-call. If the person takes the subscription, count it as a new one. To be effective on these calls we must be “tactful toward all, qualified to teach.” —2 Tim. 2: 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (5 min.) Bible study servant approaches study conductor to give him some expiration slips for people in his service center territory. The Bible study servant kindly impresses upon the study conductor the need for making the calls at an early date. Calls can be made on back-call night, after Sunday morning service, etc. Study conductor asks for suggestions on an effective approach. He is told to be tactful and “qualified to teach.” Bible study servant suggests giving a warm, friendly greeting, then going into a pointed three- to eight-minute sermon, concluding with the offer of a subscription. Bible study servant points out that this method is much more effective than the blunt way of going to the door with slip in hand, telling the person that he subscribed before and that his subscription has run out and asking if he would like to subscribe again. Bible study servant invites conductor to accompany him on a call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (8 min.) At door Bible study servant makes apt introduction, <sup>!</sup> using person’s name and then leading into sermon. On completing sermon he mentions that the information he has just presented has been coming to the householder through the (“Watchtower” or “Awake!”) magazine. Publisher directs householder’s attention to points of interest in current magazine. Householder is encouraged to renew his subscription so he will not miss such interesting articles as the ones just discussed. At this point he lets householder see expiration slip for the first time, saying that he will be glad to renew the subscription so the householder will not miss any more issues. Householder subscribes. Arrangements are made for return call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE III (3 min.) Bible study servant and conductor discuss advantages of (1) avoiding delay by calling on former subscribers as soon as possible after receiving notices and (2) publishers’ giving a sermon before offering subscription. Also emphasize need for making arrangements for calling back, having in mind a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) During May and June the Society will send out many expiration slips. Be “qualified to teach” these former subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk on 1957 district assemblies. Include reading and discussing of special letter with assembly details. 10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FIFTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Arrange locally.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Maturity—Our Final Goal</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Maturity is the seventh and last of our special goals for 1957. Have you reached the other goals? Have you achieved this one? The desire for maturity is proper and right. A child wants to mature. A young adult does, too. An intelligent man of any age wants even further maturity. Certainly Christian ministers must be even more vitally concerned about spiritual maturity. Where do you stand in regard to it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> With real maturity comes a balance of appreciation and understanding, with the production of the fruitage of the spirit. It has to do with completeness of growth and development. It is the outstanding quality for an overseer, is a requirement for all publishers, and is an urgent goal toward which all must strive. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font11"> page 231, paragraph 3.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The mature man does not just preach, but he teaches, aiding others to grow as he has. This requires sound knowledge, diligent</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice to Pioneer Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pioneers registered with their draft boards who have not had their ministerial claims recognized by their boards may write to Hayden C. Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, sending a self-addressed stamped envelope, and ask for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Pate</span><span class="font11"> opinion, which can be submitted to the draft board and placed in their files along with a request for reopening.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Notice has been received from the post office advising handbills tracts and other literature are being placed in mailboxes. This is a violation of postal regulations, as mailboxes are to receive only mail delivered by the post office. Congregation servants will please bring this matter to the attention of the congregation so all understand nothing is to be placed in mailboxes at any time by publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">application and real experience in the teaching work. Have you, through study and experience, developed the maturity that gives you this qualification to teach? Do you know the truth? Can you explain doctrine? Can you teach, persuade and understand the other person’s problems and obstacles, helping him to overcome them? The true Christian must be able to do so.—1 Tim. 3:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The apostle told Timothy to teach “faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.” Do you show such results in service, adequately teaching others? All true Christians should have this qualification.—2 Tim. 2: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Obviously' this desired maturity does not depend solely upon the length of time you have been in the congregation, for many new ones show rapid growth, maturing quick-</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do You Respect Your Brother's Home?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A11 congregations need private homes for service centers. The brothers in the congregations appreciate this need and many of them are in position to open their homes for the use of a service center for their congregation. The Society certainly appreciates this.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are very grateful that they can meet together with those of like precious faith and they respect the property and treasured possessions that people have in their homes. But once in a while children and sometimes grownups get out of hand. What individuals allow their own children to do in their own home is not very often allowed to be done in someone else’s home. If the home to which you are going has a nice hedge around it, no one would allow his children to jump over the hedge or cut through it. No one would want to track in dirt, or if it was raining or snowing certainly all of the Lord’s people would want to take off their overshoes before entering the home. Politeness and respect for other people’s pi-operty is appreciated by the homeowner. When we stop to consider we realize that with many people coming into a home much dirt is tracked in, which means that the householder is going to do extra cleaning in the rooms that are used, and, too, they always have to rearrange their furniture according to the number who attend, so that the room can be put to good use. It shows thankfulness on the part of those who put the furniture back.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font11">ly. How can you do so? By making the same application in study and service that they have done.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> This maturity is an aid to salvation. It is the fulfillment of a Scriptural requirement. Not only must we mature, but we must be willing to aid others to do so. We must follow Paul’s example. He said: “I continue praying, that your love may abound yet more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment, that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not be stumbling others up to the day of Christ.” —Phil, 1:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The need for growth in maturity is great. Mature publishers, servants and pioneers are always needed in the Christian organization. It must be full of such mature Christians. Have you grown to such maturity? You can do so. No course that you could take would be more important. Will you take it? The answer, which might mean your life, is up to you.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> These homes where congregational book studies are held should at the moment of. their use be considered just like a Kingdom Hall, and since we never serve refreshments at Kingdom Halls after meetings, so people would hardly expect this to be done at private homes. The homeowners should not feel obligated to do so. If the study conductor had handled the meeting properly, everyone would be well fed spiritually, and those who are attending certainly do not want ‘to impose an expensive burden upon any one of you’ who have volunteered your homes. —2 Thess. 3 : 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There is no need to linger long after the meeting is over. It may be that the family in whose home the study is held has children that they want to put to bed, or they may have to help them with their studies. So Jehovah’s witnesses would not want to wear out their hosts by prolonged presence. It is always good to have in mind what the wise man said, ‘Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, lest he become weary of you.’ (Prov. 25:17) Maybe they had these problems back there in the days of the apostles. Many meetings were held in homes then, and it is recorded in Phjjippians 2: 4 that the householder has personal interests just like the rest of us and that is why it is stated: “Keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”</span></p></li></ul>

The homeowner should always be consulted as to how often during the week his home can be used as a service center.

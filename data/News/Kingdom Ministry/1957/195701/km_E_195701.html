I am come ... to do your will, O God.” Are you like Peter and Andrew? When Jesus said to them : “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men,” at once they abandoned their nets and followed him.—Isa. 6:8; Heb. 10:7; Matt. 4:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Have you abandoned your nets? Hundreds of thousands have. They see the work that is to be done, and they do it. The hunting and fishing for men is their first concern. Is it yours? Do you really search out of “every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks” those who will hear the message of life? Where are they? Some are right in your territory!—Jer. 16:16.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Kingdom ministers, like Paul, desire to “preach the word of God thoroughly.” To do this we need to carry our own load of responsibility. God’s Word tells us: “Each one will carry his own load of responsibility.” So to thoroughly accomplish our Kingdom ministry we must be willing to bear two key responsibilities: (1) Prepare yourself for effective witnessing before going out in the field ministry. (2) Be willing to work alone.—Gal. 6: 5, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First, we need adequate preparation. Those who lack preparation are</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">selves and not as joyfully happy in Kingdom service as they could be. So know what literature is required. Make certain you have a sufficient supply. Know when and where to meet for Kingdom service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Most important is the responsibility to know our doorstep sermons. congregation publishers 2. Meet the quota by spending at least two hours each Sunday in door-to-door work, then one or more hours in back-call and Bible study activity, as Jehovah’s visible organization has suggested.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Take the lead in this zealous campaign. Aid new ones who started in December to continue. Set them a good example as fishers of men. Encourage them to abandon their “nets” and to give Jehovah exclusive devotion through following Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Kingdom ministers should have several of them. Before going from house to house, a few minutes should be spent in reviewing the ones to be used. Even if you have already used a particular sermon, refresh your knowledge of it. Practice it. For fluency and confidence public speakers review their hour lectures, though they may have delivered them before. So should the Kingdom minister with his doorstep sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Are you carrying your responsibility to prepare beforehand? If not, what is the reason? Examine yourself: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” Is there laziness or negligence? Is there complacency because of being conversant in the truth, with a resultant attempt to try to speak whatever comes to one’s mind at the door? Such random witnessing is not conducive to efficiency. A more effective, thorough witness can be given by using a sermon with a well-developed theme.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The second key responsibility: Be willing to work alone. Some publishers are often found working in pairs though they are well-grounded in the truth. Why? It may be a misunderstanding; they may feel that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col.</span><span class="font10"> I)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Give Jehovah Exclusive Devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min; </span><span class="font9">Talk on “Give Jehovah Exclusive Devotion.” (See “Watchtower,” 1/1/57, p. 30, and 1/1/56, p. 8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">23 min; Develop and demonstrate a model sermon for the “Watchtower” campaign. A competent brother, possibly the school servant, should be selected as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Kingdom ministers need to “be ready for every good work.” (Titus 3: 1) Are we ready for “Watchtower” campaign? Now is the time to prepare an effective sermon. “Watchtower” a vital instrument to aid persons of good will to give Jehovah exclusive devotion. An apt theme, then, is “Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (13 min.) Chairman will have the following outline of the sermon based on God’s name placed before audience, using a blackboard or some other means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">People pray,“Hallowed be thy name,” but Just what is God's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God indefinite term; our Lord has personal name—Father has too</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—1 Cor. 8: 5, 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah is God’s name —Ps. 83: 18 or Ex. 6: 2, 3 We pray for his kingdom and blessings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rev. 21: 3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Must know and do Jehovah’s will to live under Kingdom—Matt. 7: 20, 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman will call on the audience to develop points of the outline. He will draw out good points on all features of the sermon and be prepared to contribute ideas himself. Special attention should be given to the transition from sermon to offer. For example, one might say: “This magazine, ‘The Watchtower,’ is exclusively devoted to announcing Jehovah’s kingdom, to learning about Jehovah’s kingdom and what we are to do to serve him in an acceptable way. Note here on page — it informs us . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The chairman’s objective should be to draw forth from the audience a wealth of ideas on ways this sermon might be developed. Kingdom ministers may then select the ideas that appeal to them the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DEMONSTRATION (5 min.) The chairman will have a publisher, selected beforehand, demonstrate one effective way of presenting the “Jehovah” sermon. The model sermon should be well prepared. Should the householder not take subscription, minister may demonstrate dropping down to the “Survival” booklet and a sample copy of “The Watchtower” for 15 cents or a “Watchtower” and “Awake!” for 10 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Chairman stresses importance of not dropping down to booklet and single-copy magazine offer until reasonable efforts have been put forth to obtain subscription. Our diligence in preparing sermon will show our desire to give Jehovah exclusive devotion and to help others do the same, thereby avoiding the penalty of everlasting destruction for not knowing Jehovah.—2 Thess. 1: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Discourse on article entitled “Giving Jehovah Exclusive Devotion.” 10 min: Arrange locally. (Read pioneer letter sent with this “Kingdom Ministry.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Cover by questions and answers Judgment Days in “Make Sure of All' Things,” from Family or Community Condemnation, p. 223, to Psalm 72: 4, 7, 8, on p. 224.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Talk on “1958 International Convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min; By a demonstration cover “Presenting the Good News: To the Indifferent or Self-satisfied.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk based on the pioneer letter read last week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk from “Yearbook” material on “The Watchtower.” That it is a vital preaching instrument our new “Yearbook” clearly shows. In Denmark two instances show where subscriptions led to studies, dedication and baptism. (129) The first copy a Finnish subscriber received prepared him for a home study and theocratic progress. (143) Also in Finland a 74-jfear-old pioneer obtained 35 subscriptions by telephone. (144) Where you cannot get subscriptions leave single copies and call back. A single copy led to a Thailand Buddhist woman’s having two studies a week, each two hours long, and now she publishes. (276)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization: The Training Program.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: A demonstration to follow through on what was learned the previous week regarding developing and using the “Jehovah” sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Those in training program, the more mature ones, are to “support the weak,” the newer ones. (1 Thess. 5: 14) Mature ones do this by helping new ones develop and use a sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (4 min.) The congregation servant is discussing the progress of the less mature with a more mature publisher. Congregation servant inquires about results mature publisher is having with sermon. Brother “More Mature” responds, telling how much he enjoys giving sermon and the grand results he is having. Question comes up as to whether mature publisher has aided his training program companion to use sermon. Mature one has not aided him to develop and use sermon. He is counseled to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (10 min.) Brother “More Mature” and “Less Mature” are going over the sermon together. Brother “More Mature” refreshes the mind of “Less Mature” regarding the points developed at the congregation discussion of the sermon, including ideas on the opening and close at the door. In conclusion they arrange to meet for Kingdom service Sunday morning. Brother “Less Mature” promises to come prepared to use the sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (7 min.) The two are Working together in field service. Brother “More Mature” has taken a few doors and now it is “Less Mature’s” turn. He goes to a door and successfully gives the “Jehovah” sermon. In conclusion Brother “More Mature” offers appropriate counsel and gives encouragement. Thereafter each publisher continues in door-to-door ministry, but instead of working together they decide to work separately so as to accomplish more in Kingdom ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Mature publishers should be willing and anxious to carry out responsibility to “support the weak.” Less mature publishers should be willing and anxious to learn and improve their Kingdom ministry and thus help make “Watchtower” campaign best yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Suggestion: Consider the slogan on the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Demonstration back-call based on material in “Make Sure of All Things,” under Judgment Days. Take from subheading 1,000-Year Day of Test Comes After Armageddon, p. 224, to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6 min: Talk on “Prepare for Public Meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: A group of publishers are at a home for a social evening and they start discussing some “Yearbook” material on giving Jehovah exclusive devotion. Page 98 shows how completely a man in British Honduras freed himself from the snare of materialism. We can also give exclusive devotion by serving where the need is great, as some in Australia have done by moving to Pacific Islands where no witnesses are to be found. (79) That giving exclusive devotion also means being cautious as serpents is highlighted in the Berlin report, where 1,300 are still in prison. (90, 91) Giving Jehovah exclusive devotion in spite of strong opposition caused Greece to have a seven percent increase this year (157), and caused a reported quadrupling of ministers in Poland in the six years of the ban. (242) For other striking reports the publisher group can bring out see comments on Mexico (209) and Libya (181).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk on “Carry Your Own Load of Responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Suggestion: Consider the slogan at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Training Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> This is another Kingdom ministry goal. Training brothers to become efficient in the ministry is an obligation laid upon all Christians. Christ Jesus set the example and we are instructed “to follow his steps closely.” Giving of ourselves in this way brings happiness. Paul said: “You must assist those who. are weak and must bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’ ”—1 Pet. 2: 21; Acts 20: 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The training program is designed to assist weaker<sup>-</sup> publishers to become regular and more effective in all activities of the ministry. Therefore, let those assigned to work with weaker ones consider their assignments seriously as to Jehovah. Begin working together in a systematic way. Start with a schedule. Adjust your personal affairs so that you have definite times to work together, not only every Sunday, but also during the week in back-call, Bible study and magazine work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Together prepare your three- to eight-minute sermons. Make your talks down-to-earth. Let your companion hear you give it at the door. Try to make your presentation simple, direct, tactful; easy enough for your companion to copy. Avoid long, drawn-out, polished sermons. They tend to discourage, leaving him to feel that he can never match your eloquence or presentation.—1 Cor. 2:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Work with your companion about half an hour, giving him counsel and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Ten Commandments”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregation servants should immediately arrange to submit to all the newspapers in their territory copies of the November 8,1956, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> and the January 15,1957, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> The articles written as reviews of the Hollywood production “The Ten Commandments” should be specially marked. These magazines should be delivered in person wherever possible and an effort should be made to identify the one on the newspaper’s staff who writes movie reviews. If unable to contact this one in person, then a covering letter should accompany the magazines. The congregation servant should identify himself and his position as presiding minister of the local congregation. Grant permission to quote from the articles as long as credit is given to the magazine. Any response in the press should be forwarded to the public relations desk.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">advice. Then let him work alone applying the instruction, while you take the other side of the street. About an hour later return. See how he is progressing by going along with him to a few more doors. Commend him on good points. Show him where he can improve, but never counsel him in the sight or hearing of the person witnessed to. Wait till you are alone. Do this in a kind, casual mannei<sup>-</sup> when going to the next door. Always think and talk encouragingly. Badiate enthusiasm and joy in the work. “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit.” Your companion will pick up your happy spirit and reflect it. Enliven in him a desire to be a right kind of minister.—Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Work with him this way week after week, for a whole year if necessary. When he has developed into an excellent publisher, then possibly he can be used to help others in the training program. Remember, however, the training program does not replace the need for aiding all irregular publishers. It is something added to aid publishers assigned to become mature ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> When assigning brothers use discretion. Brothers whose personalities might tend to clash should not be made to work together. It is not only discouraging but oftentimes causes them to shun contact points and ignore field service altogether. Congregation servants should keep close watch and make adjustments when necessary. The circuit servant will also make adjustments, when necessary, on his visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1957 District Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As soon as contract arrangements for the 1957 district assemblies are made, they will be announced. So plans can be made for this year’s “feast of fat things.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>1958 International Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">All God-loving Christians are thrilled by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> announcement of an international convention to be held in New York in 1958. Now is the time for initial planning of personal affairs such as vacations, finances, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rooming accommodations are another earlier concern. However, the rooming or convention office will not be in operation until March or April of 1958. Your congregation will receive room request forms in ample time prior to the assembly. Then will be the proper time to fill in the type of accommodations needed for your requirements. This includes hotels. The Society is beginning now to make arrangements with the hotels to hold their rooms for our convention. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">It will be to everyone's advantage to write to the convention as mentioned rather than directly to the hotels.</span><span class="font10"> You can in this way cooperate with the Society and your brothers that will be attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All Kingdom publishers look forward to the public talks given by the circuit and district servants. Starting March 2, the new talk to be given by the circuit servant will be: “Are We Masters of Our Own Future?” Beginning in March, the district servant’s subject will be: “Removing the Barriers Dividing Mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Busy but Appreciative</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Often while engaged in the ministry we hear people say they are busy. Sometimes this is used as an excuse to turn away the Kingdom publisher, while at other times people are truly busy. This means a minister must be discerning. When people are really busy, make a notation on your house-to-house record and call again. Just because a person says he is busy does not necessarily mean he is not interested, as the following letter received by the Society well shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Dear Friends:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This morning two very nice young men came to my door. I was busy with an important call and so dismissed them as hurriedly as possible. I am sorry to have seemed rude, as I have great respect for the work you are doing and I realize that it is not easy to go from door to door as you do. I am sure you do much good and thank you for your patience.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be ministers</span><span class="font10"> shows (pages 204-206), the people we contact at the doors often meet us with evasive objections. They may say, “I’m satisfied I” “I’m not interested!” “I don’t want anything at all!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How can we help such a one? First of all, we should proceed with the idea that he is at heart better than he sounds and so we should appeal to him by our earnestness, sincerity, friendliness and cheerfulness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As to what to say: There are various approaches we could use. We could dismiss his objection with a “But,” or, “However,” and then make some striking statement, such as: “What if you had the opportunity to live forever?” Or, “Wouldn’t you like to live in a world without any war, sickness or crime? I’m sure you would!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Or we might agree with him at first, saying: “I also am satisfied with the many good things I enjoy such as health, security and some modern conveniences. However, I’m</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Carry Your Own Load &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the Society prefers publishers to work in pairs. But the Society’s counsel in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity,</span><span class="font10"> paragraph 21, says: “When we are able to present the message without difficulty, then, at every opportunity, we should go alone from house to house.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If we stop to think, it is obvious we can preach the Word of God more thoroughly when we work alone. Why, we cover twice as much territory by working alone! True, some will be working in pairs. Some territories, at certain times, may be dangerous to work alone. Or two may work together for a period in carrying out the training program. Even then the one being trained should be put on his own as soon as he shows sufficient maturity. Strength to carry this load of responsibility comes from Jehovah. You will be able to say with Paul: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Onward, then, in the Kingdom ministry. “Preach the word of God thoroughly.” Carrying youi- own load of responsibility will result in a thorough witness, better territory coverage and greater maturity. sure that you are no more satisfied than I am with the juvenile delinquency that keeps getting ever worse; nor with so many having to suffer unjustly, as in Hungary, are you? Of course, we cannot do anything about it individually, but it is a real comfort to know that God can and will, and that in the very near future. Speaking of our very time, note what the Bible says at Daniel 2:44 .. .”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Or, “It’s a real pleasure to meet someone that’s not grumbling, frustrated and dissatisfied. It’s foolish, isn’t it, just to be looking on the dark side of life when there are so many good things? However, did you ever pause to consider that there are many people for whom there seems to be no bright side, for instance, those behind the Iron Curtain, such as the Hungarians, or those in hospitals or in mental institutions? They would certainly like to see a better day. Will it ever come for them? What do you think? Did you know that the Bible shows that. ..”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> In such ways as the foregoing we can meet this common objection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Greek philosophers had called Paul a chatterer, but had no answer for what he said. So they bring him to the Areopagus, to Mars’ Hill, where representatives of the intelligentsia now listen to him. What a speech he gives! He wields the “word of truth” efficiently, ably.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What are the results? Some are mocking, others say they will hear him again, but some join themselves to him and become believers. Knowledge, careful thought, experience and Jehovah’s spirit enable Paul to produce these sound results, and an Athenian congregation is formed.</span></p></li>

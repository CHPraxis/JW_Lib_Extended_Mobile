<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Soars to 208,260—Goal Passed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">449,142 Subscriptions in 4 Months!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What rejoicing April’s report brings 1 It was our best yet. The goal that we so energetically sought was not only reached but surpassed. We needed 203,802 publishers; we attained 208,260! We strove for a 20-percent increase; we reached a 22.6-percent peak! Well done, Kingdom ministers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We rejoice that the report is so wholesome. Showing this is the fact that, though last year only 924 congregations reached the goal, this year 1,538 congregations, or 42.1 percent, reported, “We Made It!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Memorial Report</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> We rejoice too that the peaks are so many. Look at the grand Memorial report. Attending the Lord’s evening meal this year were 298,455 persons. Of these 7,060 partook of the emblems. Last year 260,703 attended and 7,449 were partakers. Here is an increase of 37,752—a 14.5-percent increase!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The result of the April special magazine work? It was our greatest month ever. Magazine placements soared to 4,724,095. Your work kept the presses in Brooklyn running extra time, but blessed extra-time work it was. April’s magazine placements were 1,369,928 more than any other month—a 40.8-percent increase. Congregation publishers averaged 17.7; pioneers 161.1; vacation pioneers 123.8 and special pioneers 230.3. Subscriptions in April were 113,348.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Another cause for rejoicing is the result of the four-month subscription campaign. It was our finest. We obtained 449,142 new subscriptions. Last year it was 408,540. This is an increase of 40,602, or 9.9 percent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Though the campaign has ended, this month brings opportunities for new subscriptions. The Society is sending congregations a number of expired subscription slips. You will want to make the calls in the way suggested in the May </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Can We Average a 10-Percent Increase?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Last year the average increase for the United States was about 4 percent. But now what do we behold? The inspiring prospect of a much greater increase. It appears reasonable that we can average for the whole service year a 10-percent increase. Let that be our goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> To gain a 10-percent year’s increase we need to average about 191,000 publishers each month for the remainder of the service year. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we can do this. See why it is possible: We have reached a more-than-20-per-cent peak with 208,260 publishers. An average of 191,000 publishers should be possible; we have four months remaining and good weather.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">“Maintaining Right Works”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> April saw many persons in the witness work for the first time. We want to help them to continue “to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JUNE Any two books and two booklets for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Enjoying Each One “His Own Gift from God.&quot;—1 Corinthians 7:7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">be rich in right works.” So follow the counsel of the apostle: “Concerning these things I desire you to make firm assertions constantly, in order that those who have believed God may keep their minds on maintaining right works. These things are right and beneficial to men.” —1 Tim. 6:18; Titus 3: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Servants and all publishers and pioneers—use your gift from God to aid these new ones to &quot;keep their minds on maintaining right works.” An outstanding provision to help us</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>IT!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">keep our mind on right works is the district assembly program. Here will be an abundance of spiritual food to help all “stay by these things” so beneficial to men.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> So that the new ones may keep their minds on maintaining right works we must bring them on to maturity. Some thus far have done only magazine work; aid them to expand their ministry. Help them prepare the sermon on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth.”</span><span class="font9"> Show them how joyful this service is.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Prepare for Summer Activity Now</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> Another way we can work toward a 10-percent year’s increase: Invite the new ones to share the blessings of the service to begin this month throughout the country—rural witnessing. All plan now for this refreshing activity. Since public meetings should be arranged for in rural sections throughout the summer, here is another blessing for these new Kingdom ministers. This summer concentrate on territory that was not covered during the winter, whether in the city or rurals. For the greatest benefits from rural witnessing review the suggestions in the July, 1956, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> Has your congregation a large supply of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font9"> books? If so, it would be well to work one of these books into the month’s offer. (See box.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> So prepare now for the summer joys. The potential for increase is great. Look at this: More than 90,000 persons who attended the Memorial did not publish in April. Help these many good-will persons begin right works and help the many new Kingdom ministers maintain right works. Doing this we have a fine prospect of reaching a 10-percent year’s increase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> Onward, then, into the joys ahead of us: aiding the weak to become strong, finding the sheep in rural witnessing and attending a district assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The Christian’s advancement is to “be manifest to all persons.” How is this advancement possible? Only through right training. Right training comes at congregational meetings, and the particular meeting that helps us to become more efficient teachers is the service meeting. Its importance cannot be overstressed. Every Kingdom publisher should attend every service meeting. But not only those attending have a responsibility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">—the speakers do too. The service meeting should get thoughtful and thorough preparation. The Society prepares the program. The servants must develop it. They apply it to their own area, really strengthening their congregation. But the congregation also must support the meeting, gaining the knowledge that leads to advancement, and then letting their growth in field ministry be “manifest to all persons.”—1 Tim. 4 :15.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Enjoying Each One “His Own Gift from God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on “Enjoying Each One ‘His Own Gift from God.’ ” (See “Watchtower,” 6/1/57, p. 350, and 10/1/56, p. 598.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 mln: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material on Law, from page 237 to Eph. 2:11-16, page 238. TO be handled as a discussion after a home Bible study of a question that came up during the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Consider main article “We Made It!” Have questions and answers for 15 minutes, then a 10-minute talk on subject. Include the part the local congregation had in meeting the goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on question taken from Ezekiel 9: 11 at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk on “Working Unassigned Territory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min; Question and answer coverage of “More and More Pioneers’” and then talk on vacation pioneer experiences taken from the “Yearbook.” Last year we had a peak of 5,809 vacation pioneers, as our 1957 “Yearbook” shows. (65) How many will we have this year? In British Guiana ten percent of the publishers availed themselves of this privilege. (96) If we did that in the United States we would have more than 19,000 vacation pioneers! In one congregation in Argentina fourteen brothers who enjoyed this treasure wrote a letter to the Society urging others to enjoy this happy privilege. (77) Vacation pioneering offers an excellent opportunity to share in working isolated territory, as three sisters in the Bahamas discovered. (87) Vacation pioneering can also serve to strengthen your faith and to aid you to grow to maturity, as one Korean sister learned. (191) And it can give you many opportunities to help others to advance to maturity, even as it did to two vacation pioneers in Panama. (235)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Demonstration on street magazine activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Mention spiritual prosperity of organization. Consider Isa. 2: 2, 3 and Ps. 35: 27, 28. Ever-increasing multitude talking of Jehovah’s righteousness. Society geared to supply all these servants with enough magazines for distribution. New factory and new presses. Magazine activity expanding world-wide. How about own congregation? Obtain from records average number of magazines placed monthly during service year thus far. Discuss this figure with congregation and compliment them on effort and any improvement made. This figure can become larger by means of street magazine activity. House-to-house magazine work has proved the most effective, but street work can also bring results. This is not possible by silently standing or just calling out slogans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Must approach people and talk with them. Use short presentation as is done at the doors. Here are four scenes showing how it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (7 min. total for all four scenes) Publisher approaches person waiting for a bus and says: “Hello. I would like to acquaint you with the latest copies of these religious magazines. You will find this particular article especially interesting [mention article]. You may have the two for ten cents.” Chairman makes brief comments between each scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II Publisher approaches person window shopping. “Hello. My name is [give name]. I would like to take this opportunity to present the latest issues of ‘The W atchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ I’m sure you’ll find this article most interesting [mention by name]. It’s just ten cents for the two of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III Publisher approaches man in parked car. “Hello. I thought you might like to make good use of your time while sitting here by reading this article in ‘Awake!’ You may have it and its companion magazine for ten cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE IV Publisher comes to a person by curb. “Hello. I’m sure you have seen ‘The Watchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ from time to time. There are two interesting articles here I know you’ll enjoy. The two magazines are just ten cents ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) These are suggested presentations. Others can be used. Chairman comments on effectiveness of talking to people and how it is the Scriptural way. Quotes and discusses Ps. 145: 11, 12. God is praised through the mouth and printed page at homes and on the streets. When in street witnessing approach people. Summarize by stressing the point that active street witnessing does bring results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Arrange locally. (include comments on “New World News.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THIRD MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 20 min: Through audience participation the chairman will develop the back-call sermon given in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Demonstration on How More Can Make Back-Calls. Show how easily back-call sermons can be prepared and delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Points to a stack of cartons or literature (in small congregations) on the platform. This (empty cartons) represents the amount of literature placed during the last five months. The number of back-calls made during the same period should be indicated in large figures on a piece of paper attached to the stack. Point out the difference between the aifiount of literature placed and the back-calls made. The difference shows the need for more to make back-calls. Perhaps some fail to make them because they feel incapable of giving a ten- to fifteen-minute back-call sermon. It is not difficult to prepare and give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (6 min.) Bible study servant calls on a publisher whose record card shows a low number of back-calls but good placements. Publisher says she has no trouble with the three- to eightminute sermon but has not given a back-call sermon. The servant points out how these sermons are very simple, being just an extension of the three- to eight-minute door-to-door sermons. He goes over the various points and scriptures of the door-to-door sermon, indicating where additional thoughts and scriptures can be worked in. He then suggests they give the enlarged sermon a try at a nearby back-call he has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (15 min.) The brother and sister approach a door. When it is opened he tells the householder that he made a special effort to call back, as he had promised. He asks permission to step in for a moment to point out a few more scriptures on the subject discussed at the first visit. After sitting down he proceeds with the back-call sermon for ten minutes. He makes it simple and clear, occasionally asking the householder a question. After concluding he points to a paragraph in “This Good News of the Kingdom” that is on the subject of his sermon. He proceeds to have the paragraph read and to ask the question on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Interrupts demonstration. He briefly reviews how the three- to eight-minute sermon was enlarged into a back-call sermon and how easily it can be done. He also mentions the manner in which it was presented to the householder and how it went smoothly into a study. He again draws attention to the stack of literature on the platform and suggests that the publishers try to close up the gap between the literature placements and the back-calls by each one’s applying the things learned in the demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on text (Acts 15: 36) at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material on Law, from top of page 239 through Rev. 5: 12, page 240. Handle by questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk covering material under “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Talk on article “The District Assemblies” and assembly conduct. Especially stress importance of being on time, of never walking in the corridors during the program, and of always staying until after the concluding talk and prayer before leaving seat. Show that no other, course is respectful to Jehovah or representative of his witnesses, and that individually we must set the right example regarding this. (See “Watchtower,” 7/1/53, p. 397, and if you have it, 7/1/57, p. 392.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Arrange locally. Consider any item important to your congregation.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Our working together in this way, building one another up in love, and Jehovah’s giving the increase have resulted in many more publishers making back-calls and holding Bible studies.

Following Jesus’ example the Society has been issuing a call by means of special letters for more and more pioneers, and thus far the response has been excellent.

Additionally, 4,840 enjoyed the vacation pioneer service during the 8 months from September 1, 1956, to April 30,1957. Moreover, hundreds of these enjoyed the vacation pioneer activity so much that they asked to be transferred to the regular pioneer service so as to keep on enjoying full-time blessings and privileges of service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Do you ask, Why do our brothers having oversight of the witness work keep on calling for more and more pioneers? Because as full-time servants themselves they want all who have the Scriptural responsibility to pioneer to enjoy this glorious treasure of service. They are greatly concerned with bringing honor to Jehovah’s name and with helping men of good will to come into the New World society. They also are aware of the subtle snare of materialism. They know that as a pioneer you will be devoting about ten times as many hours to preaching the good news ; will be making about ten times as many back-calls and conducting ten times as many home Bible studies as you would be if you remained a congregation publisher. Why, if just one out of every eight congregation publishers became a pioneer that would mean a hundred-percent increase in Kingdom preaching!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> More and more pioneers are needed, as there is much work to be done and the time is fast running out in which to do it. So how about you? Are you able to arrange your affairs so as to enjoy the pioneer service? Maybe you can help another so that that one can be a pioneer? And what about vacation pioneering? Surely if all have a proper appreciation of the importance of Kingdom preaching the ranks of the pioneer service will be swelled by thousands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What hope is there for the future? How can I find, pleasure and happiness? Who knows what is beyond the grave? Why be concerned about life? When will God intervene in world affairs? Are you able to answer? Peter said you should be. Christians are under obligation to answer concerning their hope, not theoretically, but Scripturally. —1 Pet. 3 :15.</span></p></li>

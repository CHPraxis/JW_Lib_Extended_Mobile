<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARING WITH JEHOVAH IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BY SPECIAL MAGAZINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>What a thrillingly grand opportunity April brings! Jehovah has blessed us with an outstanding provision to help us really share with him during April—special issues of the magazines, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> of April 15 and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of April 22. Both are expressly prepared for the public. Both present the truth in such a variety of ways, with such power that honest-hearted readers will hardly hold back from exclaiming to themselves : “This is the truth I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Presenting the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font10"> will be a joy. Very timely aud vital is its feature article “When All Men Again Worship One God.” How near is that time! People everywhere need to know it. Let them read how only one religion survived the Flood and how only one religion will survive Armageddon. Let them know it with the widest distribution of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> outlines not only this grand hope but it exposes false hopes, such as communism’s “paradise.” Christendom? Its spiritual famine and the peril it brings to the masses are made unmistakably clear. This article will appeal to those who feel doctrinal confusion is too much to solve, for it points out those things that are obviously wrong and easy to prove so from the Bible. For those whose problem is doctrinal, Questions from Beaders shatters false doctrines concerning the earth and trinity, yet “instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.”—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font10"> Tim. 2: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> presents overwhelmingly powerful reasons for belief in the Bible. A question-and-answer article tells who Jehovah’s witnesses are. It dispels false impressions.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' The big ingathering work for the year is on. Are you ' sharing in It7</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">At the Memorial celebration on April 14 how close to , one million attendance shall we come? April should see , most of last year’s 919,994 attenders in field service and <sup>F </sup>i distributing millions of magazines. What win the new । peak of ministers be? Already this year we have a new peak of 650,291 reporting on both sides of the “iron cur, tain.” How thrilling to see the other sheep coming ini &lt;&nbsp;May you be blessed as you share with Jehovah in the ' ingathering work this April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With you telling the good news from day to day, ,</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study will be first, then the Memorial service, after 6 p.m.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Every publisher should be out on this special day of service. New ones will be started for the first time. All should be urged to attend the Sunday morning contact. A special program will be arranged. The text will be discussed, a mature brother should give a stirring ten-minute talk on the importance of serving Jehovah, and a demonstration on the use of the sermon on “Jehovah.” The groups may meet a few minutes earlier than usual for this program at either the Kingdom Hall or the service centers. This may well be the greatest single day of service yet.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Watchtower” subscription for one year and the booklet “What Do the Scriptures Say About ‘Survival After</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Death'?&quot; for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Share with Jehovah, Not with Demons. —1 Corinthians 10:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BY 20-PERCENT INCREASE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Producing fruitage is vital. A tree that produces is not “cut down and thrown into the fire.” The Christian, too, is known by his fruits. —Matt. 7:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How is the fruitage produced? All who have heard must likewise invite others to take life’s water free and to join in inviting still others. How can we aid them to do so?—Rev. 22 :17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We aid them through diligent watering, through nurturing and cultivating every place where seeds of truth can sprout. By our happiness and enthusiasm, and by our radiation of the goodness of the Kingdom news, we turn over long-unmoved soil, improving its receptiveness. Do you diligently apply these Scriptural, principles to your daily service? Doing so is obedience to God, and a major part of right worship. It is a requirement for those who will gain life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> How can these principles be applied during April to achieve the 20-percent increase, the goal of 203,802 publishers? By applying the slogan: “Each one help one.” The more than 140,000 home Bible studies should be urged to serve. They should be aided in. preparing magazine presentations as outlined in October “Presenting the Good News” and in service as explained in Study 56 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Thousands are ready. From them the 20-percent increase will come. Help them serve Jehovah, becoming active door-to-door publishers. Then, of course, all other publishers should be out. Those not reporting by Sunday, April 14, will be given special attention, and April’s 203,802 goal should be reached and surpassed. Congregations who meet or exceed their 20-percent quota will write “We Made It 1” on the bottom of the April monthly report card.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Our April activity is threefold, thus the service meetings have been arranged to stress each of the three major features of the activity: (1) the 20-per-cent increase, (2) the Memorial with its special day of service, and (3) distribution of the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines.

<p><span class="font10">“take for granted that all the brothers desire to do the right thing and to serve Jehovah, and will do it when they see and understand how.” Thus the service meeting programs should not command or order the brothers, but should lead them and encourage them, showing them the best ways of participating in service, and pointing out its importance. Jehovah richly blesses such well-prepared meetings outlined and presented in harmony with His Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">FIRST MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Share with Jehovah, Not with Demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on “Share with Jehovah, Not with Demons.” (See “Watchtower.” 4/1/57, p. 222, and 1/15/50, p. 44.) ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 mint Demonstration on “New World Society in Action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">NEWS REPORTER (2 min.) A “new world news reporter” explains April’s special activity, and tells of the BIG DAY Sunday, April 14. He explains that he will question various ones to see how they have prepared for this activity. He interviews the following<sup>-</sup>:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Regular Publisher (3 min.) Publisher states he plans to be out himself Sunday April 14, without fail; also mentions the arrangements he has made to personally increase and support the distribution of the April 15th and 22d issues, as well as other activities. Wants to encourage weaker brothers to share. Desires to co-operate fully with all arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Publisher Who Conducts a Home Bible Study (3 min.) Reporter asks how long has had study and what will be done to help person to share in special activity. Has publisher say in exact w’ords what he is going to say to his study to encourage him in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Book Study Conductor (4 min.) Conductor stresses he will make every effort to see that all are out by the 14th, how those who have not been will be called on and encouraged by use of Scriptures as to the importance of field service, and practical assistance offered to overcome obstacles to service. Is determined to see that each one in his service center is out praising Jehovah. April 14 is the BIG DAY for him too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Magazine-Territory Servant (5 min.) States how many of the special issue the congregation has received, and what arrangements have been made for brothers to support and share in special distribution. Gives sample presentations on using special issues (one for each magazine), uses reporter as householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregation Servant (5 min.) Reporter asks him about the prospects for making the 20-percent goal, according to the Publisher’s Record cards and the potential from the number of home Bible studies. Questioned also about Memorial arrangements, and what he anticipates in regard to congregation’s activity. Is he optimistic, enthusiastic? Is the congregation ready for April’s special activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">NEWS REPORTER (3 min.) Expresses confidence. Summarizes all points, highlights the readiness of each one in the congregation, that all are equipped, know what to do and how to do it. Is hopeful that congregation will have greatest month, as all work together praising Jehovah and aiding one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Talk on Brother Knorr’s letter and the part of the main article entitled “By 20-Percent Increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include the reading of the pioneer letter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SECOND MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on “Yearbook” experiences on the quickness of new ones to share in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That it is not necessary to wait cautiously many months before encouraging those with whom we conduct home Bible studies to share in the preaching work can be seen from the following experiences found in our 1957 “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Morocco an ex-Catholic man from the first study began publishing. (149) After studying six weeks a family of three in Ceylon joined in the house-to-house work and has continued to do so since. (Ill) In Austria a publisher found herself discussing service with a woman just eight days after first meeting her and who, after eight weeks, handed in a report of 29 hours for her first month’s activity. (84) Two months after first being witnessed to a young Tunisian man reported 30 hours of field service. (151) In Singapore, after studying but two weeks, a Chinese man accompanied the publisher from house to house and in just a matter of weeks was giving sermons on his own. (258) These examples suffice to show that we should mention service early to our home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">27 mtn: Demonstration on “Know Your Magazine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Have brothers obtain April 15 issues of “The Watchtower” on Sunday April 7. Encourage them to search out practical points to ask the panel of experts (3 or 4 in number). Points chosen should be those that would be of interest in the field, not some deliberately picked to stump the experts. Ask questions having to do with service problems. Show by your questions that “The Watchtower” can be used under different situations and be applied to different people, with different religions, living under various circumstances. Ask questions dealing with objections met at the doors, on back-calls, Bible studies, as well as on points of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Introduce demonstration highlighting meeting theme. State briefly what kind of questions are desired. See that different ones have opportunity to question panel. Be prepared to contribute to the questions asked and comments made by making practical application of the comment, but very briefly. For example, you might say, “That’s an excellent paragraph to remember when working a Jewish or a Catholic neighborhood.” Or, “We can use that information on our back-calls,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Have audience question panel. Keep session lively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6 min: Have panel use “Check Your Memory” to question the audience. Panel should be prepared to show how their points can be used in the field service, or how they can be worked in with the sermon, if the publishers fail to bring them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Summarize practical points, and include material from “Sharing with Jehovah in April —By Special Magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Sharing with Jehovah in April—By Memorial Activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THIRD MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Combine the use of a talk and questions to bring out the main points in the “Congregation Organization” article “Another Goal—Congregation Increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Talk on April 22 “Awake!” contents, bringing out points that can be used in presenting it in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Talk on “Presenting the Good News: Using the Special Offer.” In course of talk speaker might have couples demonstrate some presentations. Also, check in advance to get some good experiences the publishers have had in using the suggested presentations ; conclude by having them relate these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FOURTH MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 mln: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Enthusiastic talk on pioneer letter and “Plan to Vacation Pioneer.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Consider some local service problem, congregational obligations and behavior, matters of general encouragement, or whatever is felt will be of particular value to your congregation. You may do this either by a discourse or by a demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include mention of 1957 District Assemblies for U.S. and Canada.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—Congregation Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Of our seven goals congregational increase is the one we will be especially interested in in April. To realize it we must ever bear in mind that the purpose of our field service is not just to report hours, back-calls and literature placements but to help fulfill the prophecy that “the little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation.”—Isa. 60 : 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Those with whom we study should be directed to the service center study and congregation meetings as soon as possible within a few weeks or months at most. Also begin early to leave them some handbills or tracts to distribute. The sooner they get the idea of service the better. Invite them to join you as you make back-calls and engage in the house-to-house activity. Have them hand the handbill to the householder and read some of the texts that are part of your sermon. Prepare them for the magazine activity by helping them learn a thirty- to sixty-second presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When we have helped them to the point of dedication and activity in the field service, is that all we need to do? No, it is not, for the records show that in the past three years in the United States alone some 24,000 thus began and then dropped out. Why? Evidently they failed to make progress and so needed someone to again teach them “from the beginning the first prin-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">ciples of the sacred pronouncements of God.”—Heb. 5:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Yes, these facts drive home to us the truth that we must help those who have taken their stand to “press on to maturity” and not leave them to shift for themselves too quickly. Even though we cannot count the time after they have symbolized their dedication by water immersion we should be willing to study with them if they still need our help. They may not have completed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font10"> If they have, what about </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”?</span><span class="font10"> Going through this Bible study aid will help them to “have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong,” and be able to partake of solid spiritual food.—Heb. 6:1; 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Let us also continue helping them in their field service. As Paul counsels: “We, though, who are strong ought to bear’ the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves.” (Rom. 15:1) Help them in working out a service schedule, make definite arrangements for working together and then be dependable, zealous, yet show loving patience. Help them to prepare in advance their sermons and then privately counsel them as you hear them preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> By helping our good-will studies to become service-minded, by continuing to assist those who have taken their stand to reach maturity, by being willing to devote the necessary time to it, we can hope to realize our goal of congregational increase.</span></p></li></ul>

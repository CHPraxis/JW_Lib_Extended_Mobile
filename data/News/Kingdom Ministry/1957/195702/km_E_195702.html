<p><span class="font0">ALL NEED THE KINGDOM!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower” Announces It Are You a Distributor?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Everyone needs God’s kingdom. No one can gain everlasting life without it. Whatever one’s status in life, whatever work one does, whatever education one has, whatever one’s health, he needs the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> No exceptions exist, not even for the rich. True, persons from wealthy families may think they do not need the Kingdom. They are deceived. “Because you say: ‘I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,’ but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked.” The richest man in the world is spiritually poor, blind and naked unless he acts on his need for the Kingdom.—Rev. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>s</sup> So whatever one has or is, if he does not awake to his need for the Kingdom, he is just as miserable and pitiable as the crowds for whom Jesus “felt tender affection . . . because they were skinned and knocked about like sheep without a shepherd.” Wolves of false religion have harried the people, leaving them bleeding, “skinned and knocked about.” How badly they need healing Kingdom truths I—Matt. 9: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> But “how, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent forth?” So Jesus trained and sent forth Kingdom preachers. They went to all kinds of men. Look at just a few of the people who listened: The jailer of Phillipi, a businesswoman of the same city, a physician, the wealthy tax collector of Jericho, the governor of Cyprus, the treasure keeper of the queen of the Ethiopians, a judge on the supreme court of Athens, yes, and even some of the royal household of the Roman emperor!—Rom. 10:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Going into Active Training</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jesus promised Kingdom preachers for today. For spreading the Kingdom good news, today’s Kingdom ministers have a valuable instrument. This is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Not only has it helped them announce the Kingdom, but it has helped them train for effective witnessing. Declared the apostle: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim. ... as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” (1 Tim. 4:7, 8) The ancient athlete trained for a contest. He built his body up with nourishing food and strenuous exercise. A contender for the prize of life must also go into training. How?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10 Percent Increase.* WE MADE IT!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Goal Reached in December with 189,517 Publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Yes, we made it! For the first time in any December since we have had our goal of a 10-percent increase in publishers by December, we made it! We have made the goal of 20 percent by April before, but never the 10 percent by December. The expansion is in high gear again, it is really rolling, and with Jehovah’s blessing and continued hard work we should have an even more thrilling report by April!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The 189,517 publishers reporting thus far exceeds, for the first time, the April, 1955, peak when we had the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christi-</span><span class="font10">food. Then he must exercise. He exercises his whole body, mind, arms, tongue and feet by going to people with the Kingdom good news. “How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things I” —Rom. 10:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> In awakening all kinds of people to the Kingdom need, Kingdom preachers have used </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> well. During the 1955 fourmonth </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign they averaged 1.6 subscriptions per minister. In 1956 it was 1.8. This year what is their goal? To reach two subscriptions per publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> So Kingdom ministers, go into active training I Make certain your sermon is effective. To help you during February, the second month of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign, let each service center feature a special program after the daily text for the four Sundays.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> This is the schedule. First Sunday, review the sermon on Jehovah’s name. Second Sunday, review talking points of the offer. Third Sunday, discuss how to overcome local objections. Fourth Sunday, discuss effective introductions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page col. 2')</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">anity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font10"> booklet campaign. December’s 189,517 publishers was an 11.6-percent increase over last year’s average.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> That this increase was sound is further shown by the average of 10.2 hours, over 13 magazines and the maintenance of the other service averages. All this, of course, was excellent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If your congregation wrote “We Made It!” at the. bottom of its card, maintain that good report and press forward toward April. If it did not, then be encouraged by those who did, and press even more diligently forward toward that April goal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">One of our goals is better meetings. This outline is to help toward that goal. An important feature is the timing of the various parts. For meetings to go overtime regularly is wrong. It will hurt attendance. Some publishers have children to put to bed. The audience becomes restless when meetings run over, and what is then said is not attended to closely. If some speakers</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">go overtime habitually they should not be used for a while. If any of the servants do this, other servants might speak to them about it.

<p><span class="font9">FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Gaining God’s Reward by Active Training.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Gaining God’s Reward by Active Training.” (See “Watchtower,” 2/1/57, p. 93, and 4/15/56, p. 248.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min? Demonstration on use of the “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Talk on value of “Yearbook” to publishers. Emphasize need of reading it as soon as posr sible. Show how “Yearbook” acquaints one with whole theocratic body, builds love for brothers, helps in prayer, broadens our appreciation for what God is doing.'—1 Cor. 12: 14-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Series of Interviews (13 min.). Have brothers tell how they arrange affairs and surmount obstacles to read “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Theocratic family. Father tells how he reads text and comments each morning, while one of the older children, who eats little, reads the reports. CHAIRMAN TO AUDIENCE: Morning may not be convenient for you to read reports. Perhaps noon or evening better. Adjust to time that suits you best.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Sister whose husband is not in truth tells how she arranges. She reads after husband goes to work. On weekends after he has gone to sleep or before he gets up. Sometimes on way to work, on lunch hours, but tries to consider at least three pages each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Brother whose wife is not in truth reads on way to and from work. Says that way he has always something fresh to tell wife, who is not opposed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Sister with opposed husband waits till he goes to work before she considers reports with children. Or when she tucks them in bed. Brother with opposed wife waits till wife goes shopping or is preparing meal. That way children are not left out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. Young brother and sister whose parents are not in truth tell how they cover “Yearbook.” Before dropping off to sleep, or before rising. Read portion going to school on bus or at noon hour. In evening sometimes consider with homework.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Summarize various ways mentioned in the interviews. Encourage all to special effort to use “Yearbook” to learn about their brothers, broaden personal knowledge and love for them. “Yearbook” will help us to understand their problems, appreciate their needs, to pray for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Talk on the article “All Need the Kingdom!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include the reading of the new pioneer letter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SECOND MEETING IN FEBRUARY 5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: “The Bible’s Kingdom Theme.” A talk based on “Make Sure of All Things”, material under heading “Kingdom.” Page 226 to Revelation 20:4, 6 on page 229.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Congregation Organization.” 10 min: Chairman selects individuals to present briefly the following “Yearbook” experiences showing the need for more pioneers. Even worldlings are impressed when one leaves a good secular job to pioneer, as the “Yearbook” shows in regard to a sister in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(122) And encouragingly, in the United' States for the first time in four years there was an increase in pioneers. (64)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, a part-time job may not be waiting for you, but by the time you try from 70 to 80 times you doubtless will find a good one, as did a certain Swiss pioneer. (274) True, you may have obstacles, but these can be overcome, as the mother of five in Hawaii showed. (167)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And pioneers do have many joyous experiences. How would you like to go to an isolated territory where 25 persons are waiting for you to come and teach them the F;ble, as did a Guatemalan special pioneer? (164) Or how would you like to have an experience similar to that of the Ethiopian pioneer who was able to report nine publishers after working but two months in isolated territory*’ (141)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on the pioneer letter read the previous week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Arrange locally, but stress the December report for the country, especially the article “16 Percent Increase: WE MADE IT!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THIRD MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on “Yearbook” experiences on booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom”, showing its effectiveness in teaching the truth to those who have obtained literature. Start studies in it, for it surely contains ‘the milk of the Word.’ Our 1957 “Yearbook” tells of the excellent results obtained by using it for study in British Guiana (96) and in Great Britain. (100)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Pakistan 60 percent of the studies are started with this booklet. (234) In Northern Rhodesia one very successful missionary starts every study first with it. (224) The report from Uruguay also tells of results obtained by means of studies in this booklet. (282)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After but two studies in this booklet a good-will person in the Gold Coast began attending meetings and is now a publisher, though blind. (155) After only a few weeks of study in this booklet a good-will person in Venezuela witnessed to others. (285)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Develop a model back-call sermon on theme of Jehovah’s name, as follow-up for doorstep sermon on the same theme. School servant or competent brother should be chairman. CHAIRMAN (10 min.) Point out value of well-prepared back-call sermon and eagerness to present it; so as not to depend upon householder’s questions for success of back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Discuss information regarding Jehovah’s name. Of prime importance. (Ezek. 36:21, 22) Appears at least 6,823 times in Bible. Is highlighted time and again by its vindication through mighty acts. Satan has caused Jewish traditionalists to hide it from view. Same mistake made by King James Version. Temporarily restored by the American Standard Version; obliterated by the Revised Standard Version. The New World Translation puts it in its rightful place in both Hebrew and Greek Christian Scriptures. For additional points see “The Watchtower,” September 1, 1953, and forewords in New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, Volume 1, and New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DISCUSSION (10 min.) Two qualified brothers work out back-call sermon between them. Offer suggestions as to introduction, connectives, show logic of order of texts and have conclusion leading to suggestion for a home Bible study with booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom”. Use following texts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Name of Jehovah in King James and Douay (footnote) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Ex. 6:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus made it known &nbsp;&nbsp;—John; 17:6</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why we are known as Jehovah’s witnesses &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 43:10-12</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today some scoff as did Pharaoh</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—Ex. 5:2</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why God allows such to remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—Ex. 9:16 Destiny of enemies of Jehovah’s name</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—Ps. 83:17, 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For protection seek Jehovah, righteousness, meekness &nbsp;&nbsp;—Zeph. 2:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s name a strong tower</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—Prov. 18:10</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Give summary in form of condensed version of back-call sermon, touching on all scriptures used. In making back-call take along American Standard Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Talk on the article “Private Homes as Service Centers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Discuss the slogan at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FOURTH MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: Talk on slogan at bottom of page 4, which is based on 2 Timothy 2:2. (“Qualified to Be Ministers,” pp. 9-15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: Demonstration bringing out points in the' article “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 mln: Each congregation will use this time as it thinks best. There may be some local problem that needs discussion. You may want to have a talk based on a “Watchtower” article that appeared in the last year or two. Plan effective use of this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Arrange locally. (Mention points about subscription slips.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Another of our seven goals for 3957 is back-call work and Bible study activity. Why stress these? Because during the past six months 38 percent of the publishers did not share in back-call activity, and 67 percent did not share in Bible study work. This means that in an average congregation of fifty publishers, nineteen made no back-calls and thirty-five conducted no home Bible studies. Did you stress these as you should?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Why stress these? Because it is through this activity that the sheep are fed. When you set a bowl of food before a baby your work is not done, but you must patiently feed him. The same is true in our ministerial activity. W’e cannot provide the sheep with food, then fail to feed them.—Heb. 5:13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Jesus said it is by feeding the “young lambs” or “little sheep” that we show love for the Master. Are you actually engaged in this feeding? The apostles did not search for people who were interested, then fail to teach them. Neither should we, after spending hours searching for the sheep, fall to go back to help them into the truth.—John 21:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> We place millions of pieces of literature, but for it to do its service we must be thorough in following it up. Are you? Do you equal the congregation’s quota and average in back-calls, and do you have at least one Bible study each month? If not, can you.arrange to do so?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHECK SUBSCRIPTION SLIPS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Print plainly the information on the subscription slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Spell out in full the name of the street and the post office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Be sure you have the right post office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Give all necessary information, such as apartment numbers, box numbers, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Mark the slip clearly as to the length of the subscription, and also whether it is new or renewal. After a subscription has expired for two months it is considered new.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Show the language in which the magazine is desired </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font10"> other than English. Be sure to obtain subscriptions only for the languages listed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Congregation servants should check the slips carefully before mailing them to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> All subscriptions, new and renewal, and also, change of address forms, should be sent in each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Finally, be sure to call back on each subscriber and see that he is receiving the magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Is it the time that hinders you? Do you hesitate at being tied down? It is easy to do so, but is your life really that busy? Is it not rather a matter of adjusting your thinking, or of better scheduling? Once you may have thought you could not spare Sunday mornings—now you accept Sunday’s service as a vital part of life. But is that Sunday service finished until it is followed through with back-calls and Bible studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The Bible study servant should take the lead in encouraging and working with the brothers. The study conductors should take personal interest in helping each publisher at a time. These servants must take this responsibility seriously. If they du, excellent results can be achieved. They have the responsibility of helping, but the responsibility is also upon each individual publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Do you really put the third hour on Sunday into back-call or Bible study activity, and do you really support the midweek back-call night? Is it your firm goal to convert one or more back-calls into Bible studies ? Do you and your training program companion really work toward this vital goal? By doing so you will reach not only your goal of improved back-call activity, but that activity will also aid your development toward the other goals of regularity, maturity and congregational increase. So press ever forward in this vital part of your ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Private Homes as Service Centers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When we dedicated our lives we dedicated our all, our resources, our energy, even our private homes. “What man is there that has built a new house and has not dedicated it?” (Deut. 20:5) David did. He sang the 30th Psalm, ‘a song at the dedication of the house of David.’ In Jehovah’s organization today, as in times of old, the private home is an outstanding instrument through which persons of good will may ga in knowledge and appreciation of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Brothers should be eager to use their homes . in Jehovah’s service. Even when under house arrest the apostle Paul saw to it that his house was used as a theocratic center: “They now arranged for a day with him, and they came in greater numbers to him in his lodging-place. . . . So he remained for an entire two years in his own hired house, and he would kindly receive all those who came in to him, preaching the kingdom of God.”—Acts 28: 23, 30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As Paul traveled he honored certain homes by establishing congregations in them. The home of Philemon was chosen. “To Philemon, our beloved one . . . and to the congregation that is in your house.” Sister Nympha evidently offered her home for use by the congregation. Paul sent greetings when writing the Co-lossians: “Give my greetings ... to Nympha and to the congregation at her house.” Aquila and Prisca did the same. “Aquila and Prisca together with the congregation that is in their house greet you heartily in the Lord.”—Phllem. 1, 2; Col. 4:15; 1 Cor. 16:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Today we too have the privilege of using our homes in dedicated service by using them as service centers. In urban territory, if possible, the service centers should be so situated that publishers and good-will persons will be within walking distance. In rural territory every fair-sized settlement or village should have a service center.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Have you notified your congregation servant that your home is available for dedicated service? It was a private home Bible study, a service center, that was blessed many years ago when the modern-day restoration of the truth began. This service center has grown into the spiritually strong, healthy, world-* wide organization it is today. Homes such as these are today being blessed by Jehovah. Truly at Proverbs 3: 33 it states: “The home of the righteous he blesses.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Overcoming Objections</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Almost every door in our ministry presents a challenge. Our aim is to overcome the people’s objections and present the good news. This cannot be done without preparation and thoughtful application. Paul counsels that we “go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside, buying out the opportune time for yourselves. Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.”—Col. 4:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To do this we must give thoughtful consideration to the objections we meet in the field and then prepare tactful replies. Often a single word or a ready phrase will clear the way for the truth to be presented. Read pages 204-207 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font10"> Rehearse your replies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A common objection today is: “But I know all those things. We read the Bible and, besides, we get the same thing in church every week.” Warmly reply: “If you have this information then you know why I am here. You realize the great need for us to do what the Bible says at Ephesians 4:25 [open your Bible and begin your sermon on the Kingdom] : ‘Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.’ ” The greatest truth today is about God’s kingdom. Develop your sermon and conclude by showing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> announces Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Or you might say: “That’s fine, if you do. Because we find many churchgoers so often don’t know these things, that God’s kingdom has been set up 1914, that Christ is now ruling, that Armageddon is near, that people are going to live on earth forever, and many other things. For example, many people wonder about this scripture.” Start sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another objection is: “We are not allowed to read that magazine.” Reply: “Have you ever wondered why?” Or, “Did they tell you why?” Say: “You read newspapers and various magazines, don’t you? Most likely to inform yourself. Take these magazines in the same frame of mind. See for yourself what they have to offer and then decide what you really think of them.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Or you might answer: “Strange you should say that, because </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> especially appeals to religious people. They like it because it keeps a sharp focus on Bible truth and views religious news generally. For example,” then go into article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Or say: “Did you know there are only 640,000 Jehovah’s witnesses, but nearly 3,000,000 readers of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font10"> This shows that Catholics, Protestants, Jews and people of other religions take </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> because it is of benefit to them. It could greatly aid you too. A full year’s subscription is only one dollar.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Most often it is not what we say, but how we say it. If we speak out with sincerity, warmth and friendliness, letting the spirit of God shine through, we shall be effective. Draw the people into our conversation. Give people a chance to warm up. After creating a friendly beachhead, then give your sermon. Be flexible, adaptable, kind. Remember, you or one of your brothers will be calling again at that door.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MARCH “Watchtower&quot; subscription for one year and the booklet “What Do the’ Scriptures Say About ‘Survival After</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Gaining God's Reward</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. <sup>11</sup> Because you trained yourself “with godly devotion as your aim” and aided others to do so too, your reward is great. Fearlessly you can go to all kinds of men. You say: “Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies;... I understand more than the aged, because I have kept thy precepts.”—Ps. 119: 98,100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> But there is more to your reward. It is the “promise of the life now and that which is to come.” Endless life in happiness is the indescribably grand reward for those who “stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>

What a joyful satisfaction to you right now! And your joy will continue, for in the new world, throughout all eternity, there will exist visible proof of your Kingdom preaching. Whenever you see the persons you aided to gain life, your heart cannot help but thrill. Both then and now it is certain to be just as the apostle exclaimed : “What thanksgiving can we render to God concerning you in return for all the joy with which we are rejoicing on your account?*’</span></p></li>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Making Known His Name and Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Helping in the “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is “the fountain of life,” Our life and the life of every living thing depends upon Jehovah’s interest in his creation. It is fortunate for us that Jehovah is interested in mankind. .Our very existence is proof of this fact, because “by him we have life and move and exist,” said Paul.—Ps. 36:9; Acts 17: 22-28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> While God is interested in mankind, how many of mankind are interested in God? Not many. And only those who do show interest in God will share in his favor and life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Are you interested in Jehovah? To what extent are you devoted to him? Are you sharing his interests with others? At present God’s interests are: to gather his “other sheep” before Armageddon, to have the good news of his kingdom preached in all the earth for a witness, to warn the wicked of the day of vengeance and, of utmost importance, to make his name known, for “anyone that calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved.” Jehovah “does not desire any to be destroyed,” but that is exactly what will happen to them if they do not get to know Jehovah and share fully his interests.—Acts 2: 21; 2 Pet. 3: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Christendom claims to know Jehovah. Have you found this true? One publisher reports that at fifteen successive doors the question was asked, What is God’s name? and not one of the fifteen could answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Now, how can these people call upon Jehovah whom they do not know? How can they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How can they share in Jehovah’s interests if they do not know what those interests are? That is why you who do know Jehovah must share fully the knowledge of Jehovah and his purposes.—Rom. 10:13-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> There is no better way of sharing Jehovah’s interests than to get people to subscribe for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The -Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Each issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> is devoted exclusively to Jehovah’s interests. If they cannot afford a year’s subscription for a dollar, get them to accept a single copy along with the booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Do the Scriptures Say About &quot;Survival After Death”?</span><span class="font12"> on a fifteen-cent contribution. “Whether they listen or decline to listen,” speak Jehovah’s words.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT APRIL INCREASE ANTICIPATED</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazines and the 20-Percent Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Paul said: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” We are the planters and wa-terers today, and must do our work before Jehovah will provide the growth. Great planting and watering are forecast for April. Great increase is anticipated.—1 Cor. 3: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Will you participate? Certainly! Why? Because you recognize the work’s urgency. Special magazines will be used. Special articles will make a particular appeal to the public. Special activity will put this information into the people’s hands. hovah’s interests with them. This means we shall keep a record of our placements, of subscription promises and be diligent at calling back, with the idea in mind of starting a Bible study with interested ones. The back-call sermon outlined in the February </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> will greatly aid you in doing this. So use it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> One publisher, who kept a record of all prospects, was able to get 83 subscriptions in 1955, and increased that number to 145 in 1956. Now, how effective have you been the first two months of this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign? Are your results good? If not, why not? Ask yourself, Wherein have I failed? Am I prepared? Do I have my sermon well in mind? Do I share regularly in the house-to-house work? Almost all subscriptions come from this feature of the service. Be a regular publisher, Have you overlooked anyone—your neighbors, your friends, your relatives? Give everyone </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> chance to know Jehovah and to call upon his name to be saved. —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Help all, especially the new and irregular ones, to attend first “to all the interests of the Eternal.” —1 Chron. 26: 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> A good supply of these magazines should be ordered now. (See the notice: “Order Special Magazines Now.”) Each congregation should plan to distribute at least as many as it did last April. The special April quotas for congregation publishers will be 27; for pioneers, 180, for special pioneers, 270.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The winter’s planting and watering should now produce the Godgiven increase. December saw a new peak. Surely with vigorous April activity we can see an even greater growth. The 20-percent goal is 203,802 publishers. Shall we be able to raise a nationwide shout: “We Made It !” ?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">This month some congregations will have four service meetings and some wiil have five, depending on which evening of the week they meet. Below are outlines for four service meetings, the first three and the last one of the month. If your congregation has only four meetings, this last one will be your fourth one,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Serving First the Divine Interests.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on “Serving First the Divine Interests.” (See “Watchtower,” 3/1/57, p. 157, and 7/15/56, p. 428.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Question-and-answer coverage of “Sharing Jehovah’s Interests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Demonstration on “Prepare Your Minds for Kingdom Activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Preparation is the key for opening up a door to service with greater joys, courage and success. The command is: “Brace up your minds for activity.”—1 Pet. 1: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (4 min.) Brothers meet in field at end of day’s activity. One has had fine results; he has given the sermon on God’s name many times and has made good placements. Other brother, having had little results, consoles himself with thought he must have gotten all the goats. Discussion turns to presentation. Brother Prepared finds Brother Unprepared really unprepared for Kingdom activity. He begins to tell Unprepared what his trouble is, when scene suddenly ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (5 min. soliloquy) Unprepared is at home, thinking out loud about what Prepared said. He tells himself of need to brace up his mind for happier, more successful Kingdom activity. He gets &quot;Kingdom Ministry” out and refreshes himself as to what is to be said. He runs through scriptures to make certain he can find them readily. He quizzes himself on how to get into sermon, how to move smoothly from one scripture to another, how to get into the offer. He finds a point in “The Watchtower” that he can bring to the householder’s attention, thereby stimulating interest for taking subscription. Prepared now he sits back with a contented expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Chairman interrupts. But is he fully prepared? Practice is part of preparing for activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE III (6 min. soliloquy) Unprepared reasons aloud that he has sermon well in mind; then he remembers the need to practice it just as he does a platform talk. He decides to look for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">member of the family or find a mirror. He finds a mirror. (This might be an empty wooden frame facing audience.) After checking his appearance, cheerful countenance, etc., he begins sermon; but he finds that his first few words need smoothing out. Then he begins again and goes from introduction to subscription offer. At completion he expresses feeling that he can now go into Kingdom service with greater pleasure, confidence and success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Encourage all to benefit from preparation, try this arrangement and thus brace up their minds for activity.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Arrange locally. (Includereading of the latest pioneer letter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on the pioneer letter read the previous meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Demonstration on “Overcoming Obstacles to Pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Open with thoughts on the Society’s stressing of pioneer service. Show that it is an urgent matter for all dedicated Kingdom ministers; they should be striving for the goal. Why are not more pioneers? What are the obstacles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (6 min.) A group of four or five publishers are relaxing at the home of a brother. The conversation turns to pioneer service. One remarks about the number of letters the Society has sent out reminding us of privilege and responsibility to pioneer. All express they are conscious of it and that their goal is the full-time service. Discussion turns to obstacles that seem to stand in the way of immediate pioneer service. One expresses his reason to be that his health is not good. Another has family obligations, another an opposing husband. Another worries how he can meet financial needs and still pioneer. All express desire to be better publishers while working to be pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (10 min.) Chairman calls on a special panel to offer suggestions on ways to overcome obstacles. From the platform panel will discuss the obstacles one by one with the chairman directing the discussion. Pioneers may well be used on the panel. AU who are on it should be well prepared to offer practical suggestions for overcoming the four obstacles: (1) Health, (2) finances, (3) opposition in family, and (4) family obligations. In discussing obstacle four, point should be made that if parents with children cannot pioneer now, perhaps they can move to a city where the need is great. If panelists know of experiences of brothers who have overcome any of the obstacles, these may be related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Where there is a will there is usually a way to do more in Jehovah’s service. Jehovah has given us the spirit of a sound mind. Are we using it to overcome obstacles? Having the will, let us apply the suggestions. More can be pioneers.—2 Tim. 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk based on “Pursuing My Purpose in Life” series that has appeared in “The Watchtower.” Gather from these various personal stories illustrations of different obstacles and how they were overcome and show the joyful privileges that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include some comments on the slogan at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 mtn: Question-and-answer cover-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">but for those congregations that have five, this last one will be the fifth one. That means their fourth meeting is not outlined for them and they should arrange it locally, according to their needs. The last one here outlined should be the last one of the month, as it prepares us for the special activity of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">age of “Work with the Circuit Servant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Demonstration to bring out the points on introducing the sermon on God’s name, as given in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk on “Regularity in Service.” See “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally, but call attention to “The 1957 District Assemblies!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LAST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Cover “Make Sure of All Things” material from “Is a Theocratic Government,” page 229, to Luke 2:14 on page 232. Handle it as a back-call, explaining the Kingdom to a good-will person who has present a representative of one of Christendom’s false religions. During the discussion the religionist expresses the usual misconceptions, such as the Kingdom’s being within one and also that faithful men of old and all of Christ’s sheep will go to heaven. His points are to be refuted and the truth presented by means of the scriptures listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Talk to bring out “Yearbook” experiences relative to the 1956 April campaign with the special issue of “The Watchtowefi,” and which should spur enthusiastic participation in the 1957 special campaign. Millions of extra copies were placed. In Australia some placed 90 a day; one group of six placed 500 in one day. (79) In British Honduras a copy placed with an indifferent businessman resulted in a study with him and his wife that has continued in spite of strong religious opposition. (98) One Mexican after reading it was ready not only for a Bible study but also to go out in the service at once, and he obtained a subscription the very first day. (208) In Nicaragua reading the special issue showed an. “Awake!” subscriber that she also must be a publisher, she at once asking for help. (219) Yes, the special-issue campaign not only placed millions of additional copies of “The Watchtower” but it also “set many on the way to life,” as the report from Britain expresses it in telling of a whole family’s coming in the truth because of it. (100)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to these experiences, local experiences will also be given. The speaker should check in advance with witnesses to find good experiences so as to have them present to relate them, either outstanding ones from the 1956 campaign with the special issue or recent ones while in magazine activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Discourse on “Great April Increase Anticipated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the slogan at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Regularity in Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The yeartext stresses telling the good news of salvation “from day to day.” This brings up another of our seven goals for 1957: Regularity in service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Of even the silent heavens the psalmist said that “day unto day” and “night unto night” they declare the glory of God. Are you as regular as they are, or are you more spasmodic, like an earthquake or tidal wave that might come only occasionally? Would you go a week or a month without praising Jehovah, or is daily service vital to you? Of course, the true Christian must take service seriously.—Ps. 19:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Through preaching we prove we are witnesses. But Satan puts many obstacles, materialistic and otherwise, in our way. So we must be reminded from time to time of where we stand and be helped to improve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s organization has arranged just such a protective reminder for us. On the 1st and 15th of each month the study conductor receives a list of those who need assistance. So if we have slipped in our regular praising of Jehovah he can give us the help and aid we need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Obviously, this is for our good, so the servants should be able to discuss our regularity frankly with us. Really, they are harming us if they do not do so. They want to help, and we should appreciate that aid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> But not every assistant congregation servant provides this list twice each month, and not all study conductors meet their responsibility to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Theocratic Aid” in Greek</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font12"> is now available in the Greek language. Greek-speaking brothers may wish to have this publication </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12"> study. It may be ordered through the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications Now Available</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font12"> (2d Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">—Bicolano, Ga</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Extra Campaign Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some congregations sent in special orders for the four-month </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign. These extra magazines were added to the regular distributors’ quantity sent. Orders marked “for the campaign only” will not be decreased automatically for the May issues. Since it is difficult to determine magazine needs that far in advance it is suggested that congregations send in another magazine distributors’ order blank by April 1 to show the quantities desired after the campaign.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">aid those needing assistance. Those who do not are falling down on their job. But they must not fall down on it, because even our very lives may depend upon such help!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Of course, the study Conductors cannot do all this by themselves and they may get aid from other mature brothers. Actually, everyone should be working toward having 100-per-cent regularity in service every month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Sixty-five percent of all publishers now are regular. That is, they witness every month. As a result they are the happiest of publishers, they are discharging their responsibility, they are finding the service easier to do, they are accomplishing more and they feel better about it. Are you one of them ? Form the good habit of regular service. Be like David, who said: “My tongue shall talk of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.”—Ps. 35; 28;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Remember, too, midweek activity. Midweek contacts are especially helpful to sisters who have opposing husbands. Many others can increase service through this means. In Venezuela, where midweek service has been pushed both mornings and afternoons, the average in hours now is from 12 to 15. Can your congregation likewise improve in this manner?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Whenever you look at the yeartext in your Kingdom Hall, remember that “from day to day” means regularity in service, and let it remind you that each publisher must do all possible to reach that goal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Special Magazines Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The special April 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and the special April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">should be ordered now, one order serving for both the congregation and the pioneers. For quotas see article “Great April Increase Anticipated.” Be sure to order enough magazines. Last year many congregations ran short. An order blank is enclosed with this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> It should be back in the office as soon as possible and no later than March 11.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Work with the Circuit Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Reports show that although provision is made for circuit servants to aid at least thirty-one different publishers during their visit, an average of only about fifteen co-operate with them. Why? Is it due to a lack of proper planning, to pride or to a failure to appreciate the vital need to “thoroughly accomplish your ministry”?—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus preached from city to city “the twelve were with him.” Yes, they not only accompanied Jesus when he preached in their own territory but continued with him, getting valuable training. No wonder that afterward their enemies had to take note that these apostles “used to be with Jesus” because of the way they preached.—Luke 8:1; Acts 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We are not asked to accompany the circuit servant from congregation to congregation, but only when he visits our own. Surely housewives can arrange their schedules and mothers can co-operate with one another so that all can get to benefit from working with the circuit servant. If you have secular work why not tell your employer that your obligations as a minister require you to be away for a day, or at least a half a day, during the circuit servant’s visit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do we fail to co-operate because of pride? Dare we make our pride more important than the everlasting life of men of good will? James reminds us that God gives undeserved kindness only to the humble ones. And Solomon tells us that the “reproofs of instruction are the way of life,” but “the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.” And the circuit servant will help you not only by counseling you on your presentation but by letting you observe his presentation.—Prov. 6:23; 1:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Reports also show that co-operation with the circuit servant is especially weak in the afternoons. Pioneers in particular should be able to work with him in the afternoon back-call and home Bible study work. And how about school children?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Plan and work on this matter right now. Then when the schedule is made up for the circuit servant’s visit you should put these plans into effect so that you will be able to work with him. For schedule details, congregation servants please see the March, 1956, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ways of Introducing Sermon on God’s Name</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Getting off to a good start at the door is often the difference between giving or not giving the sermon. Therefore, knowing what to say and how to say it is most important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> First, fix a variety of introductions in mind, memorize them if necessary. Then Vary your introductions at the doors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Here are a few ways the sermon on God’s name may be introduced. “Good morning. My companion and I are calling on people who pray the Lord’s prayer. You, no doubt, are acquainted with how it goes, ‘Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.’ But just what is God’s name?” Proceed with your sermon. Or say, “I am a student of the Bible, bringing information vital to my neighbors. For years people have prayed ‘Hallowed . . .’” etc. Or you might say, “I am working with a society of ministers, encouraging the people to read and study so that they can get more out of their Bibles. For example, for years people have prayed, ‘Our Father . .’ ” Develop your sermon. Keep your approach new and different. Keep your presentations alive. It will make your ministry more pleasant and effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If you are new in a neighborhood say, “I am a minister new in the neighborhood calling by to get acquainted with you. You doubtless have prayed the Lord’s prayer, ‘Our Father . . .’ ” If in a religious neighborhood say, “I am calling on people who are interested in putting God</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">April Increase &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Surely the special Memorial activity will aid in this. Memorial comes on Sunday the 14th. There will be no public talk that day. Instead, the new series will start the following week. Thus everyone should have a good day in field service, then after 6 p.m. assemble to celebrate the Memorial.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study will be held first, that the Memorial may make the final impression upon us that day. If two congregations meet in the same hall, and if the hall is not large enough to accommodate both groups at the same service, one congregation may wish to hold its </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study on Saturday night.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">first in their lives. All of us would like to know more about God. How often have we prayed, ‘Hallowed be thy name,’ but do you know what his name is?” Or begin, “I am calling by to strengthen faith in God. We can all use more faith. We pray for it, but to whom do we pray? We say, ‘Our Father . . &nbsp;” Or simply say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“My name is --- ---. No doubt</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">you are concerned with the critieal-ness of our times and have prayed for peace and better conditions. But to whom have we prayed? To God, we say. But to what god? Paul says there are many lords and many gods.” Read 1 Corinthians 8:5, 6, and continue from there.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Some have had good success saying, “My companion and I have come to talk with you about the most important name in the universe. Have you any idea as to what it is? It isn’t a man’s name. Jesus in prayer said, ‘Hallowed be thy name.’ What is this name?” and so on.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Work at becoming proficient in the business of preaching. Let all know that we are servants of the great Kings, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.—Prov. 22: 29.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The brother who gives the Memorial talk should be of the anointed, if capable and qualified, otherwise of the other sheep. The circuit servant probably will give the Memorial talk at nearly all the congregations he serves during Memorial week. On Saturday night he will give his regular Saturday talk, then follow it with his final admonition to the congregation. On Sunday he will not give a public talk, but the congregation will follow the same schedule outlined above, namely, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">study, then Memorial.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> With everyone taking an enthusiastic part in vigorous planting and thorough watering, April will see a healthy and impressive increase.</span></p></li></ul>

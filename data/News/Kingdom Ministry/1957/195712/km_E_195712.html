<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>A</span><span class="font0"> Harvest for Willing Workers</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Goals Set: 10-Percent Increase in Publishers Two Thirds of the Publishers Conducting Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> How much time for the final ingathering? The “other sheep” must be gathered to the “one flock” before Armageddon strikes. Jehovah’s question was, not, “How long?” but, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Who, today, is willing to expend himself a little more than usual for Jehovah’s lifesaving work? Who, today, is willing to sacrifice a little more of his free time to get into the field to search out the lost sheep? Who, today, is willing to set aside personal ambitions and pleasures, luxuries and friends to answer the call to the field ? Who ? Are you willing? “Your people will offer themselves willingly,” said King David prophetically. Are you willing to offer yourself? Jehovah said his people would be.—John 10:16; Isa. 6: 8, AS; Ps. 110: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> For years now Jehovah has had in operation his theocratic organization. He has been training and instructing men and women who have devoted themselves willingly for this very work. They have been assigned territory in the field. Now they must not permit their attention to be drawn away. Not for one instant must they let anything Interrupt the onward push.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> So the command is, not to halt, but to push ahead! We have a 10-percent-increase goal to reach by the end of December. Will your congregation reach it? Shall we in America make it? We shall, if we all offer ourselves willingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> The 10-percent goal is easily within our reach. Why? Because last April there were 208,260 publishers in the field, and we need only 206,538 publishers to make our 10-percent quota for the United States. So if servants and mature publishers are willing to aid the weak during December, then -we have every reason to believe that the report will be “We Made It!” (All congregations who reach the quota should report on their card “We Made It!”) Beware of overconfidence, however, for last December was the first time that we in America made the 10-percent increase. Therefore, leave no stone unturned; take nothing for granted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The question remains, Are we willing? Jehovah said his people would be. Are you? Today the Lord’s servants are busily engaged in proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom from house to house, aiding newer and weaker ones to do the same. Are you? Jehovah’s zealous people are not devoting their time and money building expensive homes in which to live in grand style and entertain friends with worldly pleasure. Are you? They are searching for the “other sheep,” wherever they can be found. And after they find</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">; OFFER FOR DECEMBER J Any bound book and a booklet for &lt;&nbsp;50c, or Vol. I (NW), a book and a booklet for $1.50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR DECEMBER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tell the Good News from Day to Day '</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Ps. 96:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">one of them, they do as the Master told his disciple: “Feed my little sheep.” Do you hunt and feed the sheep? Repeated visits are made on these, and home Bible studies are conducted with them, to the end that they may learn the good purposes of Jehovah, take their stand on his side and then join in the gathering work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">—John 21:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Publishers Conducting Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> This brings up our second goal; that is, two thirds of the publishers conducting home Bible studies by the end of December. Will your congregation meet this goal? It can if the publishers offer themselves willingly. If all servants and mature publishers conduct at least one home Bible study, as they should be doing; and if these help others in the congregation to share in the Bible study work, as they should; then that goal will be reached with ease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Have in mind that Christianity means helping others to gain life through accurate knowledge. Let us, then, have as our slogan: “Each one help one.” Help not only one, but as many as will “take life’s waters free.” This means we must have a right mental attitude toward Bible studies. A circuit servant reported that starting home Bible studies the same day the placements were made proved very successful. “The literature is left in the morning and then the publisher returns in the afternoon. Others were started the next day or several days later. Then, too, the brothers have expressed keen delight and enjoyment in this fine method,” he said. Why not try it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> December, with its “Christmas” holiday, offers a grand opportunity for a greater witness. Last year 400,000 extra magazines were ordered and used in “Christmas” holiday witnessing. This is an exceptionally fine report. Prepare to do as well this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> For your regular presentation prepare well the sermon outlined in the October </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> and use it to place the offer. Those who wish to use Volume I of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> along with a bound book may find the sermon contained in the November, 1954, “Presenting the Good News” very helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> So keep busy; </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">push ahead</span><span class="font8"> ! Reports coming from various parts of the world prove that the work is expanding and that thousands of sheep are hearing the message and are coming to the only place of safety.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING TN DECEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Tell the Good News from Day to Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Talk on “Tell the Good News from Day to Day.” (See “Watchtower,” 12/1/57, p. 719, and 12/15/56, p. 744.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Questlon-and-answer coverage of the main article “A Harvest for Willing Workers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">22 min: Demonstration on “Encourage Persons Studied with to Become Kingdom Ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Discuss twofold purpose of conducting Bible studies: (1) to aid persons to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth,” and (2) to aid them to become teachers of the good news. Some persons have studied for many months, but “in view of the time” are not teachers. What can be done to help them?—1 Tim. 2: 4; Heb. 5: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (3 min.) A soliloquy. Bible study servant is examining study slips showing persons with whom studies have been conducted for a long time. One study has been conducted for nearly a year; “Let God Be True” has been completed and study is well along in “This Means Everlasting Life”. Still the person has not become a Kingdom minister. Bible study servant mulls on matter, wondering what might be holding back persons like this. As it is his responsibility, he plans to go to publisher and help in starting the new one as a Kingdom praiser in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (4 mln.) Servant contacts publisher. They discuss good-will person’s knowledge. Publisher is pleased with present state of knowledge. Bible study servant asks whether publisher has invited good-will person to share in the ministry. Publisher says yes, but person did not respond to casual invitations; publisher continued the study, waiting for the time when the truth will move the person to share in the service. Bible study servant explains that all need encouragement to begin service, and that publisher can explain to potential new witness how he can share: with handbills, by reading a scripture and by sharing in house-to-house magazine service. Publisher sees wisdom of this, but is somewhat hesitant. Bible study servant offers to go along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE Til (8 min.) At end of study Bible study servant comments on a scripture relating to service, perhaps one covered in the study, Tactfully he shows how all should share knowledge with others. He tells of many new ones going in service this month and invites good-will person to share in some feature of Kingdom ministry. Good-will person knows he should and plans to “sometime.” Bible study servant suggests that the “sometime” be the coming week. Definite arrangements are made. In answer to question, “But what shall I say?” servant explains that after a few doors he can give invitations to the public meeting. Later new one may read a scripture and comment on it. House-to-house magazine work is mentioned as simple. Publisher is asked to demonstrate a magazine presentation. Householder feels he can do that and tries. He is commended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Do not hesitate to invite persons who have studied for a number of months to share in field service. New ones may report time if they say something at the door and share in the witness. Encourage publishers to analyze the conducting of their studies: Are they encouraging persons studied with to become Kingdom ministers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on “ ‘Awake’’ Results” and text [Matt. 5:16] at bottom of page one.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7 min: Talk on “Vacation Pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “How Magazine-conscious Are You?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">13 min: Report from the magazineterritory servant, in conjunction with “Congregation Organization” article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: A talk stressing the people’s need for the magazines and showing how this need is being met by Kingdom ministers. Select high points from current articles; prove that the people need this information. Show how worldly magazines are not meeting the people’s need; mass of magazines on newsstands brightly colored on outside but inside are devoid of spiritual nourishment. So when people say they have “too many” magazines already, it is no reason for not taking “Watchtower” and “Awake!” Use “Yearbook” experiences to underscore and illustrate points made in the talk, such as the different ways Kingdom ministers meet the people’s need for the magazines. Are any overlooking opportunities magazine routes present? A publisher in Montserrat has one in a police station! (200) One missionary placed 4,000 magazines in one year. (212) Incidental witnessing offers opportunities to meet people’s need as one publisher in Nicaragua has experienced. (219) Result of a back-call on a “Watchtower” placement in Austria: woman with whom magazine was placed is now a publisher. (85) Similar experience had by a publisher in Finland. (143)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include a brisk New World News report.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Audience participation on “How New Publishers Can Be Aided to Share in December Activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Show how important it is to “tell the good news from day to day.” To help new ones share the good news with others we ourselves must first appreciate the importance Scripturally of helping new ones to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (16 min.) This program has been divided into four main points. These will form the basis of the discussion, the audience having four minutes on each point to make comments and offer suggestions. To make certain that the program will be of practical value, as well as spiritually edifying, the chairman may ask certain publishers to come prepared with a comment on a specific point. Comments should be brief and “hit the nail on the head,” as it were, thus allowing for a number of brothers to comment on a single point. Following are the four points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. The importance Scripturally of helping new ones to preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. How to aid good-will persons being studied with to see the importance of joining in the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. How publishers can help good-will persons overcome common problems that they have raised, thereby opening the door to service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. The ways in which new publishers can share in giving a witness. (Such as: Use of handbills, tracts to interested persons, magazine activity, reading a Scripture in the sermon and commenting on it and incidental witnessing.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Put to use the suggestions so new publishers can be aided to share in December activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Hearing Results of Persons Being Studied with Aided in Service —a program of experiences conducted by the Bible study servant. He may interview a few publishers who have had results in aiding good-will persons into the service. Call for other experiences from the audience; Show the results of applying the counsel given in program two weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk on “Instructions to Ministers in Bible Times.” Jehovah’s organization provides instructions to help Kingdom ministers. Many kinds of service instructions in Bible times. Do we realize how many instructions Christ Jesus issued? He gave instructions to the twelve and to the seventy. (Matt. 10: 5-42; Luke 10: 1-16) Do not read all the verses but select and discuss some of the interesting instructions, especially those that are most apt today. Other instructions dealt with the magnitude of the preaching work. (Matt. 28:19 20; Acts 1:8) Many apostolic instructions. (2 Tim. 2: 23-26; 4: 2; Titus </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font7"> 1-10; Col. 4: 5, 6) The great service instruction, issued in Bible times, but to be carried out in this “time of the end.”—Matt. 24: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on “The Grand Event of 1958.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 mln: Cover “Make Sure of AU Things”, on Love, pages 250 and 251 to 1 Pet. 4:8. To be handled by question and answers, audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration of points by the school servant. Highlight illustrations and examples that can be used to advantage locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 mln: Service talk pertaining to local congregational problems and needs. Additional points: Encourage more publishers to enjoy Bible study activity; all publishers be in the service this month; use the-last full weekend remaining in month to help those needing assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Rom. 7:4] at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant Consults with Magazine-Territory Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The congregation servant is appointed as overseer because he is considered the one most qualified in every way to look after the interests of the congregation. However, he cannot do all the work himself and so he has a number of assistants who look after the various features of the congregation’s activities. By taking a keen interest in each of the servants this overseer can build up an organization in which each assistant does the work properly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> To help realize that ideal situation is the purpose of having the congregation servant check each month with one of his assistants. In doing so we have application of the Scriptural principles that “two are better than one” and that none can say to the other: “I have no need of you.”—Eccl. 4: 9; 1 Cor. 12: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Both servants, of course, should review the duties of the magazineterritory servant as outlined in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font8"> and in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font8"> in preparation for their visit together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Among the points that these two servants are to discuss together are: (1) The records. (2) The territory</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Grand Event of 1958</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is that grand event? Surely everyone in the New World society knows that it is the international assembly in New York city. Do you intend to be there? Are you making plans now so that assembly time will not find you still at home? Now is the time to think about it and to put your plans for it with things of foremost importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Set your heart on attending and then diligently seek a way to get there. Think, plan and work for a way to open up for you. Talk with other publishers about their plans. Learn how they are arranging to finance the trip. Perhaps car groups can be worked out. Keep the assembly in your prayers during 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for “Watchtower” Campaign!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From January to April inclusive we shall present the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">subscription and three booklets for $1. Look ahead to this campaign and prepare for it. Enclosed is a Magazine Distributor’s Order form, for use of the congregations to increase their supply of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> to meet needs for the campaign.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">coverage with literature and magazines and problems in regard to coverage. (See July, August, 1956, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span><span class="font8"> (3) The ordering of sufficient magazines and their distribution to congregation publishers and pioneers. (4) The handling of magazine money and the requesting of credit for magazines obtained by pioneers. (5) How to improve and get greater support for Magazine Day activity as well as prestudy magazine service. (6) How he can take the lead and help more individuals and groups to share regularly in magazine work and individually meet the quota. (7) His personal field work and taking the lead, and how such can be improved. (8) His work with the service center as conductor, or where directed to work by the congregation servant. (9) Congregation problems and how they affect him and his duties. (10) How co-operation can be improved and work co-ordinated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> As we read at Proverbs 20:18: “By counsel plans themselves are firmly established”; and so by the counsel that the overseer or congregation servant will be able to give to the magazine-territory servant, his plans can be firmly established on a Scriptural and practical basis.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Protest to Ethiopia</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aicafce! of October 8, 1957, carried an article on the recent banning of the work in Ethiopia. The brothers were urged to write the emperor of Ethiopia protesting this and registering surprise at the action that was taken against the ministerial representatives of the Society in that country. We should like the brothers to give this full support. It would be proper to refer to that issue and protest against this encroachment on freedom of worship. If the brothers have business letterheads or personal stationery, it would be good to use that. We suggest that the congregation servant in large congregations select three brothers to write these letters. In smaller congregations, if at least one writes it will be good. However, all are free to share in writing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How Magazine-conscious Are You?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Regarding the publishers’ magazine placements in the United States, the Society may well quote Paul’s words at 1 Thessalonians 4:10: “In fact, you are doing it . . . But we exhort you, brothers, to go on doing it in fuller measure.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Thus in June, 1955, congregation publishers were averaging 6.5 magazines monthly, pioneers 49.5 and special pioneers 61.9. But during 1957 the congregation publishers averaged 12.4 magazines, almost twice as many; pioneers averaged 99.8 and special pioneers 135.6, both more than doubling their magazine placements in two years. In 1955, in the United States alone, we placed just a little more than 18 million magazines, but in 1957 almost 36 million. It is no wonder Brother Knorr said that the Society was very much pleased with the excellent magazine work done and that we should continue to stress it!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Let all, therefore, continue to support the magazine activity zealously. Do so on Magazine Day, in going from store to store and from house to house and in the street work; do so in the prestudy evening work and on Sundays by offering the two magazines, if the householder does not accept the regular offer. And especially in December we should all be magazine-conscious, because of the opportunity that the holiday presents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Schedule your affairs so that magazines will not pile up at your home. If for any reason you have a few left after the next issue comes out, offer one with the current magazine until they are used up. And, of course, we do not want to have magazines piling up at the Kingdom Hall, either. Therefore, let each one regularly take the number of magazines he stipulated he would and upon which the magazine-territory servant based his order from the Society. By watching these points our magazine activity for 1958 can be even better than it was for 1957!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Awake!” Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have cause for rejoicing despite the flu during the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> campaign. More people than ever before are still having </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> come into their homes to open their minds to the life-giving truths of God’s Word. Because of the good effort put forth by all 149,603 new subscriptions were obtained, which is a decrease of 18,683 subscriptions under that of last year. But it is still a good report.</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_195712_files/km_E_195712-3.png" alt="" style="width:279pt;height:47pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Simplicity and Practical Application</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus preached he did not use the language of the scholars and philosophers of his day. He spoke the language of the common people, using expressions familiar to them. Because he used simplicity of speech he could be understood by all. Our speech at the doors should have the same simplicity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Simplicity means clearness, unaffectedness and freedom from complexity. If you speak with simplicity you will not use theocratic terms in your sermons without proper explanation. Terms such as remnant, theocracy, Armageddon, great multitude, goats, other sheep, Jonadabs and so forth have no meaning to outsiders unless an explanation is given. If you use the term “battle of Armageddon,” qualify it by saying, “that is, when God will destroy this present wicked world or system of things.” Make sure each statement is understood before you make another one; then you will be speaking with simplicity. “Unless you through the tongue utter speech easily understood, how will it be known what is being spoken?” (1 Cor. 14:9) It takes a conscious effort to express oneself in terms that people can understand. That means we must be sensitive to the words and terms we use at the door, making sure they are clear to the householder. We should also have simplicity in our theme. It should be a simple point, which is clear, logical and easily grasped.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> When Jesus preached he made frequent use of illustrations. “Then he told them many things by illustrations.” (Matt. 13:3) He told about the sower that went out to sow seed; about the Kingdom being like a mustard grain, like yeast in dough and like a dragnet. He told many other things that were common to the people’s experience. Uis simple and direct illustrations helped to impress on the minds of the people the truths he preached. We can make the same good use of illustrations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Since people are generally interested in themselves, you will need to point out how the subject you are speaking about affects them and how they can benefit. If you are speaking about new-world blessings, ask If they would like to live in a world where they and their children would never be sick. Then explain how they can. To people living in large cities it might be pointed out that it is unsafe to be on the streets at night, but under the rule of God’s kingdom there will be no danger. There may be some local condition troubling a community that will lend itself well for making practical application of your sermon. Be alert in applying such things.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> When Jesus spoke the people listened “with pleasure,” not only because he spoke the truth but also because he spoke in a way they could understand. He used simplicity of speech with good illustrations, making practical application of what he said. Let us follow his example and improve the effectiveness of our sermons.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Since summer vacations are well in the past, does that mean vacation pioneering should be dismissed from mind? Not at all! This fine provision for tasting the joys of full-time service can be used at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Many school children receive a two-week Christmas vacation. Why not pioneer during this period? While the children of the old world sing the carols of false religion, you theocratic children can be happily singing, every day, sweet songs of praise to Jehovah God by making public declaration to his name and purposes. “Give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name, make known among the peoples his dealings. Sing to him, triqke melody to him, voice your interest in all his wonderful works.”—Ps. 105:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Those who pioneered during the summer well know the joys that pioneering brings, as well as the manner in which it matures a person in the truth. They recommend it and</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">will certainly be among the first to apply for vacation pioneering during December. Here is what one of these summer pioneers says: “I didn’t understand what service really meant until I vacation pioneered. ... I personally recommend that all teenagers pioneer. ... I know they could receive the same blessings and happiness I have received.” Try it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Adult publishers may also vacation pioneer whenever they are able. Some farmers may find they can do this during the winter months, when their work has slacked off. An excellent idea is to vacation pioneer when the circuit servant makes his visit and profit from his daily counsel. Think seriously about vacation pioneering. Do not miss the joy and satisfaction it brings. Let it be a forward step toward regular pioneering. “I -will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.”—Ps. 34:1.</span></p>

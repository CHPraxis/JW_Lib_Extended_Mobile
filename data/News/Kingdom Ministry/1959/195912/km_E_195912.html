<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Alert to Start Home Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> If we would save ourselves and tho.se who listen to us, what must we do? Stay watchfully by the right things, such as proper Christian conduct, prayer, study, meeting attendance and sharing in all features of the Kingdom ministry.—1 Tim. 4 :16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During December this means continuing with the current literature offer of two bound books and two booklets. Presenting it at every door, even if unable to give the sermon, has proved very fruitful. Where the full offer is rejected, try placing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book. In one instance five copies were placed on a call. The householder took three (two for his grandchildren), a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">neighbor who </span><span class="font11">happened to drop in took one although a Catholic, and so did another’ neighbor who happened to call on the phone and whom the householder invited over to see the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One of our main goals for December is for each one to have at least one home Bible study. New and older publishers find it easy to start studies in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book. If we already have a study, why not help another who does not, or maybe we have time to conduct two or more Bible studies a week? We are doing very well as a whole, for September showed 199,919 studies being-conducted in the United States. Compared with September, 1958, this means that, on an average, we have increased over ninety new Bible studies every day during the past service year! If we keep up that rate of increase we shall have over 232,000 studies by next September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How about our 10-percent increase? Many new ones have started in the past year; let us help them develop the good habit of regularity. If some, like those at Ephesus, have let their first love cooi off, help them to rekindle it. (Rev. 2:4) Some publishers have obligations that make it difficult for them to be at the regular contact points </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font11"> field service. Provision should also be made for them at other convenient times. Each week the assistant congregation servant will provide study conductors with a list of those not out so special help can be given to them. Let every publisher try to be in the service and report by December 6. Then what about those with whom we are studying? The more</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth” and “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,” with two booklets, for $1.25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher on Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Teaching on Bible studies begins with preparation. Prepare well yourself, anticipating questions that might come to the good-will person’s mind. Make certain the lesson is clear in your own mind; otherwise, how will it become clear<sup>-</sup> in the householder’s mind? Show the householder how to prepare. Prepare a few paragraphs with him, underlining the key words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Be a teacher in your opening and closing prayers. Include thoughts that will help the householder. If a householder tends to be argumentative, the publisher, in prayer, could ask God that we be humble, teachable and reasonable. By keeping in mind the objective of the study—dedication and training for the ministry—prayer can also include thoughts on the need to teach others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Be a teacher. Do not let the study turn into a social call. Be friendly, but keep your teachingpurpose in mind. After prayer, begin service-minded we are, remember, the sooner they will be ready also to say, “Come 1” Give a definite invitation to persons studied with to join with you. Often they only await your invitation to commence field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Finally, not to be overlooked is our magazine activity. December 25 is an excellent day for it. Invite new ones to be out with you. Let it be an all-out congregational effort. Show we are not slaves to tradition I Many get extra blessings by devoting both morning and afternoon to it. You youthful publishers, think what opportunities for sharing in this service your school vacations give you I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'■ In all such ways we shall be staying watchfully by the right things, thereby saving both ourselves and those who listen to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">with a review. Do not merely ask: “Do you remember what we studied last week?” Have definite, well-planned questions on high points of the past lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Be a teacher by making certain the good-will person is really learning, that he is understanding the lesson. If a student recites an answer word for word from the book, commend him, but then kindly help him answer in his own words. Break down the question. Use auxiliary questions to ensure understanding. If the student is not prepared, do not simply read the paragraphs first. You might say: “Then we will prepare the study together.” Let the publisher guard against talking too much, thinking that the explain-it-for-them way is teaching. If the publisher is really teaching, the student should do most of the talking, answering the questions, looking up and reading scriptures and applying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Staying Watchfully by the Right Things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 mih: Talk on theme for the month* “Staying Watchfully by the Right Things.” (See “Watchtower,” January 1, 1959, p. 5, and December 1, 1959, p. 735.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the article “Stay Watchfully by the Right Things!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">24</span><span class="font10"> min. Demonstration on “What We Can Do to Reach the 10-Percent Goal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Talk by congregation servant. Goal of 10-percent increase in congregation requires co-operation of all. Not most interested in peak figure on chart, but we seek more praisers of Jehovah to his glory. A11 with knowledge have divine command to preach. Lives are at stake—the lives of those in darkness and our own. We must keep clean from the blood of all men by teaching those in darkness. Being busy in Jehovah’s service helps us build up faith, maintain integrity and stay within confines of New World society. All need proper appreciation of reasons for engaging in field service. Who will help us reach the goal?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Congregation servant talks to assistant congregation servant and asks him what his part is in reaching goal. Replies he will give all study conductors list of those not reporting in November, also will advise them of all others who are irregular publishers so they may be aided in December. Explains that these are persons who have shown desire to serve Jehovah but who, in many instances, are confronted with obstacles and will no doubt appreciate the loving assistance of their brothers. Overseer asks assistant to show audience what will be done. Assistant calls study conductor to platform and hands him prepared list for his study group. Instructs conductor to give special attention to ones who have problems that make it difficult for them to engage in service, to find out when it is possible for them to share in service if they cannot be at the regular contacts for field service, and to endeavor to arrange for them to work with other publishers when they can go. He tells conductor that he will check with him each week to see which ones are not yet out and what is being done to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Overseer next talks to study conductor and asks what he will do with list. Conductor states that he has in mind those in his group he will aid and has assigned others to be aided by certain mature brothers and sisters in the service center. He will illustrate how this will be done. Calls mature sister to platform and asks if she will help one sister who was not out last month and another who, though in service in November, has been irregular in the last few months. Sister happy to be of aid. Conductor suggests different times when irregular publisher may be free, and sister is willing to arrange her affairs to help her during those times. Definite time will be scheduled to aid. Conductor will check during month to see progress being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Overseer notes that present publishers are to be properly aided, but what about starting new ones? Asks Bible study servant what he will do to help reach 10-percent increase. Has determined what studies have been conducted for last six months and, if those being studied with are not publishing, he will suggest that the one conducting study follow the suggestions given in “The Watchtower,” 1958, page 541, par. 20, to prepare them for service and endeavor to make definite arrangements to take them along in service during December. Bible study servant will check with many himself and will ask book study conductors to help him contact other publishers. Calls publisher to platform to demonstrate what he will suggest for inviting persons of good will to publish, in line with the foregoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Overseer asks for comments from publishers on their willingness to follow through on program and their determination to be in the service themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Overseer concludes with admonition to all to share in field service in December and to aid others, new and irregular, so goal may be reached to the greater praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on 1 Timothy 6: 2, at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min; New World News and Announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Yearbook” experiences on starting home Bible studies. Present as a talk. Introduction can point out that Bible studies are most effective way to teach people the truth. Can be started when effort is made to do so, even on the first call, as was done in Argentina and in Puerto Rico. (87, 242, 243) Sometimes a study can be started with good results when initial interest is only slight. (108) Even when the Society’s literature is not accepted a study can still be started in some instances. (153) Conclude by encouraging audience to try the methods for starting studies that have been suggested by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Demonstration on “More to Conduct Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Many books placed last month and many more will be this month. Each placement a potential home Bible study. Many publishers have all the studies they can care for now; others have none. All want to see as many as possible learning the truth. What can be done to aid publishers not conducting studies to share in home Bible study service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) At Kingdom Hall Bible study servant approaches Brother Successful, inquires on progress in book campaign. Successful happily relates he has placed six and started two studies, which gives him a total of three studies. One was started on initial call; now whole family joins in study, have come to Kingdom Hall and are progressing very well. Rapid progress attributed to fact that interest has. remained high from first; never had chance to cool, since study started immediately. He could start another study now, and would like to continue trying to start them on initial calls, but has no time to conduct more. Servant observes that not all have done so well, suggests Successful turn over some calls to others. Successful is willing, but fears studies will quit if change is attempted. Servant points out that if another person is taken along for a few studies to get acquainted and gain confidence, no difficulty should be encountered. He has in mind having Successful take Brother Abie along on back-calls or even door-to-door calls and letting him take over studies they are able to start. Successful happily consents. Servant asks Successful to wait while he talks to Brother Able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Servant walks over to Able, converses about Bible studies. Able places literature, but has not been able to start studies. Discussion follows on starting study on initial call. Servant emphasizes value of this method. Able has not really tried it, has heard of good results, would like study and to see how others start study on initial call. Servant invites Able to work with Successful and to take over a study the two start while working together. Able readily agrees. Successful is called over, and arrangements are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Successful and Able at door. Sermon just completed by Able, householder accepts offer. Successful proceeds as outlined in June “Kingdom Ministry” (1st meeting), study is started. Chairman interrupts, <sub>v</sub> explains that study continues for a few paragraphs, then note what happens: Successful asks a few simple questions to review and highlight points learned, and comments on value received. Able previews coming pages at Successful’s request, suggests that discussion be continued following week. Householder agrees; definite time set; Able -will return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) All should share in home Bible study work. Bible study servant will endeavor tc-implement this; study conductors can help publishers in their service center start and distribute studies. Individual publishers may request or offer help. All co-operate to expand home Bible study work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on 2 Timothy 2:2, at the bottom c: page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Talk on “Witnessing Through Correspondence.” An experience or witnessing by correspondence can be found on page 267 of “Yearbook.” Include points on incidental witnessing. Experiences can be found on pages 110, 256, 127 and 233.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Demonstrate publisher making back-call, giving Paradise back-call sermon and starting study. Us-five minutes of this time for experiences publishers have had starting studies by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration and discussion of “Presenting the Good News&quot; and talk on “Recommend Yourself by Kindness.” (To be conducted by school servant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Report from Magazine-Territory Servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Questions and answers on “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Talk and demonstration on “Be a Teacher on Bible Studies.” (Bible study servant to give talk on article, demonstrating points.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregations having a fifth service meeting will prepare their own program. It may be built around the weaknesses shown on the last circuit servant’s report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION ORGANIZATION</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It should be the desire of all publishers to have one Or more Bible studies each week. Once started, every effort should be made to hold the study regularly and weekly, if possible. It is when the person of good will receives accurate knowledge from Jehovah’s Word frequently that progress will be made. A study report should be turned in for each study conducted during the month, even though circumstances in some instances may not permit conducting it more than once during the month. But when shall we start counting a study when it is started on the initial call or on a back-call?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If a study is started on the first contact where literature is placed, or on the first back-call, the Bible study is not to be reported until two study meetings are held after the initial study and with arrangements being made to continue the study beyond this third occasion. In other<sup>-</sup>words, you would not make out a report on a Bible study just started until the study had been conducted two more times and arrangements had been made after this for the study to continue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In reporting a Bible study it should always be remembered that a back-call should be counted every time the study is conducted. Why? Because a Bible study is a back-call. It is the essence of the back-call work. Hence, you should count each</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">January through April the offer will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and three booklets, for $1. Congregations should ascertain their increased magazine needs for the campaign and submit a Magazine Distributor’s Order right away. </span><span class="font11">call you make to conduct a study as a back-call on your field service report.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">■4&gt; Orders may be placed starting December 10 for the 1959 bound volumes of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> It will be appreciated if publishers and pioneers order through the congregation with other literature.

<p><span class="font10">♦ When congregation book study groups complete studying “Your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font10"> they should start studying it all over again. Much will be gained from a second coverage of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Some have felt that reporting the Bible study on the field service report is sufficient. Space is provided on the field report for showing the number of Bible studies conducted each week as an aid in reporting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">weekly</span><span class="font11"> activity. However, on the report for the month the congregation counts only the number of Bible studies conducted as reflected by the number of Study Reports turned in at the end of the month. Cultivate the good habit of turning in your Bible Study Reports with your last field service report at the end of the month. Circuit servants and congregation servants, in reporting to the Society, often express the fact that more Bible studies were conducted during a month but some publishers failed to report their studies. Let us be conscious of this and respond to the reminders we receive from time to time to report Bible studies and other field activity promptly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">&quot; While reporting our Bible studies is incidental to our loving service rendered to Jehovah and in behalf of persons of good will, it, nevertheless, should be done with care so that an accurate report can be tabulated and that we may know how we are doing in feeding the Lord’s “other sheep.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing Through Correspondence</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Not all Kingdom ministers are physically able to go from house to house. Yet they want to share in the service during December—yes, every month. What can they do, especially when they are shut-ins? Often they can witness to persons who come to their house, such as salesmen. There is another way : witnessing through correspondence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Though other brothers may also write to relatives and friends at certain times, witnessing through correspondence as a general and continuous practice should be used especially by those not able to go from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Certain principles governing speaking likewise apply to letter writing. Be “tactful toward all.” Be kind in language. Use correct postage When mailing out literature. How disconcerting it is to a householder to receive an envelope with a postage-due stamp. To the householder it is vexatious enough to have to pay postage on something he ordered. How will he feel, then, to get a postage-due stamp on material he has not ordered? Be certain to use correct postage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> By being tactful and kind and by following certain principles, such as neatness, mentioned in Lesson 36 of the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qunlifirul to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font11"> this form of witnessing can be made productive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Teacher on Bible Studies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">them. Give instruction on how to use the Bible. Consider unquoted scriptures. Teach the good-will person by being sure he understands the scripture and how it supports the thought brought out by the book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Be a teacher of the entire family by encouraging all to share in the study if possible. Men are often neglected. See that all present have a book or can look on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Be a teacher by teaching the good-will person to teach others. At the close of the study have a closed-book review. Be ready with prepared questions on vital points covered by the lesson. Some of the questions should be framed to aid the student to think in terms of teaching others. A question might be: “If your neighbor came over and said: ‘Some day this earth will be destroyed,’ what would you tell her?” Before closing with prayer, whet the student’s spiritual appetite by raising questions that will be answered next week. Be a teacher on Bible studies, and the householder will be equipped to teach others.—2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Holiday Season</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Christmas-New Year season offers Jehovah’s witnesses many opportunities for preaching. Almost all have time off from secular work. Also, people usually are in a more thoughtful, Bible-receptive mood, with the feeling that good will should be expressed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> With these thoughts in mind, one might make this approach: “The purpose of my call is to promote better understanding among people of all kinds. At this season most people are thinking about good will and hospitality to one another. It would be good if everybody would do this 365 days a year, wouldn’t it? You know, this is possible, because Jesus guaranteed it in the prayer when he said : ‘Your kingdom come . . .’” (Go ahead with the sermon “Your Will Be Done on Earth.”)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">- For variety, or in speaking with Jews, one could say: “I am calling to give brief consideration to a common problem that exists. This is a season when people try to forget their differences and seek to be united in peace. But even so, conditions are far from what God originally purposed.” (Then, with Genesis 2 : 15, go into the “Paradise” sermon.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> For the magazine work, which will be prominent in December, we</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommend Yourself by Kindness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Do not forget kindness to strangers.” Why does the Bible so counsel us? “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling,” said the apostle, “that our ministry might not be found fault with; but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, ... by kindness.” So kindness is one of the ways we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers. —Heb. 13: 2; 2 Cor. 6:3,4, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Kindness calls for courtesy. Publishers can never afford to forget this gracious quality. 'When a householder tries to make a comment, do you show courtesy by letting him talk or do you keep right on talking yourself? When a householder asks you to sit down, always acknowledge his consideration, even though for some reason it may not be wise to could use a similar approach. Subjects like peace, thankfulness, God’s will, Jesus’ birth and the purpose in his coming to earth, the Kingdom and kingship of Christ are good to use.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Many well-meaning persons will say as you leave their home: “I wish you a merry Christmas,” or “Merry Christmas and a happy new year.” How can one reply? You might tactfully answer in this manner : “Thank you. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with you and know you will have many happy hours reading about God’s wonderful purpose of a new world.” Or, “In return, I hope you and your family have much enjoyment as you read the book [or magazine] with your Bible.” Or you might say: “Thank you. I hope to be able to talk with you again.” Thus you avoid making an issue of our stand regarding Christmas and leave an opening for a later call to teach the person more, about the primary thing, the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">comply. When entering a home, do you, if a brother, forget to remove your hat? Do you take uninvited steps into a person’s home? Do not let lack of courtesy rob you of a recommendation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Your manners are the barometer that the householder observes. If in doubt as to the right thing, do the kind thing. If you think of walking across freshly planted grass, ask yourself: Is it kind? Likewise, it is not courteous to lean against the house while talking to a householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Discourteous habits detract from the Kingdom message. When two publishers go to a door it is a joint assignment; both should pay attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Be kind, be courteous. Recommend yourself as God’s minister.</span></p></li></ul>

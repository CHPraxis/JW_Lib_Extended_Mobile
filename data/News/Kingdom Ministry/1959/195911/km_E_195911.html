<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Study Aids to Be Offered</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded yon.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) This is the divine will for us. Are you </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">seeking</span><span class="font11"> to do it? If you must be reminded every month to engage in field service, can you say you are? Publishers who seek to do the divine will do it because it is in their heart, because they desire to serve. They look for opportunities to preach. Do you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The month’s theme text, at Hebrews 13:20, 21, states that God will equip us “with every good thing to do his will.” He does this through the good instruction and fine study aids we receive. Outstanding are the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Darth.”</span><span class="font11"> What splendid instruments these are to offer as we do the divine will! The first is milk of the Word, the second is meat. One lays the foundation for the other. Is this not an ideal combination for teaching people God’s truth?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Have your sermon and key talking points on the books well in mind, and then rehearse the sermon with your family or other publishers. Make the presentation at every door, especially in territories that have not been covered with either book. When the combination is not accepted, offer a choice of either book. At the time of each placement, offer to demonstrate how to use the book. Many studies can thus be started on the initial call. One congregation reports that most of seventy-nine studies started in one week were begun this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book sparks interest. A circuit servant writes: “One Sunday morning I had just started to witness to a woman when she interrupted: ‘I don’t have any money to buy books.’ Apparently she knew we were Jehovah’s witnesses and was not disposed to listen. After explaining that our purpose was to cultivate a better understanding of the Bible, we continued with the sermon. While we</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Every month in the United States over a million back-calls are made! Our desire in calling back is not only to talk but to teach. We want these people to get the sense of the message and see the urgency of acting in harmony with it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For best results, we should call </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">teithin a week</span><span class="font11"> after our initial visit. Is that too soon? Not at.all. especially if we have paved the way on our first call. Before making the back-call, know what you intend to say when they answer the door. Have</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Heb. 13:20, 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">clearly in mind what points you want to teach them, and how. Plan a transition to the publication you want to study. Decide how to arrange for the next call.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As a good teacher, you will not do all the talking; get your student involved in the discussion. Suggest that he get his own Bible; ask him to read some of the scriptures. Draw out his thoughts with questions. If the householder expresses keen interest in a certain Bible subject, and you are equipped to discuss it, it may be better to pursue that than to hold rigidly to your sermon. Follow through on the interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Knowing that they need a regular study to learn the truth, we should work toward that end. After an were presenting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book the woman’s attitude began to change. In wonderment she said: ‘And it’s only seventy-five cents?’ Needless to say, she took a copy. No matter how much a territory has </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 4, col. 1) appropriate introduction, perhaps using a scripture or two, you might open the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good Rews of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font11"> or another appropriate publication to the paragraphs that contain the points you want to discuss. Use the questions. Look up the scriptures; discuss them. Read the paragraphs. Thus both present the subject and start a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> An effective teacher is warm and friendly, and he does not go too fast. It is surprising how many thiiigs people do not really grasp, even when we read them from the Bible. Be a teacher: emphasize the main point of each scripture, illustrate it, and question the householder to be sure he understands it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> On your call it is good to explain the objective of our work. They may feel they have to join something, and so hesitate to have you return. Realizing the problem may exist, we can point out that their choice of religion is up to them, but our work is to teach the Bible to persons of good will free of charge. Let them know what the Kingdom means to them. Point out how important accurate knowledge is, that our lives are involved. Show that we are motivated by love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> When you leave the call, analyze your teaching. Ask yourself : What did they learn? How do I know they got the point? How can I improve my teaching on back-calls? To become effective teachers we must teach regularly. Make it a point to spend at least one hour each week teaching on back-calls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Theme: Seeking to Do the Divine Will on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Welcome, text, and talk on theme for the month, “Seeking to Do the Divine Will on Earth.’’ (See “Watchtower,” February 15, 1959, p. 100, and November 1, 1959, p. 662.) 18 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the article “Seek to Do the Divine Will on Earth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">(12 min.) Chairman points out that in two-book offer either book may be stressed. Having used the sermon “Your Will Be Done on Earth” for several months, we have it well in mind, but not so the “Paradise” sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Have “Paradise” sermon outline on platform for all to see and follow. Review sermon with audience, giving due attention to transitions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In conclusion, illustrations on pages 16 (or 20, 21) and 241 may be effectively used. Offer two books together for contribution of $1.25, making only brief comments on “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” since “Paradise” book has been featured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(6 min.) Publisher prepared in advance gives model sermon, applying teaching techniques. Stop just as books are placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(7 min.) Chairman commends publisher on fine sermon and asks what he would do now to start study with householder on initial call. After brief discussion, publisher continues. Tells householder he would be glad to show her how the “Paradise” book can best be studied with her Bible, if she would like to take just a few minutes. Householder appreciates suggestion, invites him in. Publisher comments on keen desire to see paradise restored, turns to first paragraph of book to show what God’s Word means w<sup>T</sup>hen it speaks of paradise. Begin study, considering first paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Chairman encourages all to apply this suggestion. If householder cannot take time then, show understanding and arrange definite time for return call.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">New World News and announcements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min; </span><span class="font10">Refresher on “Paradise” Back-Call Sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After Bible study servant has emphasized importance of making return visits, he will take about twelve minutes to lead audience through pictures used in “Paradise” back-call sermon, commenting on each one as outlined here. Encourage publishers to take this occasion to make notes in their study copy that they will use on back-calls. May make note of comment on illustration and page of next illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">BACK-CALL SERMON: God’s purpose for man: live forever and make entire earth a paradise like Eden. (Pages 20, 21) Disobedience brought loss of paradise and condemnation of death. Loving-kindness of God shown in preservation of God-fearing ones at Flood (40, 41) but destruction of wicked. (42, 43) Also, shows Jehovah’s concern for a righteous earth. Though men returned to wickedness after Flood, God selected people for his name’s sake and gave law to them (64, 65), part of which he wrote, to lead them to Savior. Savior’s birth (124), in fulfillment of many prophecies, brought further hope to believers. Before dying as ransom (141) to pay back what was lost in original paradise, he promised evildoer, “You will be with me in Paradise,” giving assurance earthly paradise to be restored. Resurrection and ascension (144, 145) as conqueror of death opened way for gaining life everlasting. Set pattern for future resurrections from death. Kingdom is means God uses to restore Paradise. Birth of Kingdom described in Revelation as pictured. (176, &nbsp;177) Its establishment with</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christ as King portends destruction for Devil and his wicked world at Armageddon. (208, 209) With Satan’s influence gone, conditions to come on earth will satisfy desire of all believers. (217) With paradise regained, dead in memory of God will return (233) to join survivors of Armageddon ; on earth, where tears, pain and death will be no more. (241) Point out that pictures are an aid to understanding, but Scriptural discussions are needed for accurate knowledge of requirements for living in paradise regained. Turn to opening chapter and, beginning with first paragraph, show them how a Scriptural discussion can profitably be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a conclusion, arrange for publishers who have had success with this back-call sermon to relate experiences. Sermon will be demonstrated in weeks to come, and other experiences may be related then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on Matthew 5:6, at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Questions and answers on * ‘Congregation Organization. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: “Yearbook” experiences on back-calls. (82, 88, 112) Enthusiastic publisher discusses experiences with training program companion as encouragement to expand back-call activity. Conclude with encouragement to make back-calls on all who take literature and even others who show interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Model “Paradise” back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Talk: “Be a Teacher on Back-Calls,” along with report from Bible study servant on visit with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Talk covering “Yearbook” experiences on vacation pioneer service. (155, 201, 202, 206, 207, 242) It is for young and old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration on “Vacation Pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Congregations where many have vacation pioneered, spirit of congregation has improved, maturity increased, activity built up. Society reports 17,865 enrolled as vacation pioneers last year, or 130 percent more than year before. Of these, 8,133, or 46 percent, vacation pioneered for two weeks. Even more can share in vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">INTERVIEW (13 min.) (Select, if possible, a housewife, a young publisher, brother with family responsibilities and a seasonal worker who have shared in this privilege. If none in congregation have pioneered, then experiences from “Pursuing My Purpose in Life” articles on problems overcome and joys experienced in regular pioneer service may be related by pre-selected publishers.) Chairman, interviewing those who have pioneered, asks how they found the time, what prompted them to pioneer, what schedule they arranged, what family co-operation was received, etc. Questions regarding blessings received, assistance given to others, and whether, they would recommend vacation pioneering may also be asked. Practical, factual answers will be of most value to all. If time permits, have experiences enjoyed in pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) December holiday period offers real opportunity for many to vacation pioneer. School children have time off, generally two weeks. Parents, consider pioneering with them during this period. Requirements: one must have been a regular publisher for six months and be baptized in symbol of dedication. Can spend as little as two weeks, or several months, as a vacation pioneer. Quota for two weeks is not less than 75 hours for the month (at least 50 hours during the two weeks of pioneering and 25 additional hours during remainder of the month). If pioneering for a full month, quota is 100 hours. Perhaps it will be possible to continue pioneering after December. If so, request an extension. Keep full-time pioneering in mind. (See “Preaching Together in Unity,” pars. 68, 69, and September, 1955, “Informant.”) Parents, encourage your children to make full-time pioneer service vocation in life and set example by vacation pioneering whenever possible. Be a blessing to others, build up yourself spiritually and offer greater praise to Jehovah; be a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Ask questions on article “Can You Be a Vacation Pioneer?” Continue with talk by competent local brother. Urge all who can to take up regular pioneer service, if possible; if not, at least arrange to be a vacation pioneer some time each year. (See letters on pioneer service sent out by Society during the past year.)</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Care of the Kingdom Hall</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A clean, neat and commodious Kingdom Hall not only provides a pleasurable place in which to meet, but it is an asset in giving a good witness in the community. It matters not whether the congregation is small and meeting in a private home, or large with a hall especially built or remodeled, it should be the desire of each congregation to have a Kingdom Hall that is a credit to the name we bear—Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To keep the Kingdom Hall clean and in good repair, good co-operation on the part of all is required. The congregation servant has the responsibility to oversee the upkeep of the Kingdom Hall. So that all might share in keeping a nice place to meet, it is recommended that he make up a schedule for the various service center groups to take turns in cleaning the hall and an outline of things that need to be done each week. One or two groups might be assigned each month. Otherwise, there is a tendency for most of the work to fall on a willing few. The grounds around the hall should also receive regular attention. We all enjoy walking into a clean, fresh hall at meeting time. It does not just happen that way. Let us all share in keeping our Kingdom Hall presentable and a place to which we can feel proud to invite persons of good will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The Kingdom Hall should be appropriately and tastefully advertised. There are several ways</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">this can be done. First, there should be an outside sign identifying the hall as “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” A smaller sign giving public notice of the meetings and times should be posted so that any interested can see this from outside the building. Many congregations find that it is possible to put up moderate-size highway signs at the city limits giving the location of the Kingdom Hall and the time of meetings. Newspapers will often print free the time of meetings and the title of the Bible lecture in the “Church Directory.” Take advantage of these various means to advertise the Kingdom Hall and the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If the Kingdom Hall has a display window some of the Society’s publications should be neatly displayed. This is the responsibility of the magazine-territory servant. It should always be neat and should be changed regularly, usually once a month. Magazines used in the display should be the latest magazines. Inside the Kingdom Hall provision may be made by the literature servant for a display of the Society’s publications at the literature counter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The Kingdom Hall is truly the center of New World activity in the community. To reflect favorably upon Jehovah’s good name and organization it must be well kept and people must know about it. Use it well to expand true worship in the community to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Can You Be a Vacation Pioneer?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Why vacation pioneer? It is the divine will for those in position to do so. Besides the joy that comes from doing the divine will by vacation pioneering there are many other blessings. Vacation pioneering is an aid to maturity. “I feel much stronger spiritually,” said one publisher after vacation pioneering. “If all publishers would vacation pioneer for just one month,” wrote another, “they really could see why pioneering is so wonderful.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Who can vacation pioneer? Those who can devote two weeks or a month or more in Kingdom service, averaging a little more than three hours a day. School children during winter vacation can do so for two weeks. Besides preparing youthful ministers for pioneering upon completing school, it aids to safeguard them against harm from bad associations during school vacations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When can many adults vacation pioneer? Housewives with children at school can do so during many of the school months. Those whose secular work is slow during certain weeks of the year may be able to vacation pioneer at that time. Some whose health does not permit pioneering all year may be able to vacation pioneer two weeks or a month or several months.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Publishers are now quite skilled with the use of the sermon “Your Will Be Done on Earth,” which will be fine for the offer. Eor variety we can also use the sermon “Earth to Become a Paradise.” As an introduction one might say : “Good morning. My name is----. I am calling in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">the community in an effort to help people regain something that was lost many years ago. Have you ever lost something—perhaps a valuable or a loved one—and afterward said: ‘I would give anything in the world if I could regain it’? Most people have. But did you know that all mankind lost something nearly six thousand years ago and it has never been found? Well, here at Genesis 2:15 the Bible tells us what was lost . . .” (If an objection comes up during this introduction, one can add, in a kind, tactful way, that the householder has nothing to lose and everything to gain by consideration of what he was going to say.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Whichever sermon and book we present first, we will also bring to the householder's attention the other book, but it is not usually good to say much about the second book offered. Do not wear out and confuse the householder’s mind by going into the second hook with a complete</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah has equipped us well to be teachers. Now it is up to us to seek proficiency. Listen carefully at the service meetings and apply what you learn.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> When Thanksgiving Day arrives, more people will be home and thus more can be given a witness. This is to be a special Magazine Day. Be sure to send the interesting experiences you have in this work to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> What about the goal for December? Is your eye on it? Our aim, remember, is 10-percent increase in publishers. Can we make it? We can if each publisher works for it by helping new ones in service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Encourage new ones to see the demonstration of it. Make a strong, appealing presentation of one book, then bring in the second book, its “mate,” as a complement of the other, making only a few brief remarks about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book has been presented first, one might say next: “This book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Your Will Be Done on Earth’</span><span class="font11"> complements the other in that it explains prophecies foretelling the movements of the nations in this very day when God’s will is about to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Both books are yours for a contribution of only $1.25.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth” </span><span class="font11">has been presented first, then one could add: “This book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font11"> will help you and your family to understand why God has permitted these things to take place and what we can do to live in happiness on a paradise earth.” (Offer both books for $1.25.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommend the New with &quot;The Watchtower&quot;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">21st Annual “Watchtower” Campaign Begins</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Truly we have new things to recommend. We have a new message, the good news of the established kingdom, which no previous generation has known; we have a new organization—the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, directed by the “faithful and discreet slave.” How happy we are that we can recommend these to the people! We rejoice that Jehovah has not left it to the old religious organizations of Satan’s world to recommend this new message. “No one puts new wine into old wineskins,” said Jesus. “But new wine must be put into new wineskins.” So God is using a new organization to bring men of good will this new message, this new wine. Starting January 1, we will be “recommending the new” by participating in the twenty-first annual </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign.—Luke 5: 37, 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> At the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses we passed a resolution to express our firm stand for recommending the new. During December we recorh-mended the new by widely distributing the Resolution tract. Great interest has been aroused. Let all publishers now follow through by offering these interested people a year’s subscription foi' </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and three booklets for $1. Have you called back yet on all your Resolution placements? If not, make this your primary Kingdom work during the first part of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Though we will stress </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> during this four-month campaign, if the householder has already subscribed for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!</span><span class="font11"> may be offered; and publishers who wish to offer both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and six booklets for $2 may do so. (Publishers will remit 90c for each new subscription.) If a subscription is not taken, leave the latest copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> for 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What is your quota for the campaign? For congregation publishers it is two; for pioneers 20 and for special pioneers 30.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Begin the campaign by using worldly “New Year’s Day” to good advantage; recommend the new that brings true happiness. With schools closed, young publishers will be able to join in that day. Let each congregation arrange special contacts on this day for the convenience of the brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Are you ready for the campaign ? Think of your acquaintances and persons on whom you make back-calls. Write down the names of these prospective subscribers so that you are certain to call on them. Congregations should organize their territory so that all of it will be covered during the campaign. Order enough magazines. Have on hand enough subscription blanks. Reflect now on the importance of accuracy and completeness when filling out subscription slips.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JANUARY “Watchtower” subscription for one year and three booklets for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR JANUARY Recommending the New Instead of the Old.—Luke 5: 38.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Plan to be ready to take subscriptions for foreign-language </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font11"> too. Review the list on the second page of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> so you know what is available. Are there people in your territory who speak and read foreign languages? If so, are you prepared with a supply of the appropriate foreign-language </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers?</span><span class="font11"> The same offer and rate apply to all semimonthly issues. The yearly subscription rate for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font11"> published once a month is 50c. (Publishers will remit 45c.) With this subscription, offer one booklet. Be alert to the fact that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is published in fifty-two languages; it will help you reach your quota.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Many householders feel that they have enough magazines, so we need to give them adequate motive for subscribing for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font11">Let the householder understand from your sermon that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is not just another magazine recommending the old but that It truly recommends the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">new.</span><span class="font11"> Have the new sermon “Earth as Man’s Home” well in mind. Put forth reasonable efforts to give it at every door. After a well-chosen transition, present </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> enthusiastically, using as talking points those articles that you think will appeal most to the public.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Productive Ministry by Showing Love</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> One of our goals for the year is: Working for a productive ministry by showing greater love. It takes true love to be regular in Kingdom service during the winter. Show greater love by being at the service contact points regularly and on time. “As a right kind of soldier of Christ Jesus,” be willing to endure winter weather to recommend the new. Show loving consideration for the householder in cold weather by suggesting that you step inside. By doing this, when it seems advisable, you will be more productive, too; you wfill be better able to give your sermon. Show love by co-operating fully in the training program during the winter. Show love by speaking your good message from the heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> So prepare now to recommend the new with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font11">Greater love will mean a productive ministry. And by a productive ministry we show we are truly awake to the vital import in our yeartext: “Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.” —Rev. 16:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">7 min: New World News coverage and announcements of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">23 min: Develop and demonstrate a sermon for the “Watchtower” campaign. A competent brother should be selected as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Importance of having well-prepared, thought-provoking sermon to capture and hold householder’s attention. “Watchtower” campaign lasts four months. The sermon below has been designed for use during this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">PREPARING THE SERMON: (12 min.) Congregation develops sermon under chairman’s direction. Have sermon outline on platform for all to see and follow. After considering the theme, chairman may call for suggested introductions from audience, and then proceed with introduction, body and conclusion as outlined below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Earth as Man’s Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A suggested introduction: “Good morning. I am a minister making brief home calls to bring some good news concerning our home. All of us need to have a home to live in, do we not? And just as we want our homes to be safe, comfortable, enjoyable and blessed with security and happiness, so we would like to see the entire earth. Today, however, it seems this earthly home of ours has become a dangerous place in which to live, especially in view of increasing crimes and troubles everywhere, not to mention the fearful things that people face in this space age. It makes many wonder what will happen to this earth, which is man’s home. By going to the Bible we can find out. It tells us who made the earth and why and what kind of place it will eventually be. Here at Psalm 24: 1 earth’s Creator and Owner is identified for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. Earth belongs to Jehovah—Ps.24:1 2. Gave it to man as a home</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">—Ps. 115: 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3. Founded to last forever—Ps. 104: 5 4. To be ruled by God’s kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">—Matt. 6: 9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font10"> Will become glorious place in which to live —Rev. 21: 4, 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Suggestion for conclusion: “What a blessing it will be to live on an earth where such new conditions exist! God’s kingdom will make such things possible and since that is our prayer we need to know all we possibly can about the permanent home where, righteous mankind will live forever. Provision has been made for you to gain necessary knowledge of this through this Bible-study aid ‘The Watchtower,’ which announces Jehovah’s kingdom. Here on page . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">MODEL SERMON (7 min.) Publisher selected beforehand gives model sermon and householder takes offer. Back-call arrangements are made for quick return visit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">15 min: Reading of January 1, 1959, pioneer letter and a talk based on the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [1 Cor. 16: 14] at bottom of page four.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Blessings from Serving Where the Need Is Great.” The 1959 “Yearbook” stresses as never before the privilege of serving where the need is great (285-287). In the United States a brother traveled some 3,000 miles with his family to serve. Soon a congregation was organized, and they saw it increase 227 percent in the first year (78). Telling of how Jehovah provides for those taking this step is the report from France (156). There, as well as in a similar instance in Norway (228), a congregation was soon organized. And showing exemplary appreciation of the privilege of serving where the need is great is the British couple who, not being able to do both, chose to go where the need is great in distant Pakistan instead of attending the Divine Will International Assembly (232). Can you serve where the need is great?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Serving Where the Need Is Great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Demonstration on ways to utilize the “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) All publishers should read the “Yearbook.” It has spiritual food for every day, it keeps us alert to the truth, it reviews much of what was published in “The Watchtower” during the year, it informs us on advancement of the work worldwide and brings us close to our brothers in other lands. But do more than read the “Yearbook,” use it! There are many ways this can be done. (Chairman should briefly introduce each of the following scenes.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (7 min.) A family is considering the morning text. Text is read and father calls for a question. Mother asks a question based on the Scripture text and involving points contained in “The Watchtower” comments. Father calls on son, who remembers seeing it in “The Watchtower” but cannot remember enough to make a comment. Daughter is called on next. She does not remember details, but remembers enough to make a general comment. Mother has looked up information on the point and gives a detailed answer to the question. Father gives a summarizing comment on the text and expresses appreciation for the “Yearbook’s” review of this point that it might be impressed on them. He then reads the comments in the “Yearbook.” He admonishes family to prepare for morning’s discussion as mother did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (6 min.) Home Bible study has just concluded. Householder is invited to share in field service. He states that he would like to but does not see how he can with an opposing wife. Publisher expresses understanding of problem. Recalls reading in “Yearbook” about someone in a similar position. Requests good-will person to get his “Yearbook” and turn to page 161. Asks him to read experience and then comments that the person was blessed for going ahead with confidence in Jehovah. His perseverance helped his wife to see the truth. Householder is impressed. He expresses determination to go along with publisher in preaching work and to pray for guidance that he might be able to help his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE HI (6 min.) Husband is reading “Yearbook” and calls to wife, who is preparing a meal. He asks if she remembers the man he met in the field service -who manifested interest but would not take literature offer. She recalls him. He states that the “Yearbook” has shown him what he should have done (102). He should have given him a tract. Wife remembers a similar experience and relates it (104, last paragraph). She remarks that she has been helped many times by experiences in the “Yearbook.” As an example she mentions that the Society stresses early back-calls. Because she did not think it would work she did not try making them. But the other day she read an experience from Hawaii (174) on the good results of making early back-calls. He remarks that more publishers should realize how helpful the “Yearbook” can be in improving their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Summarize different ways of using “Yearbook.” Encourage all to read it. Look for points to enrich your appreciation and to improve your abilities as a minister. By reading for a few minutes each day it does not take long to read the “Yearbook” through and thus you will benefit from the fine experiences our brothers in other lands have had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Reports from literature and accounts servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Demonstration: At conclusion of home Bible study publisher answers questions about service for good-will person, basing comments on “Make Sure of All Things,” from Matt. 24: 14 on page 270 to end of page 271.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Arrange locally. (A suggested talk: “Works of Faith and Love.” See “Watchtower,” 8/15/58, p. 489.) 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Visit with Literature and Accounts Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It will be the privilege of the congregation servant to meet with the literature servant and the accounts servant during January and discuss ways of improving their work. While keeping records is only indirectly related to the preaching activities of a congregation, these details are nonetheless essential to its smooth operation. The accounts records must be accurate and up to date so that the congregation’s obligations are regularly met, and ordering and caring for literature must be handled conscientiously if publishers are to have the equipment needed for their ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> All three servants should review the points outlined in the January, 1958, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> under “Congregation Organization,” as well as material in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers </span><span class="font11">pertaining to the duties of the literature and accounts servants. This, as well as auditing and bringing the records up to date, should be done before their meeting sometime at the beginning of the month. Their discussion should center around three basic points: (1) Improving service to the brothers at the King-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Circuit servants report that some congregations do not have their accounts audited every three months. The congregation servant should always arrange to do this or appoint a capable brother to do the auditing. This will help to avoid delinquent accounts or inadvertent errors that may be carried on the books for a number of months. The congregation should know the standing of its accounts month by month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is expected that the accounts and literature servants will be good field workers. Each should be associated with a service center and actively engage in the training of other’ publishers under the training program and otherwise. This feature of their ministry should be taken up thoroughly at the meeting held, realizing that the field ministry and the training of new ministers are the most important obligations resting upon us. The congregation servant should arrange to work with both servants several times during the month.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Society is receiving letters from brothers all over the United States expressing the desire to serve where the need is great. Those already serving in these fields have made many happy expressions of thankfulness for the privileges of service. One says: “The brothers have warmly received us here. We will work hard and exert ourselves vigorously to assist in gathering the ‘other sheep’ and build up our brothers by working with them, strengthening the training program and developing the service centers.” A brother with a family writes: “We have moved here and I have been blessed with an adequate secular job. . . . My wife and I have given up some things, but we know that spiritual blessings will far surpass any material goods or pleasures.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> There are still many localities where the need is great, especially in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. Many small congregations cannot cover their territory properly or take care of the interest, while in some isolated places there Is territory that has not been worked for several years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When you write to the Society to express your desire to serve where the need is great, please tell us the name of the congregation with which you are now associated and whether you have a family. For each one in your group give the age and service qualifications, years and experience in the service; state which ones are servants in the congregation, languages spoken and any other facts about theocratic background. In this way we can make recommendations that will employ your qualifications to the greatest advantage. Also indicate in what part of the country you can serve, naming the state or states. Inform us as to whether you will have to find parttime or full-time secular work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There are some places where the need is great but secular work is scarce. There may be some who are retired or who have an income or the financial means to serve without secular work. If so, let us know and we can recommend these places. All should realize, of course, that while the brothers are glad to have your assistance and will do what they can to furnish information and help you get settled, yet you will be entirely responsible to make your own arrangements for housing, secular work and related matters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Leaving a Favorable Impression</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> From the moment you knock on the dooi<sup>-</sup> till you have gone from their sight, people tend to look at you as representative of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Kingdom message is often judged accordingly. To leave a favorable impression you will want to put the Kingdom message first, with self in the background. Neat, clean clothing and a tidy appearance are essential. Extreme fads or peculiarities should be avoided. Important, too, is the right mental attitude toward the people you meet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We want to leave householders with a more friendly attitude, if possible, than when we found them. If they are genuinely busy, it would be better to arrange courteously to call again than to have them remember that you made them “miss an appointment.” A tract may be left for them to consider in the meantime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As we offer our sermon they may raise arguments against the message. In a tactful, kindly way, refute them. To reply sharply or to show contempt for their beliefs will only entrench the false reasonings more deeply in their minds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If, after the sermon is presented, they decline to accept the literature offered, let them know you have</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Recognizing Jehovah’s blessing, which was abundantly manifest upon our service during October, we are grateful for the obtaining of 144,746 new subscriptions in the United States for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> This is cause for rejoicing as it means these thousands of new subscribers will regularly have life-giving truths coming to their home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It is noteworthy that 5,874 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions were taken in thirty languages other than English, and 3,117 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions in fourteen languages, not Including English. This should make all of us conscious of the need to offer subscriptions in languages other than English to householders desiring the magazines in their naappreciated the opportunity to talk with them. Rather than display disappointment, gladly offer them a tract or a handbill to read.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Leaving a favorable impression does not stop with the closing of the door behind you. Often householders will watch you until you are out of sight. Untactful actions, gestures or facial expressions may be interpreted as evidence of insincerity. Remarks about the call or loud counsel to a training companion about what might have been said or done may be overheard and misunderstood. Conduct yourself with Christian dignity at all times, that a favorable impression may be left in the minds of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Since September, 1957, the essential qualities of sermons have been considered under “Presenting the Good News.” This is the thirteenth and final article of the series. From time to time review all these essential qualities of sermons and use them in your ministry.</span></p>

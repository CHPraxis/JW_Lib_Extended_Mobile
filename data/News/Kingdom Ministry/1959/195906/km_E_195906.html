<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA “Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.”—Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL II NO. 6</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Let Each One Pay Attention to the Flock of God</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Even as in Jesus’ time, there are many persons today who are “skinned and knocked about like sheep without a shepherd.” These we must not only search out but, having found them, feed them and lead them to the Right Shepherd. Home Bible studies enable us to do this effectively.—Matt. 9: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> That is why our goal is one new study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book for each publisher. In view of the fact that the book is easily placed, surely that goal is attainable by all. Are we enthusiastic about the prospect of such a study? Do we really want to have one? Do we truly enjoy conducting a study? Then take advantage of every opportunity to start one. Book study conductors can help in this by reviewing suggestions on starting Bible studies that have been presented on the service meeting. Do it each week during June at your regular contacts for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In conducting a study let us not overlook other members of the family of the interested one. Tactfully suggest that they will all benefit by sitting in on the study. Where a sister is studying with the wife, she might suggest having her husband (or one of the servants in the congregation) come along to meet the man of the house. Many sisters do this with excellent results. Where the man of the house responds, they often find it advantageous for both to continue to go to the study. If more such opportunities were utilized, doubtless more men would be among those baptized at assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For June house-to-house activity, begin with territory that has been the longest without a witness. If this means witnessing in the rurals, be efficient. It is better not to take a full ear of workers unless able to keep everyone busy, including the car driver, perhaps letting them out in a row and then picking them up again. Otherwise, it is preferable for two or three to work from a car while the rest witness in urban territory, regardless of how recently it may have been covered. Enthusiastically offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book in your territory during June. If you exhaust your supplies, then keep on</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">239,418 Publishers in April</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a fine report for April! For this obvious demonstration of hard work we have been rewarded with an 18.4-percent increase. While it is not quite what we had hoped for, still this represents 18,347 new publishers in the field ministry over March, which is a splendid showing indeed! Let us all help them to become strong Kingdom publishers. The number of congregations that reported “We Made It!” in April was 1,420. Congregations that did not make the 20-percent goal should not feel despondent but rather exert themselves vigorously to make it before the end of the service year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JUNE “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained” and one booklet for 75c. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Paying Attention to the Flock of God. i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Acts 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostle Paul exhorts us: Do not “give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.”—Gal. 6: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The result of the four-month </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> campaign shows a total of 439,108 new subscriptions, against 444,384 for last year. While this is a slight drop under last year’s total, nevertheless, it is an excellent number of subscriptions. We should recognize each subscription as a personal responsibility and a potential study. Let us not wait for the mailman to do our back-call work for us. Accept this as your respon-working with whatever older book you may have in stock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In all such ways each one, not only the overseers, can pay his share of attention to God’s flock and attain his goal of one new Bible study during this campaign.—Acts 20 : 28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">sibility, make these calls and develop the interest, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We had an outstanding attendance of 354,983 at the Memorial, which is an increase of 29,877 over last year, and attendance at the special public meeting went up 29,022 from last year’s figure to 247,176. This is something to be thrilled over, because it shows a great crowd turning to the perfect government for all mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps even more encouraging than our attendance increases is the new peak in home Bible studies. A year ago we had 176,174 and this April the studies have increased to 204,660. This is close to 2,000 more home Bible studies than our March peak. Keep up the good work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As for our special magazine distribution, we placed 4,210,697 magazines. Even though this was less than last year’s excellent showing, still it does represent a good increase over the average number of magazines placed thus far this service year. The special pioneers averaged 144.9 magazines, but in April 'they increased their placements to 162.7. The regular pioneers averaged 105.1 and went up to 120.1. As for the congregation publishers, they averaged 12.1 but increased their placements to 13.9 for, April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Now let us not only look ahead, but push ahead, consolidating our gains, working hard to make up where we have fallen short, petitioning Jehovah’s help, with our hearts set on his vindication and praise.—Heb. 6 :10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Paying Attention to the Flock of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: </span><span class="font9">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on monthly theme and “1959 District Assemblies.” (See “Watchtower,” 1/15/58, p. 51, and 6/1/59, p. 339.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Questions and answers on the article “Let Each One Pay Attention to the Flock of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">23 min: </span><span class="font9">Demonstration on “Start Studies in ‘Paradise’ Book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Enjoyed using “Paradise” book one month, appreciate value. People want it; hope of paradise appeals to them. Brother Enthusiastic appreciates this, is having fine time placing “Paradise” book. Watch his effective presentation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (6 min.) Enthusiastic gives “Paradise” sermon to responsive householder, offers “Paradise” book, which is readily taken. Householder agrees to have him call again; publisher leaves, happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Calls Enthusiastic over, comments on fine sermon, aroused interest, householder sheeplike. Enthusiastic agrees, is convinced he has found a sheep. Chairman asks if he thinks that call accomplished what it could have. Enthusiastic is perplexed; he placed book, she said he could come again. What else could be done? “Why not start a study?” Chairman asks. Enthusiastic did not think about that. Chairman: Start study while you have interest of householder; after you leave, she may get involved in other things; hard to regain interest. Watch Brother Alert, who is concluding presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (6 min.) Alert explaining pictures on pages 16 and 241. Householder accepts offer. After receiving contribution, Alert tells householder he has. few minutes before he must make next call, will be glad to briefly show her how this book can best be studied with her Bible if she has a few minutes. Householder agrees, invites him to step in. Inside, Alert comments on wide variation of opinions on what paradise is, turns to first paragraph of book to discuss Bible’s answer. Question is asked, discussed, paragraph read, second question asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Interrupts study and enthusiastically points out the ease and value of this method for starting studies on initial call. Brother Enthusiastic acknowledges value of this arrangement, has heard of good results others enjoy in using it and will now try to apply counsel in his own ministry. Still has question though: “What if householder is busy and cannot take time then?” Chairman explains that publishers should show understanding and arrange a definite time for a return visit. Important to arrange for a definite time so householder will expect caller. Both agree on value of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) People eager for book. Appeals to them. They cannot realize hope of paradise just by taking book. Must learn the truth to find paradise. This through home Bible study. Do not miss opportunities to start studies in “Paradise.” Let the book accomplish its purpose of helping them find way to paradise so our spiritual paradise may be peopled now in preparation for regaining earthly paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Talk on “239,418 Publishers in April” and closing announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: “New World News” and announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Questions and answers and talk on “Dedication and Baptism.” (See Congregation Organization.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">27 min: Demonstration on “Effective Use of ‘Paradise’ Book on Back-Calls.” Bible study servant will handle this. Each of the remaining weeks in June Bible study servant will select a different publisher to develop the 10-minute call. Follow it with experiences of publishers using the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Excellent new instrument for teaching has been furnished in “Paradise” book. Many have been placed. Now we must follow up placements with purposeful back-calls. Illustrations can skillfully be used to impress value of book in understanding what Bible teaches. Back-call sermon to consist of using pictures to stimulate interest in studying book. To be accomplished by showing selected pictures to person of good will, explaining their significance and giving coherent explanation of how they tie together in explaining God’s purposes for earth and man. Discussion to follow will suggest pictures that may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DISCUSSION (10 min.) Three brothers discuss together pictures in book and how they can be used in back-calls. Audience should follow in their copies of “Paradise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brothers agree that it would be best to start with purpose of God for man: live forever, make entire earth a paradise like Eden, have dominion over earth and animals. (Pages 20, 21) Disobedience brought loss of paradise and condemnation of death. Loving-kindness of God demonstrated in preservation of God-fearing ones at Flood (40, 41) but destruction of wicked. (42, 43) Also, shows Jehovah’s concern for a righteous earth. Though men returned to wickedness after Flood, God selected people for his name’s sake and gave law to them (64, 65), part of which he wrote, to lead them to Savior. Savior’s birth (124), in fulfillment of many prophecies, brought further hope to believers. Before dying as ransom (141) to pay back what was lost in original paradise, he promised evildoer, “You will be with me in Paradise,” giving assurance earthly paradise to be restored. Resurrection and ascension (144, 145) as conqueror of death opened way for gaining life everlasting. Set pattern for future resurrections from death. Kingdom is means God uses to restore Paradise. Birth of Kingdom described in Revelation as pictured. (176, 177) Its establishment with Christ as King portends destruction for Devil and his wicked world at Armageddon. (208, 209) With Satan’s influence gone, conditions to come on earth will satisfy desire of all believers. (217) With Paradise regained, dead in memory of God will return (233) to join survivors of Armageddon on earth, where tears, pain and death will be no more. (241) Brothers agree that they will then point out to good-will person that the pictures are an aid to understanding, but Scriptural discussions needed for accurate knowledge of requirements for living in Paradise regained. Turn to opening chapter and begin by discussing questions on page nine with person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(12 min.) Competent brother or sister makes back-call using sermon outlined, following through to starting of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(2 min.) Chairman concludes with admonition for all to try this method on back-calls to start studies. On each of remaining service meetings during June different brother or sister, prepared in advance, will take 10 minutes to present sermon, using pictures as above. Five minutes of experiences from audience will follow, showing practicalness of this method in starting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6 min: Concluding comments. (Include something about statement based on 2 Tim. 4:5 at bottom of page one.)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Dedication and Baptism</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Provision has been made for an immersion service at each of the Awake Ministers District Assemblies. Baptismal candidates should be in the designated seats before the program begins on Saturday morning so they will hear the entire talk on dedication and baptism. Listen carefully, so that when the two questions are propounded to determine whether you are worthy to be baptized, you can answer with understanding. That answer should be given loudly and clearly so it can be heard and understood by those present. It would be well for those who plan to be baptized to review the August 1, 1958, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> before the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some, on the basis of the August 1, 1958, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> have decided that they should be baptized again. This is because they had not made a valid dedication before their first baptism, but now they have made such a dedication. When this is done, the assistant congregation servant should be notified and he will enter the new baptism date on the Publisher’s Record card alongside the old date, with a notation that the publisher was rebaptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When one is rebaptized, it does not necessarily mean that he must be removed from his privileges of service as a servant or in some other capacity, provided he did make a valid dedication at least a year ago and has given evidence of the fruitage of the spirit since that time. The one-year waiting period after baptism before one is eligible for servant responsibilities would not apply in</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">♦ Thus far only 154 applications for unassigned territory have been received by the Society. It appears that many more congregations could enjoy sharing in this work. Applications were sent with the April </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> You congregations that can arrange to do so and are giving good coverage to your regular territory should compare the current “List of Counties Assigned Since March, 1956” with the 1956 “Unassigned Territory in the United States” booklet, select your choices, and send us your applications immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">^Brothers and sisters between 18 and 35 years of age, single or married couples, in good health who are interested in Bethel service may make application at the coming district assemblies or by writing to the Society, President’s Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Applications should be renewed annually by written request. Always notify the Society of any change in information as to qualifications, work, health, draft classification and address. </span><span class="font10">this case, because the individual is not a newly converted man. Rather, it is a matter of being rebaptized either because he was living in an Improper condition at the time of his first baptism or because he had not really made a dedication with understanding before that baptism. See Questions from Readers in the December 15, 1956, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for further consideration of rebaptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> All baptismal candidates who can do so are encouraged to be baptized at a circuit, district or other assembly. However, occasionally it is necessary to have a local baptism between assemblies. This may be necessary for an invalid who is confined to home, or there may be other circumstances that make it expedient. In these cases a talk using the Society’s outline on dedication and baptism should be given, and the questions should be answered in the regular way. Then the congregation servant should report the number baptized on the monthly report card by inserting “Number baptized this month----” at the bottom of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">card. Do not include those rebaptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Having made a firm resolve to remain exclusively devoted to Jehovah, keep close to his organization and share regularly in its activities in order to grow strong in the faith. For all newly dedicated ones our prayer, like the apostle Paul’s, is that they will “walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as [they] go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.”</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What does purposeful witnessing mean? Keeping your mind focused on your objective. Not merely to place literature but to start a home Bible study—that is your objective. We are interested in lives, and the best way we can save lives is by bringing people into the “one flock” through the effective medium of Bible studies. How will it be possible to reach the goal of one new study per publisher?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The demonstration in “Your Service Meetings” on starting a study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book at the time of placing it shows that this method is reasonable, easy and purposeful. When the householder does not have time for a free demonstration, then what? Continue to witness purposefully by arranging for a back-call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Now this means making time for purposeful back-calls. Even if your weekday schedule is crowded, it can be done. How? </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Out of each week’s service activity, devote at least one hour to back-calls.</span><span class="font10"> Perhaps this hour will be on Sunday morning after your regular house-to-house work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Back-calls are now being made by about 62 percent of the publishers. Yet there are not this many conducting studies. About 41 percent are. What could be accomplished if this group of about 20 percent, or more than 42,000 publishers, could turn their back-calls into studies? If all back-calls are made with the objective clearly in mind, look what can happen: At one congregation of twenty-two publishers, after counsel by the circuit servant on purposeful back-calling, Bible studies rose from two to twenty-two!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Service meeting demonstrations are a great aid in purposeful witnessing. Observe them closely. Do still more. Practice the demonstration on starting a study with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font10"> book privately with another publisher. Since you learn best by doing, the practice session will be beneficial and enjoyable too. Charge yourself with the responsibility of practicing privately. Study conductors, show interest in these privatepractice sessions. Offer to help. During the month ask those associating with your service center and who do not have a home Bible study if they have practiced.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Make it your purpose to start a study at the time of placing the book. If the householder’s time is limited, be ready to arrange for a back-call. Then make it your aim to spend at least one hour a week on back-calls. Keep your objective in mind. That I is purposeful witnessing.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In these busy times our introductions should be to the point, enabling us to get into our sermon smoothly and quickly. With Bible ready, you may say : “I am making a call today to turn your thoughts for a moment from the everyday worries to something good we can have without worry. People usually have hopes of bettering their condition, but sickness, loss of jobs, war and like things often disturb our peace of mind. But this was not always so and it will not always be this way. You no doubt remember the good conditions God provided originally for Adam and Eve. Here at Genesis 2:15 .. .” (Continue with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font10">sermon.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We also want a smooth transition from the sermon to the book. After reading Revelation 21:3, 4, one might continue: “We are so used to imperfection that it is hard for us to imagine what living in a perfect world will be like. To help us visualize it God gave John this vision, just as though he could look ahead in time and see what was actually to take place. So that we can do this and see where we fit into the picture, the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font10"> [have it</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Are you ready to go? The first of the series of Awake Ministers District Assemblies for the United States is scheduled for this month of June. With twenty-two assemblies throughout the country, it should be convenient for all to be present. It is a God-given privilege to assemble with our brothers on these special occasions to receive the practical, strengthening and timely counsel that Jehovah has provided for us through his organization. We eagerly look forward to receiving these spiritual blessings and to having a share in the forceful public witness that such assemblies make possible. With the psalmist David we say to God: “I will laud you in the big congregation.”—Ps. 35:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If you expect to attend an assembly during June and have not yet sent in your room request, do so quickly available] looks right along the stream of time showing so plainly how paradise was lost, how it will be regained by God’s power, not man’s, how we can share in it and what it will be like.” (Turn to page 220, pars. 1, 2.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If the householder shows much impatience after your introduction or during your sermon and says: “I’m busy; get to the point,” or if he is about to turn away, have the book ready to present quickly, without a time-wasting pause. You may say: “This book will give you the full answer to the question about the hope of a righteous world of peace. It is yours for a contribution of only 75c.” Or: “Here is information that will enable you and your family to get a knowledge of how God will soon restore paradise to earth.” If the householder permits, you may show illustrations or statements in the book just as you would if you had given your whole sermon.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In making your plans to attend, bear in mind that this is a four-day assembly; you will not want to miss any of it. When planning car groups and making other preliminary arrangements, do not forget to include persons of good will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Attending one of these assemblies should be the most important thing on our program of summer activity. We live in a time when it is vital for each one to stay awake, benefiting from every provision made to keep us alert and active as ministers of God. Be sure to attend.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> What cause for rejoicing the members of the New World society residing in the United States do have! Our united efforts during the mouth of December resulted in a thunderous shout of praise to Jehovah's name and kingdom, the greatest number of persons ever personally brought in touch with the truth in one month and a new peak in publishers to the extent of realizing a 10.6-percent increase. And all that in spite of the month’s unusually severe weather. Our doing the divine will has brought joy to the heart of Jehovah and he has shown his approval by richly rewarding our, efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Just think what 223,600 witnesses means! It shows that not only did those of us who were present on that memwable Eriday afternoon, August 1, follow through in line with our resolve but that scores of thousands of others who were unable to be present also wanted to show where they stood by sharing in the distribution of that Resolution, thus truly making it their own. And what a privilege it was for each congregation publisher to personally present to one hundred persons its pointed, clear-cut, straightforward and Scriptural message, while pioneers were privileged to reach many more!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Extremely effective was our telling them that we would return to learn what they thought of it. As one Wyoming college woman told the vacation pioneer with whom she is studying, her acquaintances were reading and discussing the Resolution so as to be- able to have something to say about it upon our return. This drives home the obligation we have to call back and give them either the Kingdom sermon or the one on Earth as Man’s Home, thus giving them the opportunity to give their impression of the Resolution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The coupon at the end of the Resolution also served a very good purpose. It reused at least 3,016 persons to write for copies of the booklet containing the main talk of the Divine Will assembly. And note some of the comments received with these requests:</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Wbat a thrilling occasion it was, Friday afternoon. August 1, 1968, as 19-1,418 of u? resolved, among other things, to be at peace and unity among ourselves! Having made this resolve, let us now carry it our. How?

It may help us to keep going in spite of sub-zero weather if we do house-to-house work for a while and then make some back-calls; when you are warm again, go back to the house-to-honse work for a while.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Being fully familiar with our new sermon is most essential, But, above all, what is needed is a positive approach.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Being positive does not mean being overbearing: it means being resourceful, making the most of each situation. Especially does it mean being prepared to meet the two standard objections: Too busy I and Not interested !

<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">7 min: New World News report and “Plan for March and April.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">25 min: Develop and demonstrate a back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">PREPARING THE SERMON (15 min.) Show the necessity of having appropriate introductions on return calls. Then let the congregation develop the sermon under the chairman’s direction. It would be well to have the sermon outline on the platform. On completing the sermon discuss ways a study can be started by directing the householder’s attention to the publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theme: Earth to Become a Paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A suggested introduction: “Good evening, Mr. [or Mrs.] ----. Since my</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">last visit when we discussed the earth as man’s home I have talked to a number of other people who are interested in what the Bible says about it, just as you are. The subject is one that deserves close attention, so I have given the matter further study and have lined up some very interesting points. What the Bible says about the earth and the future of man upon it is very different from what a world filled with trouble would expect. The Bible fills us with hope; it shows how this earth will become a paradise. May I step in to discuss it with you? [On being invited in or if not invited in, proceed.] You will recall that in our last discussion we read scriptures from Revelation chapter 21 telling of the time when this earth will be a glorious place to live. Actually, this earth will become a paradise, because that is what God had in mind when he created the perfect man Adam and gave him a home in the garden of Eden. You will get more benefit from these texts I am going to read if you have your own Bible and follow in it. (Suggest householder get it.) Note the description the Bible gives of man's original home . .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. Man’s original home a paradise</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">4. God will remove those ruining earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rev. 11:18</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">— Isa. 11:6-9</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As a transition from the sermon.to the booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom” the publisher might say: “When we learn what God has in store for this earth and those who prove worthy of enjoying the paradise that will cover it, it gives us a bright outlook on the future, doesn’t it? It is the Kingdom we pray for when we say the Lord’s prayer that will bring this about. If we learn about it and prove our confidence in it now, we will be blessed with life in that new world. This booklet I left with you deals exclusively with the good news of that kingdom. If you will open your copy to page 3, I’ll illustrate how to gain the most from a study of it. Note the question . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">MODEL SERMON (8 min.) Prepared publisher will give model sermon, drawing householder into conversation and starting study in conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Encourage all to use this sermon when calling back on “Watchtower” subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Reading of the pioneer letter and enthusiastic talk on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Rom. 14:19] at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THIRD MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Experiences from 1959 “Yearbook” and local publishers on obtaining subscriptions. Chairman can arrange for different brothers to present “Yearbook” experiences as if each had received a letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We should not conclude too quickly that a person is not interested. In Hawaii a publisher obtained two subscriptions because she made more than one call on a person who appeared to be indifferent. (175) Some people may live in places that are difficult to reach but the effort made to bring the good news of the Kingdom to them often brings good results.: Three brothers in Canada placed twenty-two subscriptions because they made such an effort. (114) We should not hesitate to give our sermon and make the subscription offer when we are surprised to find a group of people gathered in the house where we have called. A publisher in Curasao did this when coming unexpectedly upon a meeting of the American Woman’s club. Two “Watchtower” subscriptions were obtained. (215) Some people would like to receive “The Watchtower” but do not have the full amount for a subscription and therefore decline the subscription. Let them pay on the installment plan. A sister in St. Vincent did this and obtained seventeen subscriptions in one month. (270) Make the subscription offer at every door and you too will have interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">12 min: Talk on proper handling of subscriptions and following through on subscription placements and promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">23 min: Demonstration on how to make practical use of tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Talks about the number of tracts we have and the subjects they cover. Many practical ways they can be used. Some publishers are not using them. Introduces two publishers who are discussing field activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE I (4 min.) Brother Mature remarks to Brother No Tracts about success he has had with tracts. Always carries some. Brother No Tracts confesses that he no longei’ carries them because he never used them when he did have them. Mature suggests that he may not realize their value and how to make practical use of them. Takes out all twelve tracts and points out some of the subjects they cover that are most, frequently discussed locally in the field. Points out some of the arguments contained in a few of them, stressing what a fine instrument the tracts are. Mature suggests that No Tracts come with him and watch some publishers make use of the tracts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE II (14 min.) Mature and No Tracts stand to one side watching a brother conclude a sermon and offer literature, but none is taken. Along with handbill he offers the tract “Life in a New World,” and makes a remark about the contents. Tract is accepted. (Mature comments about the scene to No Tracts and turns to watch another publisher.) After beginning sermon publisher is confronted with objection that witnesses do not believe in hell-fire. Householder is leaving and does not have time to discuss the subject. Publisher offers tract on hell-fire with the explanation: “This will briefly explain our position on the subject. I will call again and discuss it with you when you have more time.” (Mature comments to No Tracts that the tract was ideal for this situation. After a few more observations Mature points out witness who is speaking with a lady who says her baby is in the bath.) Publisher acknowledges that baby should not be left alone and offers th® tract “Man’s Only Hope for Peace.” Tells her he will call again when she is not so busy. (Mature comments on scene and turns to point out a schoolboy.) Boy is talking with a friend who is urging him to attend a school dance on the night of the service meeting. Young publisher declines, explaining that he must attend the service meeting and ministry school. He mentions why these are important to Jehovah’s witnesses. Friend wonders what Jehovah’s witnesses believe that they would put religion before pleasure. Publisher offers the tract “What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?” (Comments by Mature on how this was a practical use of a tract. Turns to watch final scene.) Theocratic housewife is talking to a salesman. As business is concluded she tells him she would like to give him something to read about the Scriptural significance of present-day world events. From a number of tracts lying on a table near the door she selects “Awake from Sleep!” and offers it to him. (Comments by Mature, with No Tracts agreeing, that the tracts can be used effectively. Says he will begin making practical use of them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) The tract you leave may kindle a spark of interest in Kingdom truths. Do not permit them to take the place of offering magazines. Use the magazines wherever possible, but remember that many times the tract is just what is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Gal. 6:10] at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOURTH MEETING IN FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 15 min: Report by “Watchtower” study servant on visit with congregation servant. Include suggestions on improving attendance and interest of study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things,” page 272, New World Living to Romans 1:22, 28, 29 on page 273. To be handled by audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Talk on “Be on Your Guard Against Impostors.” Show what true hospitality is and who are worthy of it. (See “Watchtower” 1/15/57, p. 49.) 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Visit with “Watchtower” Study Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Since </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> is the chief instrument used by the “faithful and discreet slave” to dispense food at the proper time, it is vital that we get full value from it. We must strive for an accurate knowledge of the truth. In addition to our private study of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font14">our understanding is greatly enlarged by our participation in the group study each week. It is the responsibility of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study servant to see that all in his congregation receive the greatest benefit from the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> During February the overseer will consider with the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study servant ways to improve the study and his teaching ability. First each should review </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font14"> (Studies 24 and 61) and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font14"> (paragraphs 127 and 136). At their meeting early in the month the nine points listed under Congregation Organization in the February, 1958, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> should be reviewed briefly. Their discussion should center around (1) how the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study can be improved so that the publishers receive the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan for March and April</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> This year we are looking forward to coming together to celebrate the Lord’s evening meal on Monday, March 23, after sundown. Now is the time to prepare. Servants should keep this date and its meaning before the congregation. In turn, the brothers will keep it before persons of good will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Each congregation should now arrange for the public talk “The Perfect Government for All Mankind,” to be given April 5. This subject will be the title of the study article in the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> Each congregation will receive a copy m ample time, but now is the time to assign as the speaker one who is a good reader and who can present the material with feeling; then send off your order for handbills. Also remember to order plenty of extra copies of the April 15 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> which is to have extraordinary distribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If we do our utmost, we can look for a 20-percent increase in April, which is 242,569! We are assured of Jehovah’s blessing. The rest is up to us to make April a peak month in the number of ministers, in the number of magazines distributed and in the number of new Bible studies started. greatest benefit from it, and (2) the servant’s teaching ability and support of service arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Although there is much weighty material to cover in an hour at the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> study, this can be done without difficulty if the servant and those in the congregation prepare ahead. If the lesson is quite long, only a few comments can be entertained on one question. The material should be divided into four fairly equal parts and the servant can check himself to see if he fs covering each part in about fifteen minutes. The study itself should not last more than one hour. Songs, prayer and announcements should not be more than a total of ten minutes. If the time is properly apportioned, he will not be spending more time on the first part of the lesson and then be required to rush through the last part in order to finish on time. Publishers should be encouraged to prepare ahead and share in commenting regularly. Also, publishers should be sure to bring their copies of the Bible so that scriptures may be looked up, remembering that this is a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The overseer and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study servant should plan to work together in the field ministry several times during the month, with the congregation servant giving suggestions for improving the servant’s teaching ability. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">study servant should be a good teacher of others and should be working closely with a service center in training others.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">■O Resolutions. Any pioneers or congregations having Resolutions left over should immediately distribute these from house to house or to persons on the street or in the regular door-to-door witnessing activity. Be sure that all copies of the Resolutions are distributed and in the hands of the people by the end of February. Any extra copies held by publishers should be distributed right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Correction on Ministry School Schedule: First Scripture reading for March 15 should be Neh. 7: 66 to 8:8, instead of Neh. 7: 6 to 8: 8.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be on Your Guard Against Impostors</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> These are critical times when sheeplike brothers must keep their senses and be watchful. Paul warns us against “false brothers.” He further says that “by smooth talk and complimentary speech they seduce the hearts of guileless ones.” These strangers usually have a smooth sad story and just want to borrow a few dollars to tide them over. Peter states: “They have a heart trained in covetousness. They are accursed children.”—2 Cor. 11: 26; Rom. 16: 18; 2 Pet. 2:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> So be on your guard against such worthless, wicked men. They are professional swindlers, cheats, spongers, beggars, corrupt men seeking their own advantage. Their methods may vary, but they almost always end up on the same note— money—something for nothing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> These impostors usually begin with a long, sad, hard-luck story. They claim to be away from home, sick, even hospitalized. They want immediate attention. They say their mother or father has died. They need fare money. Some want food money, clothing money, but it is always money. Other impostors may ask for a home Bible study. After they think they have gained your confidence, they will begin to deal, slyly with material things. They need things, household necessities </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font14"> even an automobile. Their favorite line is—you can trust me. Be on your guard against such wolves in sheep’s clothing, brothers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Ask yourselves, When have brothers ever begged? (Ps. 37: 25) Brothers prefer to go without than to beg for things. When they work hard in speaking and teaching, the brothers see their good works and generously provide and this without their having to beg for it. Know those whom you assist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We do not want to stifle Christian hospitality because of a few cheats that sneak into our midst. Let us continue to be generous with our brothers who are in need and who are working hard in the Lord’s service but cautious with strangers. Learn to differentiate between the sheep and the goats.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To Those Who Say, “I have more magazines than I can read”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> As we present the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font14">subscription offer, householders respond with many excuses. One of the most common is, “I have more magazines than I can read.” This is often true, so it does no good to tell them they need more. You have to show the urgent necessity of selecting the best. You might say: “I agree. It’s like so many other things we see advertised. We can’t use them all. So we select what fills our needs best. What reading material helps you to know the Scriptural principles for g happy household? What magazine brings the optimistic view of a righteous new world where we can live in real happiness with our families? I have found that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> gives me the spiritual help I need to meet the problems of today successfully. For example, here in this issue . . .” (Turn to an interesting point.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Or you could say: “Yes, magazines generally inform us as to what is taking place and emphasize what men are thinking and planning. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> fills a different purpose for you. It view’s things from the more important standpoint of what God thinks and does as he watches</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintaining Theocratic Unity </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font14">think will most likely appeal to that particular householder and elaborate on it. The magazine-territory servant can be of much help in this regard if he will pass on to the publishers good talking points on the new magazines when they get their supplies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Offer the subscription at every cjoor. Do not prejudge the householder. Only in this way can we expect to meet our quotas. Where subscriptions are not obtained, be sure to offer the two latest magazines for 10c. The brothers are doing very well in meeting and exceeding their magazine quotas; only the special pioneers are not reaching theii’ quota of 150. Keep up the good work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Exercise care when filling out the subscription slip. Print the name and address and do not overlook the zone number. Indicate the language if other than English. See that the householder carefully reads each line of the address on the slip before from his lofty position.” (Turn to “The Purpose of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower.”')</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Others will narrow the objection to religious literature by saying, “I have my own' religious magazines.” Y'ou may reply: “Then you are in a position to appreciate the value of literature as an aid to Bible study. You know’, there are hundreds of religious magazines. Yet if you carefully examine them you will find this magazine alone in the field of announcing God’s kingdom government as the only hope for a world of peace.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In reasoning as suggested above, you can point out that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> is the most widely read religious magazine on earth. (Also see </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers,</span><span class="font14"> pages 205. 206.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In summary : Briefly show’ there is more than the usual value in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> then quickly demonstrate by calling attention to a striking point in the magazine.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">initialing it. Congregations should send in all subscriptions </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">each week </span><span class="font14">after they have been carefully checked by the overseer for clarity and completeness. When you place a subscription, always inform the householder that it will be </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">about a month</span><span class="font14"> until their copies arrive through the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>s</sup> During February we also want to stress our third goal for this service year: acquainting newly interested ones with the theocratic organization by bringing them to meetings. It would be a fine thing for book study conductors to discuss with their groups who there is in their territory that could be assisted to attend meetings and how to go about doing it. Offer to call for them. It is far better to say “Come!” than to say “Go!” Practical suggestions will be found in Study 55 in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font14"> In all such ways we will be carrying out our resolve to be at peace and unity.</span></p>

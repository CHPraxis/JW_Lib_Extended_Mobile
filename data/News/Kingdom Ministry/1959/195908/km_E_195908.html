<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Loyal Love We Owe to God!</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It is a grand thing that we can express loyal love to Jehovah and his Kingdom Heir. What a powerful expression of our loyal love is faithfulness In Kingdom ministry I Such an expression we owe to God. “Loyal love,” declares the psalmist, “belongs to you, O Jehovah, for you yourself pay back to each one according to his work.”—Ps. 62 :12, margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> August offers many opportunities to make expression of our loyal love. Be well prepared with the new sermon, giving it whenever you can. Those who are report fine results. From Massachusetts a brother reports giving the sermon at most doors and making good placements of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be bone on Earth” </span><span class="font11">—this in strong Catholic territory. A district servant writes from Louisiana: “I was able to place six books this morning.” From North Carolina comes this report: “I was able to place three books in four calls on Sunday.” From Pennsylvania: “During part of Saturday and for a short time on Sunday I used the sermon and placed eight.” From Ohio: “Five books placed in one and a half hours, with the sermon given in its entirety every time.” Use the sermon and enjoy rich blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Those of good will who hear your sermon will be interested in the Bible-study aid </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth.”</span><span class="font11"> By pointing to the Scripture index let the householder know that the book thoroughly discusses Daniel’s prophecy. Explain that this prophecy was “shut up and sealed till the time of the end.” (Dan. 12:9) Now this remarkable prophecy can be understood. Let the householder know that Daniel foretold the rise of world communism and the outcome of the present struggle for global domination. With those who take the book leave a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font11"> It is an effective aid in starting a home Bible study. With Catholic people leave </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“God’s Wag Is Love.”</span><span class="font11"> When the book is not taken, have a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> ready. Point to the article “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” Invite the householder to read a portion of the thrilling book by taking </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> on a 10c contribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> After placing the book, make your return calls within a few days, if possible, and continue </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font11"> express loyal love by perseverance in calling back on these good-will persons. Those who show loyal love do not give up easily. Loyal love is the kind that lovingly attaches itself to the object of the loving-kindness and sticks to him w’ith a loyalty that will not let go until the worthy purpose of that loyal love has been</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one booklet for 50c. J</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">| THEME FOR AUGUST | (Expressing Loyal Love to God and HisJ | Kingdom Heir.—Ps. 62:12, margin.(</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">realized. Do you express this kind of loyal love when making back-calls? If something has happened to make a householder cool, our perseverance in calling back may clear up the situation and kindle the desire for a home Bible study. Any publisher who does not yet have a home Bible study should rehearse the demonstration on starting a study. Do it privately. Let book study conductors co-operate, seeing that publishers have someone to help them in these practice sessions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We show loyal love this month, too, by working our unassigned territory thoroughly. Holding public meetings in such territory is a further expression of loyal love. Congregations with no unassigned territory should concentrate on their territory that may not be as thoroughly worked as some. Not-at-homes are sometimes neglected territory because publishers do not call back at a different time. Make Sunday not-at-homes, for example, during prestudy activity, or use the midweek contact for this purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> By the end of August all congregations will have attended a district assembly. Upon returning, continue to express loyal love. Call on good-will persons to tell them of the assembly blessings. You could use the printed program of the Awake Ministers District Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses as the basis for a back-call sermon. Acquaint persons with whom you study with the importance of attending assemblies. After your congregation has attended one of the district assemblies, be sure to devote an entire service meeting to reviewing the assembly program in the light of congregational circumstances, as suggested in the July </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> Bring your good-will persons to this meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Many are the ways to express loyal love. From house to house express it by giving the new sermon and by showing the unusual benefits of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth.” </span><span class="font11">Express it by perseverance in making back-calls to start studies. Express it by dependability in conducting studies. Express it by giving unassigned territory a good coverage. Express it by seeing that no territory belonging to your congregation can be called neglected—not even the not-at-homes. Express it by telling others of the happiness that comes from being awake ministers. Our time and energy expended in these expressions of loyal love are not in vain, for Jehovah obligates himself to “pay back to each one according to his work.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Show loyal love to God and to the brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Expressing Loyal Love to God and His Kingdom Heir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7 min: </span><span class="font10">“New World News” and announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Talk on “Expressing Loyal Love to God and His Kingdom Heir.” (See “Watchtower” 12/1/58, p. 720, and 8/1/59, p. 478.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Yearbook” experiences on using back-call sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A brother who asks another brother if he really thinks back-call sermons are effective has his question answered by the brother pointing to examples from the “Yearbook.” A publisher in Hawaii who called back on a person found that she listened attentively to the sermon and agreed to a Bible study. (174) A publisher in Bolivia called back on a person although no literature was placed. By means of back-call sermon a study was started. (104) The caretaker of a church was convinced to accept the truth after a number of back-call sermons. (107) Back-call sermons can be very effective for those who make the effort to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">25 min; </span><span class="font10">Develop and demonstrate back-call sermon. A competent brother should be used as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Many in territory have eagerly obtained new book “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” Chairman points out privilege we have in making return visits to help spiritually hungry learn divine will. New back-call sermon simple, practical and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(11 min.) Discussion with audience. Chairman may have sermon outline on platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THEME: What God's Will Means for Mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A suggested introduction: “Good evening, [use name]. On my last visit we discussed some interestingscriptures on God’s will to make this earth a place of peace filled with happy people. I have made it a point to look up some additional scriptures showing that God’s will for earth means a happy future for this generation. May I step in and show them to you? [Wait to be invited in, or, if not, continue.] The last time we read scriptures from the Bible book of Isaiah showing it is God’s will for man to live in peace and happiness on earth. In another chapter this same prophet paints this beautiful word picture of what things will be like.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Effects of God’s will being done on earth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 11: 6-9</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Righteous ruler to enforce God’s will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 9: 6, 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God’s will to be done on earth in our time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 24: 32-34</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Opposers of God’s will destroyed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">—Ps. 37: 9-11</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Our mind must be renewed to do will of God &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rom. 12; 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A suggested conclusion: “Our minds can be renewed by taking in information about God’s will. The booklet that I left with you entitled ‘This Good News of the Kingdom’ clearly shows from the Scriptures what God’s kingdom will mean for mankind and also helps us to renew our mind to do God’s will. Let me demonstrate how it win help you. Please turn to page</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Model sermon by prepared publisher. Householder should be brought into discussion, showing the art of teaching. In conclusion study is started in “This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman encourages all to make return visits and to use this effective sermon. Be alert to start studies, which will be the means of aiding others to learn God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Awake Ministers Work to Average 10 Percent.” 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. </span><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font10">“Make Sure of All Things,” on New-World Living from page 276, “Closeness of Family Relationship in Congregation,” to 1 Peter 2:21 on page 277. To be handled as a talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Assigning and Covering Territory” under Congregation Organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Demonstration on “How to Study ‘The Watchtower.’ ” To be handled by the “Watchtower” study servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TALK (3 min.) “Watchtower” study servant speaks on need of more study. To be teachersr we must understand truth ourselves, become mature, qualified to teach. Spiritual discernment essential. Personal study fundamental, foundation of lives of Christian ministers. Study, properly done, fixes material in mind for future use. How to study “Watchtower” is problem of many. Some publishers have asked for instruction and their questions will be answered before audience for benefit of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">DEMONSTRATION (14 min.) “Watchtower” study servant talks with three publishers who have asked for instruction on how to study for better understanding and so they will be able to comment more freely. First requirement, he explains, is to study with a purpose: to gain an accurate understanding for own benefit and so as to teach others. One publisher asks if scriptures should be looked up in lesson. Servant definitely encourages this. Make sure you get the understanding of the illustrations also. Think of connection material being studied has with your worship of Jehovah and fulfilling ministry. One ' publisher a.sks, “Could you show us how to do this?” Servant gives each a copy of July 1 “Watchtower” and tells them to turn to study lesson for August 23. (Audience should have their copies and look on.) To illustrate need for resisting desire of flesh, desire of eyes and showy display of one’s means of life, paragraph two gives example of Jesus when tempted by Satan. They discuss how various points apply, how the counsel is of benefit to themselves and how it could best be explained to newly interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Publisher who finds it difficult to answer in “Watchtower” study asks for additional help. Servant answers that marking answers may assist. Sister replies she does underline. Servant invites her to show what she would underline in reply to question on paragraph 10. She points out whole sentences she would underline. Best to underline only key words or phrases, servant remarks. For example, one might underline “could not do that work” and “fear” as answer to first part of question. For second half of question key words might be “does not have faith” or “knowledge.” These form outline for eye to catch and follow when answering question at study. (If time allows, examples from succeeding paragraphs might also be used.) Another help is to review. After having studied, look at questions and see if you can answer from memory. If points not clear in mind, briefly glance at key phrases. (Illustrate from paragraphs discussed.) Publishers appreciate assistance and will put information to use in future study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TALK (3 min.) “Watchtower” study servant sums up points made in demonstration. Suggests, in studying, if entire lesson cannot be covered at one time, then take just three or four paragraphs at time until lesson finished. Concentration also essential. Do not try to do other work, or think about things undone when studying. Students who get most from study become most effective teachers in helping others. Make best use of study time, study with a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Ps. 37:31] at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FOURTH MEETING IN AUGUST 5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: A talk on “Yearbook” expediences about meeting magazine quotas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The quota of twelve magazines, a month is not difficult for a congregation publisher to meet. It means only three magazines a week. An elderly sister in New Caledonia places up to twenty-two magazines each time she goes into the field service. (93) A sister in Cuba easily surpasses her quota by having a magazine route. (136) A special pioneer in Tobago felt that a quota of 150 magazines a month was too low. He chose to set a personal quota. (271) In Martinique a pioneer has no difficulty meeting the pioneer quota of 100 magazines a month by offering copies to truck drivers. (170) The respective quotas are being met and exceeded by many publishers. Others can do the same by making an effort to place the magazines and by being alert to opportunities to increase their placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage on article “Are You Placing the Magazine Quota?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk on “How We Can Improve Our Magazine Placements Locally.” Magazine-territory servant will handle this portion. He will allow time for a discussion of this matter with congregation and work out arrangements for more to share in magazine service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each one should faithfully carry his “own load of responsibility” in checking out a territory assignment.—Gal. 6 : 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In the congregation the magazine-territory servant is responsible to issue the territory and see that it is all covered properly. Study conductors should check out only what they need for group witnessing, returning this in the regular way for checking out again or to get other open territory in the vicinity of the service center. The study conductor will assign those sharing in group witnessing certain sections to work, and they are responsible to make the not-at-home calls and follow up all interest located.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> While it is recommended that publishers cover territory near their homes and the service center they attend, the territory is not to be subdivided into sections for the respective service centers. Publishers are not to be restricted from obtaining open territories in other sections of the congregation assignment, especially if that territory is not frequently worked by the group in that area and it is not needed as nearby territory for that group.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Starting September 6 circuit servants will give the new public talk “Walking Wisely in a Wicked World.” At circuit assemblies district servants will give the public talk “When Is God’s Will to Be Done on Earth?” beginning in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O An actual-count inventory of literature is to be taken by all congregations on September 1. Two Literature Inventory forms are being sent to each congregation. The original should be sent to the Society </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not later than September 3</span><span class="font10"> and the duplicate retained for the congregation files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">^•“Your Will Be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Done on Earth”:</span><span class="font10"> The book is now available, in English only, but the same information is being published in a series of articles in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> in almost all languages. Questions are included. Congregations having congregation book studies in languages other than English may wish to use the material appearing in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> series for regular study when they complete the book that is now being used. Each article can be divided in half and thus there would be material for two weeks’ study. Provided that issues for at least six months of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> (semimonthly editions) containing the series have already been published, each congregation may use the material and make up its own schedule for study.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In some congregations there may be a shortage of territory. Here it may be necessary for the book study conductors to hold most if not all the territory and assign certain blocks or apartment houses to publishers so that all have a share in service and the work is done systematically. Emphasis should be placed on a thorough coverage each time, with a good record being kept. Where such a territory shortage exists, publishers might seriously consider moving where the need is great. In other congregations territory is not covered very frequently. Attention should be given to building up support for service so that the congregation is covering its territory every four months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Then, in most congregations there are sections that are covered more often than others. The congregation servant, magazine-territory servant and the study conductors should co-operate to give a systematic coverage to all the territory with both magazines and the regular offer. The records on territory coverage should be kept up to date. Working orderly, let us unitedly extend the witness into every home in our assignment.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Are You Placing the Magazine Quota?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The magazine activity is a very important part of the Kingdom ministry and one in which we in the United States are doing very well —as groups. Special pioneers, whose quota is 150 a month, are averaging 147; regular pioneers, with a quota of 100, are placing 107 monthly, and congregation publishers are exceeding their quota, placing 12.3. The group picture is good, but what about us individually?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Here there is room for improvement. Circuit servant reports show that the majority of congregation publishers are not meeting their quota. Let us build up our appreciation by carefully reading each issue of each magazine from cover to cover.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Magazine work is easy and pleasant. Low placements may be due to lack of Magazine Day service </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">from service centers.</span><span class="font11"> Congregation servants, give this matter attention. If capable brothers are lacking to take the lead, let capable sisters be used. Also, while house-to-house magazine service is most effective for following through, street work still has beneficial results, particularly if publishers take the initiative by approaching shoppers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If for some reason you cannot engage in magazine work on the congregation’s magazine day, why not have your own magazine day? Get an individual magazine territory and work in it each week. This can be any day except Sunday. The important thing is regularity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Keeping our magazine presentation brief will also help. A good 30- to 60-second presentation, if made in a warm, friendly, positive and enthusiastic manner, is usually the most effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Let’s all enthusiastically encourage one another to improve our Magazine Day activity. Family groups should work on it together. Training program companions should include it in their schedule.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Placing “Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The new sermon has aroused much interest in the doing of God’s will on earth. To feed that interest further we need a strong, appealing conclusion to get people to take the book and read it. Here are conclusions that have been found effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> ‘The long-prayed-for will of God is to be accomplished soon, in this very “space age,” as this book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font11"> proves from the most reliable authority. The first paragraph announces what to expect as you read the book. [Read p. 5, par. 1.] It will help you and your family to be among those faithful survivors.’ (Offer book and booklet for 50c contribution.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> ‘You see from what we have read that the Bible shows that what we see happening in the earth is not God’s will for mankind. God has provided his kingdom as the means by which his will is to be done on earth. By knowing what God’s will for the earth really means we come to have a great desire to see it done and to start doing it ourselves now. This book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font11"> helps us avoid a lawless course contrary to God’s will, as it states here . . (Read p. 364, par. 13.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Awake Ministers Work</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Awake ministers need not. be told that with August comes the summer’s heat and thoughts of vacations, beaches and picnics that capture the mind. Awake ministers know, too, that there is a tendency to want to relax and take it easy during warm summer days. And almost before one is aware of it August can pass without our reporting an hour of praise to Jehovah’s name. Certainly we could not be considered awake ministers if we let this happen to us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To prevent this from happening to you, schedule now your service program for the month of August and stick to it. Be determined to go out in the service, whether you go on vacation or stay at home. If away from the congregation, mail your report each week to the con-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> ‘While East and West are trying to settle whose will is to be done, serious-minded persons want to make the wise decision in harmony with the prayer that God’s will be done on earth. With this book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font11"> you can confidently make that right decision. How does it help? Notice here . . .’ (Read p. 31, par. 50.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> ‘Today’s troubles warn us we are at the time for world change. What will that change mean for us? The Bible tells us. This book shows that the Bible accurately foretold the world powers of the past. [ Show picture on p. 104.] It even foretold the clash of armies in both World War I and World War II, as in this chapter. [Show picture, p. 264.] We can therefore rely on its accuracy in foretelling the perfect world in which God’s will shall be done, as the remaining chapters of the book explain. It is yours for a contribution of 50c.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Our desire is to average a 10-percent increase for the service year. To stimulate activity during August, each congregation should arrange for special midweek contacts. Encourage school children, vacationers and all to support them. Bear in mind that being an awake publisher in August means to be an active one. Report your activity. Press forward for a 10-percent average increase for the service year. Exert yourselves vigorously to the end that we may all say as did David : Jehovah “you have crowned the year with your goodness.”—Ps. 65:11.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a privilege to serve the interests of God’s perfect government I Paul treasured it so highly that even in confinement he was busy “preaching the kingdom of God.” We should imitate Paul. —Acts 28: 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> April is a month of special activity. April 5 should be a day for special service in all congregations. Let’s strive to help every publisher to be out in the field service April 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Make full use of the special talk and special issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> to aid new ones to serve the Kingdom interests. All publishers should plan to attend the special talk on April 5, bringing with them good-will persons. Did you help others to attend Memorial ? Help these same persons and others to attend the special talk. After the talk the congregation should have the April 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> available for distribution. Announce it at the close of the public meeting. Offer five for 15c: ten for 30c, inviting good-will persons to share in the distribution. Publishers can help their good-will persons get a supply. Promptly after the April </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">5 </span><span class="font11">talk overseers should mail the Memorial report card to the Society.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Work for New Magazine Peak</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How grand it will be if we all reach new individual peaks in magazine placements! Think how many more good-will persons will learn of God’s perfect government! Read the special issues as soon as you receive them. You will be stirred to offer them enthusiastically at every home. Since placements depend to a great extent on saying the right thing at the door, have in mind appealing presentations when you go in the service. What quota have you set for April so as to reach a new peak personally?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Have you laid definite plans to expand your magazine ministry during April? It means spending more time in that feature of service. Take advantage of all opportunities to place magazines: on your regular Magazine Day, before the congregation book study, and in incidental witnessing. In regular house-to-house work when the subscription offer is not accepted, offer two magazines for 10c. Parents may be able to go with their children in magazine work after school at least, once a week. Spend your time in the fea-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Serving the Interests of God’s Perfect Government.” (See “Watchtower,” 4/1/59, p. 211.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min; “Yearbook” experiences about expansion in Kingdom service. The brothers in Japan are being blessed with good fruitage. (191) In Poland an increase of 100 percent in Bible study activity has contributed to rapid growth of the New World society. (130) Hard work by six missionaries in Brazil produced a congregation of fifty publishers within two years. Thirteen of these applied for vacation pioneering last April. (106) In Nicaragua a circuit servant had to travel by horse, oxcart and on foot to reach a place where the brothers had been working with good results. (220) Norway reports a marked expansion of the New World society because brothers are going where the need is great. One family reports that a congregation of ten publishers has resulted from their work. (228) Diligent effort produces fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Question-and-answer discussion of main article “Serve the Interests of God’s Perfect Government.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Talk by congregation servant on “Things We Want to Do This Month.” (Encourage all publishers to do more than usual service. Include comment on statement based on Col. 4: 11 at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Talk on “1959 Public Meetings.” Encourage all to attend regularly and bring good-will persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">24 min: </span><span class="font10">Demonstration on “Helping Those Needing Help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Congregation servant talks on prospects for reaching 20-percent goal in congregation. Requires all-out effort. Excellent suggestions given in March “Kingdom Ministry” for helping those with whom studies are conducted, but what about irregular and less mature publishers? Study conductors and mature publishers aiding many; would appreciate suggestions for aiding certain publishers. Audience can assist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Study conductor called to platform tells of problem he has with Sister “Sickly” who always says she is not feeling well when invited to share in service. How can he help her?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Audience invited to suggest practical ways they know to help her or to relate experiences others have had in similar circumstances. If audience does not cover same points, servant may add: Recognize illness exists; may not do as much as others but can share in some features of service; doing divine will most important work in life whether well or ill; taking deep interest in good-will persons can take mind off illness, etc. If illness confines to home, she can write letters to goodwill persons or call them on phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Servant asks Sister Mature </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">state problem she is having with Sister “Minnie Problems.” Tells that Sister Problems has four children and unbelieving husband, says she “just can’t go in service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(5 min.) Audiencte given opportunity to offer practical suggestions in same manner as above. Additional points by servant, if not covered by audience, might be: At midweek contacts sisters can mutually assist one another by taking turns caring for young children; could take one child in service while husband cares for others; be example of devotion to Jehovah, serving him means eternal life for children as well as parent; no greater heritage for children than ministry; better home organization may help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1 min.) Brother “Weary” raises hand, asks for suggestions for himself. He is just too weary to go in service when he returns from hard day’s work. Unbelieving family consumes time on Sunday, since this is only time he has with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Servant answers: Proper to care for family. Many brothers have financial burdens. Task may be difficult, but devoting all time to old world, none to new, unsafe course. May be assuming greater load than necessary. Warning found in rich young ruler. (Matt. 19) Also, fighting one’s conscience can wear one out mentally, physically. Tired, worn-out feeling often gone when service finished. As head of family, take lead; family can benefit from good example of faithfulness and regular worship. Audience invited to comment or give practicable experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Congregation servant admonishes congregation to help those needing help to be active in April and regular in the months ahead. Assistance to one another will make April peak month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Experiences from 1959 “Yearbook” about youthful determination to pioneer. A young brother in Australia chose pioneer service even when his opposing parents gave him the choice between Jehovah’s service and his material inheritance. (89) A brother of thirteen in Peru showed such determination to vacation pioneer that his parents gave up in trying to stop him. (236) A yotmg girl in Burma whose father is a Hindu prepared to leave home to pioneer in spite of her father’s violent opposition. But because she is a minor and lawfully subject to him she has had to postpone it until’ she is of age; then she will fulfill her heart’s desire. (Ill) If you are a youthful publisher do you have the same determination to pioneer as these young publishers have?</span></p>

A panel of three to five publishers is asked to come to platform to help congregation become familiar with striking points in April 15 and April 22 special issues. All publishers should have copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (8 min.) Chairman quizzes panel on April 15 “Watchtower.” Questions should be confined to two or three articles and directed to bring out practical points that would be of interest to householders and could be used at conclusion of 3- to 8-minute sermon when making subscription offer or on Magazine Day.

<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (10 min.) Chairman now quizzes panel on April 22 “Awake!” Follow same procedure as outlined above to highlight points of interest that can be used effectively in field ministry. Do not overlook the value of illustrations in magazines to rouse interest in the articles.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At strategic locations throughout the territory of each congregation there should be sufficient book study locations to accommodate the publishers and persons of good will conveniently. For them to operate efficiently the book study conductor must be quick to apply the suggestions given for improving his work and becoming a better teacher of the Word.

<p><span class="font10">♦ Notice: Material to be covered in the April 5 public talk is on pages 228 to 243 in the April 15 “Watchtower.” With the summer rapidly approaching, now is the time to plan to vacation pioneer. School vacation furnishes opportunity for all younger brothers and sisters of school age who are dedicated to vacation pioneer two or more months. Many older ones who have Scriptural obligations that now make regular pioneering out of reach also look forward to vacation pioneering at every opportunity. Why not spend your vacation this year as a vacation pioneer? Provision has been made for even those who have but two weeks’ vacation to enjoy this service. Make your plans to vacation pioneer now and write for an application.</span></p>

Show how the question can be broken down, where necessary, if there are several points; how supplementary questions may be asked to clarify an answer that may not have been correctly or clearly stated; how scriptures cited but not quoted can be applied effectively, etc. The important thing is to have publishers express the thoughts so that it is evident that they understand the material and that the points are impressed upon the mind.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Public meetings play a large and vital role in preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom. The new series of talks for 1959 will begin on Sunday, April 12. The titles are: Is This Existence All There Is to Life? Will Many Now Living Never Die? Is the Bible a Man-made Book or a Divine Guide? Is Jesus Christ the Promised Messiah? Identifying the True God. What Can Prayer Do for You? Why Are There So Many Religions? How to Guard Your Children from Delinquency.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Every publisher plays a very important part at the public meetings. Always strive to be present, and try to bring new ones along with you. You learn by hearing new ideas and new ways of expressing Kingdom truths. Many brothers find that they get more out of the talks when they follow along with their Bibles and take moderate notes so they can later give a brief resume to any good-will persons who may not be present. At public meetings publishers should introduce themselves to newly interested ones and aid by answering questions that they may have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Speakers should follow the Society’s outline closely when developing their talks. This will aid them to present a well-rounded-out, coherent, logical talk. The best speakers make their talks very simple, striving mainly for clarity and understandableness. Good talks take many hours of hard work to prepare. So, brothers, support the new public meeting series.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Where to Assemble &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">gregations. The rooming instructions are attached to each request form and these should be carefully taken up in a service meeting about six weeks prior to the convention you expect to attend. Do not send request forms earlier than six weeks before assembly date for city where you expect to attend. Assembly dates and correct addresses for each convention city headquarters are listed on the back of request form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Badges</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> You may advertise the “Awake Ministers Assemblies” en route to convention city by using the attractive card prepared by the Society to fit holder that you used last year. Cards and additional celluloid holders should be ordered by the congregation servant. He should ascertain the needs for the congregation and then submit a cashitem order for them. The cards will cost 1c each and the celluloid holders, 5c each. The Society is not providing bumper signs this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the April 15 “Watchtower”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We have the only message of real comfort for distressed people —the message of the Kingdom government—in the special April 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Those who want to live need this information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In making the presentation one approach might be: “Good morning. My call this morning is to bring you some unusually good news. It answers the question, Does God really care and will he do something for mankind? In this special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> the article ‘The Perfect Government for All Mankind’ explains just what God will do for mankind. [Open to article.] This copy you may have, together with its companion magazine </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> on a contribution of only ten cents.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A new publisher may say : “Good morning. I have called to present to you a special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> with its companion </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">Millions of these are being distributed ’ in fifty-four languages. ‘The Perfect Government for All Man</span></p></li></ul>

If your congregation has already made the 20-percent increase, maintain it during April. If other persons are ready for service, do not fail to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Aiding Irregular Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’Assistant congregation servants should support study conductors by giving them each week a list of publishers who have not been out. Give these publishers special help. Individual publishers can co-operate by volunteering their services to the study conductor. Circumstances may make it difficult for certain ones to go out on weekends, possibly leading to irregularity. Lovingly find out when they can go in the service and offer to go with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Parents will want to see that their children are out in April. Teaching and training children is primarily the responsibility of the parents, not the congregation. However, parents should feel free to discuss the matter with the servants. kind’ is the main subject of this issue, as you see. These two magazines are yours for only ten cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* Using the article “The Perfect Ruler for Mankind” one might say : “I am calling to bring a practical answer to a question millions of people ask today. For centuries Christians have prayed for Christ's kingdom. But how and when will he bring it about, and what conditions will result for us on earth? On page 241 [par. 16] wonderful conditions are described. [Let householder see.] Only the perfect Ruler, with all power in heaven and earth, can bring this. You may have this magazine and its companion </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">for a contribution of just ten cents.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Some parents may wish to co-operate among themselves so They and their children can be regular. If you have definite arrangements for your children to be in the service </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each week, </span><span class="font11">then not even bad weather will cause them to become irregular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> April climaxes the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">subscription campaign. Have you reached your quota? If not, there is still time. Make April a big month of house-to-house work with the subscription offer. Call back on all promises and on subscription expiration slips with the special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> When turning in subscription slips, be sure they are easy to read. Congregation servants, do not allow difficult-to-read slips to be sent to the Society. Make out new ones. It is true that the subscriber’s initials will not be on the new slip, but accuracy and legibility are more important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Reaching our 20-percent goal depends on the co-operation of every one of us. Do your utmost to serve the interests of God’s perfect government. We look forward to receiving your congregation April field service report with “We made it!” written on the card.</span></p>

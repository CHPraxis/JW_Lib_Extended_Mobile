<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Show Appreciation by Extending and Peopling It</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> With what happiness our New World society overflows! And no wonder, with the spiritual garden of Jehovah flourishing on every hand. Look ! the many new Kingdom Halls springing up! See the new Bethel homes, branch offices and printing plants I Above all, note the ever-increasing light of truth and the number of dwellers in our spiritual paradise! Truly today Jehovah’s Edenic prophecies, such as, “I will plant upon you a large population,” are having striking fulfillment.—Ezek. 36:10, .47'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> What a privilege is ours to be God’s co-workers by extending and peopling our spiritual paradise! And what better instrument could we have than our new book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained? </span><span class="font8">How delightful this book is! How attractive, how appealingly it is bound! How aptly, beautifully and profusely it is illustrated! How easily it reads! How understandably it presents the truth of God’s Word! And how eagerly all of us have been looking forward to the privilege of using it in our regular house-to-house ministry ever since we first laid eyes upon it on that Thursday afternoon, July 31, at our Divine Will assembly !</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> With the utmost confidence we can say to each householder: ‘This is a book that will warm your heart: one that you will enjoy reading. It is a book you can readily understand. It reveals our loving heavenly Father as He really is and it will give you a strong, bright hope regarding the future.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Because of its appealing- landing, theme and contents this book practically places itself. Thus one brother met the objection “I’m a Catholic” by turning at once to the book and briefly commenting on its illustrations. The man forgot all about his being a Catholic and readily obtained the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> For presenting </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> we have a new sermon outlined under “Your Service Meetings.” After giving the sermon show how the various illustrations tie in with the texts you have read. If at all possible, try to start a study at the very time you first place the book. If unable to do this, obligate yourself to call back by setting a definite date for your return call. If interrupted in your sermon, turn at once to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font8">book and try to continue your sermon from it.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Every </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> placement is a potential home Bible study. During the length of this campaign, two months, every publisher should be able to start at least one new study in this book. Special and regular pioneers and congregation publishers have been doing well in improving their study averages. Now, using the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> book, surely all of us can reach our respective goals of ten, seven and one home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> Paradise</span><span class="font8"> is a book not merely for adults but for young folks, as letters to the Society so clearly show. However, it should be of great aid to our younger publishers in starting home Bible studies with others of their age. Time and again these have resulted in parents’ coming into the truth. One publisher of thirteen is conducting a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> study at which as high as fifteen and never less than four take part. One elevenyear-old lad is doing fine conducting a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> study with an elderly lady who is partially blind. His father, haying more studies than he could handle, turned this study over to his son.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> In our enthusiasm for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> campaign let us not overlook the seed sown in ths </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">campaign just ended. Keep calling back on all who have shown interest, especially on all subscribers. Endeavor to start a study in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font8"> booklet, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> or the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font8"> book. And what about those who subscribed a year ago and who let their subscription expire? Call on each one of these, showing them their need to feed at Jehovah’s table. Where you are unable to obtain a renewal, turn to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font8">book and try to place it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Let us also remember those whom we helped to get started in the witness work in recent months. Remember, maturity takes time. As Jesus showed, it is “first the grassblade, then the stalk-head, and finally the full grain in the head.” (Mark 4: 28) Or to use another illustration, spiritual children do not become full grown overnight. We must be imitators of the apostle Paul in that we continue to give fatherly exhortation and show motherly, gentle and loving perseverance.—1 Thess. 2: 7-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> We also have the privilege on Decoration Day of comforting those that mourn, concerning which </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> has more to say on page four. In all such ways we can, during the month of May, show our appreciation for our spiritual paradise and help to expand and fill it with integrity keepers, praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theme: Extending and Peopling Our Spiritual Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font7">Talk on “Extending and Peopling Our Spiritual Paradise/’ (See “Watchtower,” 2/1/59, p. 77, and 5/1/59, p. 275.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font7">Questions and answers on the main article “Look! Our Spiritual Paradise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">25 min: Paradise sermon demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Enthusi istic talk by chairman on need for uging effective new sermon with “Paradise” book, now to be placed for first time with public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(15 min.) Congregation develops sermon under chairman’s direction. Have sermon outline on platform for all to see and follow. First invite the congregation to give introductions that may be used in addition to the one suggested below. Then consider the one below and call on audience to develop points of the outline. Special attention should be given transitions from introduction to the body, and from the body ,:.he c-.-'nc;. .su/.y and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">titQ</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher might introduce the sermon by saying: “Good morning. I am a minister making house calls. My purpose is to cultivate a better understanding of the Bible and of God’s purpose for mankind. For example, perhaps you have wondered what God’s purpose was in creating man and placing him on earth. Was it just to suffer and have trouble, as is often the case today?” (Let them answer if they will.) Your next words may be governed by their reply, but you may continue by saying: “When God cheated man and woman and placed them in the paradise garden of Eden he made it clear that the earth was to be their home and that they were to take care of it. This is shown by the record at Genesis 2:15 . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Man to care for paradisaic garden of Eden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Gen. 2: 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Disobedience caused them to lose paradise and suffer death</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">—•Gen. 3: 22-24</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus' death opened way for regaining paradise; told evildoer: “You will be with me in paradise.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Luke 23: 43</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">(paraphrase)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Conditions to prevail when paradise regained —Rev. 21:3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In conclusion one might say: “God purposed for the earth to be a paradise, as shown in the Bible book of Genesis and as illustrated here on page 16 of this book.” (Open “Paradise” book, show them illustration and read first four lines of paragraph 31. Then say:) “This paradise was lost due to the rebellion of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. It will be restored, as we read at Revelation 21: 3, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font7"> and as illustrated here on page 241. [Show them.] Wouldn’t you like to live under such paradise conditions? Note what it says here in paragraph 25. [Read it.] I know you will want to read this Bible aid book, ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained’ [Show cover], so you may understand more about how God soon will restore paradise conditions. This copy is yours for only 75c.” if book is not taken, offer two latent magazines for 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Call on publisher, prepared in advance, to give sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Cha pman encourages all to support campaign fully, placing new book by using '.his sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on statement based on Col. 1: 10 at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welccme, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: “Con;-nue to Aid New Publishers”—quesvons and answers as well as suggestions from audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Demonstration based on material in “Pres mting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">18 min: Reading of May pioneer letter and talk on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font7"> min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on statement based on Phil. 1:9 at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Talk on “New World News.” Some local news may be included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">22 min: Ministry school demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(6 min.) School servant talks on importance of school as provision for training for all Jehovah’s people in teaching as well as public speaking. It builds up knowledge of Bible doctrines and understanding of principles. School servant interested in progressive development of each speaker. Helps them make progress step by step by counseling on major weaknesses each time until speakers improve and overcome these weaknesses. As questions arise on preparing talks he is happy to answer them. In March, demonstration was most helpful to sisters and others giving third and fourth talks. Other speakers have questions that ;t seems well to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(12 min.) B-other who has just received assignment to give first instruction talk is called to platform so he may repeat, fcr benefit of all, question he has asked school servant. He asks how to bring '&gt;ut points and cover all material in just fifteen minutes. Servant suggests better condensing, picking out one or two major points in each paragraph, making them stand out in minds of listeners, rather than covering a multitude of points. Make the material your own; do not just read expressions or sentences from the book. (Give illustration of preparation from current instruction talk.) Timing important; should be limited to fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another bro'.her comes to platform and wants to know proper manner of delivering firs' student talk. Servant, mentioning points from Ministry School Instructions, shows need is for simplicity, making talk conversational as if talking to newcomer or at a back-call or Bible study. It is not so much a discourse as it is an informal extemporaneous discussion of the material as if with a perron of good will. Make talk logical, understandable and conversational, bridging the gap between* scriptures witn clear exposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to Bible reading assignment, another brother asks, May we include analytical and interpretative material? Servant recommends including such material, especially in conclusion, as it emphasizes important scriptures with their meaning and application today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Key to best public speaking and reading found in preparation and application of previous counsel received. Last-minute or insufficient preparation will not do justice to material or allow for real teaching. Bible readers especially should practice reading aloud many times so they will convey proper understanding, reading with feeling, sense stress, clear enunciation and proper modulation. (Other weaknesses in local school may be discussed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(4 min.) Servant emphasizes need of properly preparing school assignments and of making practical use of training and knowledge gained from school in field ministry. We are “a theatrical spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men,” so we must conduct ourselves as well-trained ministers, “handling the word of the truth aright.” Our application of counsel given will assure improved presentation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk on “The Importance of Attending Assemblies.” Arouse enthusiasm for Awake Ministers District Assemblies. Local arrangements to attend may also be included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Talk by mature brother on “Congregation Organization” article “Confidential Matters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of article “Comfort the Mourning Ones.” Also demonstrate offer at cemetery. (Note: Congregations having a fifth meeting this month should have this feature on the fifth week’s program. Substitute for this week a 20-minute part featuring magazine service.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Concluding comments and experiences of publishers in placing “Paradise” book and starting studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Congregations having a fifth meeting will prepare their own program. Remember to include coverage and demonstration of article “Comfort the Mourning Ones.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Confidential Matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> We are living in serious times when men betray one another and the love of the greater number has grown cold. Those of the New World society must keep their unity and the bond of love by their strong adherence to Jehovah’s principles of righteousness. In this connection, keeping a confidence is very important. Certain things are not to be made public knowledge and talked about, to the hurt of our brothers. Reports similar to those made to the apostle have come to the Society: “We hear certain ones are walking disorderly among you, not working at all but meddling with -what does not concern them.”—2 Thess. 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> From time to time servants and other mature brothers in the congregation are called upon to consider confidential matters. If they were disclosed to persons other than those concerned and directly responsible to act upon them, it would do much harm. When matters are discussed by the committee or a personal matter is disclosed to a mature brother in seeking advice, the question before each servant is: How is the revealed matter to be handled theocratically and with proper confidence? The imperfect personality being as it is and the tongue being prone to talk glibly, each one, and especially the overseer and his assistants, must keep a tight bridle on the tongue. “The one walking about as a slanderer is uncovering confidential talk, but the one faithful in spirit is covering over a matter.” —Prov. 11:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A NEW FILM!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It is with great pleasure that the Society announces the release of the new film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Starting May 2, 1959, it will be shown at all circuit assemblies on Saturday evening, followed by a special forty-minute program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> To make possible the showing of the new film on Saturday night, the circuit activity meeting, featuring the fine program on the art of teaching at home Bible studies, and which has been so much appreciated by the brothers, will replace the service meeting and ministry school on Friday night.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Plan now to attend all three days of your coming circuit assembly, and do all you can to encourage newer publishers and persons of good will to attend with you.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Continue to Aid New Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Often new publishers must be helped along for years before they come to real maturity. What can be done to aid them to be diligent about taking in knowledge? The congregation overseer should pay frequent friendly visits on new ones and not wait jintil they become inactive before doing so. His discussions should always be spiritually uplifting so that new publishers will want to read the publications and associate with Jehovah’s people. Talk about the enriching truths found in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Atoake!</span><span class="font8"> Speak enthusiastically about </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> the field ministry and congregation meetings. Make them realize that it is a joy to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Show them how they can carry out Peter’s counsel at 2 Peter 1: 5-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> What else can we do to aid new publishers to press forward toward greater personal maturity? We can and should continue studying with them until they become fully qualified to teach from house to house, make back-calls, hold Bible studies and answer Bible questions. We should create a warm bond of Christian friendship with them by helping them with new sermons and rehearsing them together. Instead of always preparing for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study by ourselves, we can make arrangements to go over the lessons with our new publishers. A family in the truth can invite a new family of publishers over for this purpose. There is no need to make this a social function; keep in mind the reason for your getting together. The association and spiritual enjoyment alone should make the occasion worth while. In Brooklyn a young couple with five children go to a new publisher’s home one week and the next week the new publisher brings her two children over to this more mature family to prepare their </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> lesson. The results have been rewarding. The new publisher not only attends the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">study and comments, but goes regularly in service. And her husband who was opposed has, by this pleasant association, demonstrated a meeker attitude and more interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> We cannot be lax for one minute with those who have come into the organization and have associated themselves with us. We must help them to study and attend meetings so that they will grow to full maturity. The real help will come to them from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> because here is the true spiritual food that will build them up.

<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> There are times when things must be revealed to keep Jehovah’s organization clean and above reproach, but a report of this nature should be made to the congregation servant or servants responsible to correct a situation and should never be gossiped about. Like the unoccupied young widows the apostle Paul speaks about, some are guilty of being “gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs, talking of things they ought not.” (1 Tim. 5: 13) The Society is receiving reports that some brothers are lax in this respect and some sisters become too concerned about the confidential affairs of the congregation, some even using devious means to obtain information from their husbands who are servants. The relationship of husband and wife does not require the theocratic husband to reveal the confidential affairs of the congregation or of brothers within the organization to his wife. These are things that are revealed to him because of his position in the organization and that he otherwise would not be entitled to know, and they must remain confidential, unless information is made public according to proper procedure. The wife, having deep respect for her husband, should respect this confidence. “Plead your own cause with your fellow man and do not reveal the confidential talk of another, that the one listening may not put you to shame and the bad report by you can have no recall.”—Prov. 25 : 9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the Book “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>x</sup>As ministers, we should have a logical, smooth, helpful transition from the sermon to the book that will hold the householder’s interest and enable him to see that the book will fill the desire for further knowledge that is awakened by the sermon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> After commenting briefly on Revelation 21: 4 one may say: “This is not a dream. It is just being practical. God purposed from the very first to restore what Adam lost. But we must understand that he has a timetable for doing it. This book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise. Regained,</span><span class="font8"> gives point by point the progressive steps in his timetable, right up to the accomplishment of a paradise on earth for mankind. That we may have confidence paradise will be restored, note what is said here on page 219, paragraph 32. [Read.] This copy of the book is yours for a contribution of only 75c.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Or you may say: “This book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,</span><span class="font8"> enables anyone, whether</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Comfort the Mourning Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It was wisely written: “Better is it to go to the house of mourning than to go to the banquet house.” (Eccl. 7:2) The mourner is in a better frame of mind for listening to God’s Word than the merrymaker. On Decoration Day, May 30, mourners will be visiting cemeteries all over the country. This will be a splendid opportunity for us to fulfill our commission to “comfort all the mourning ones” by speaking with these people about God’s purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> You will get hearing ears if you use a kind and tactful approach. Instead of bluntly offering the magazines, talk with the person first in a friendly manner. Comment about the flowers on the grave. Inquire if the one he is mourning was a relative. Show a friendly, sympathetic interest in the person, letting him express himself. Introduce yourself as a local minister. Explain that you are briefly speaking with the people to give them a few words of comfort. In some cases you may religious or not yro get a clear understanding of what the Bible really tells us about God’s purpose to restore paradise without going into controversy over religious doctrines. Notice what it says in the last paragraph on page 7 . . .”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Attention can be called to one of several features of the book that will appeal to householders: The large type for easy reading; the clear, simple everyday language without complicated religious words; the many excellent illustrations and the way it briefly tells the high lights of the Bible story in the order in which they happened, so that a person can get the time order of these events straightened out in his mind. It makes the Bible easy to understand. The book can be described as a most practical aid for family Bible discussion and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JUNE “From Paradise Lost to Paradise ' Regained” and one booklet for 75c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">' Paying Attention to the Flock</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">।</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God.—Acts 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">want to read from the Bible Acts 24: 15 or John 5: 28, 29 before offering the magazines. Other times, after using the approach outlined above, you may turn right to the comforting articles in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> of June 1 and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> of May 22. Go about your comforting work inconspicuously, avoiding crowds.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Excellent results were had by the brothers who did this work last year. Some of their experiences were printed in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> of October 15, 1958. It would be good to read these again for the encouragement they give. You will note that the first one shows the effectiveness of being friendly and willing to listen to the people. Carry a supply of the tract </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rope for the Dead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> It may be advisable to assign portions of a cemetery to the various service centers to ensure a systematic coverage. It will be appreciated if congregation servants will report to the Society especially good experiences and results.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> What a remarkable day to be alive, when Jehovah has provided visible signs and wonders for all to see!—Jer. 32: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Are you engaged in magnifying Jehovah’s name by explaining his sighs and wonders? What better way could there be to do so than by offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> subscription to everyone we meet. If you still have Resolution calls to make, start with these. Publishers throughout the country report excellent results from these calls, often placing subscriptions and starting studies at two or three homes in as many hours. Be sure to follow through on everyone on your list. After you have made your Resolution calls, then present the subscription offer from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Are you individually meeting your subscription quota? There are numerous possibilities and we want to follow through on them all. For example, have you offered the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> subscription at each home where you conduct a study? Be sure they have opportunity to receive its benefits. When a householder says he may take the subscription later, do you make out the subscription slip right then and make a date to call back to make final arrangements? Try it. Are you calling on all not-at-homes? When someone shows interest but says he does not have the money for a subscription, offer it for six months. Use the foreign-language editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> It is now available in fifty-three languages. If you have varied nationalities in your territory, carry samples of the magazine in their language and show them. Sometimes they want them not only for themselves but for relatives as well. When congregation servants receive expiration slips from the Society, they should make sure that these calls are cared for right away. Renew interest by giving a sermon, then offer the subscription. Special activity should also be arranged for those who have a few days off for Easter. Make this your best </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> campaign yet.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Our ministry is not simply to obtain subscriptions, but to help others to become praisers of Jehovah. Keep this in mind as you call from house to house. If the interest is there and the householder is willing to spend the time, start a study on that first call. Do it whenever possible. In the case of others, arrange to call back soon. As you present the back-call sermon be alert to opportunities to bridge over to the literature. It may require only a scripture or two of introduction before they are. ready. At other times it may be necessary to give the entire sermon before introducing the study. Be alert to adapt your pres-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Working for an Increase</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> To reach our hoped-for goal of a 20-percent increase in April, careful planning and diligent work will be required. In addition to those who have already shared in the service, there is another marvelous potential of praisers of Jehovah—the 191,642 individuals and families with whom home Bible studies were conducted during January.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> First, each congregation book study conductor should study the situation in his own service center and plan now a program to help all publishers to be in the service during March and early in April. See that those needing assistance are receiving training in giving sermons, which is our goal during March. Also, beginning right now let’s help our persons of good will to think about service. At each study, new or old, it is suggested that we follow this program during the month of March: After your study the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">first week,</span><span class="font14"> read them the experiences found in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font14"> on page 86, 1f3, and page 265, p, or some, other one that talks about people starting out in the service. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">second week </span><span class="font14">tell them about the growth of the New World society and particularly how new ones are trained when they start out in service. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">third week </span><span class="font14">discuss the importance of the Memorial, using the article in the March 15 issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> and make definite arrangements for them to attend. As the entire arrangement takes shape in their mind those who are really sheeplike will want to have a share in Jehovah’s service. Invite them to go with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Monday, March 23, after 6 p.m., is the time for the Memorial. Special arrangements should be made to see that everyone associated with the New World society and all good-will persons are assisted to be present. Both servants and publishers should plan ahead to see that none are overlooked. At the meeting go out of your way to be friendly, introduce new ones to others present and make them feel at home. In his concluding comments, after the Memorial talk and the serving of the emblems, the congregation servant or the Memorial speaker will invite all to attend the public talk on April 5 and briefly discuss the privilege of sharing in the field service, encouraging both publishers and good-will persons to have a share in the special activity that weekend. Help all men to see Jehovah’s signs and wonders in this time of the end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theme: Explaining- God’s Signs and Wonders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Talk on ‘’Explaining God’s Signs and Wonders.” (See “Watchtower,” 11/15/58, p. 685, and 3/1/59, p. 150.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article “Explaining God’s Signs and Wonders.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Talk on “Increasing Home Bible Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Reading of the pioneer letter together with an enthusiastic talk based on the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">25 min: Demonstration on “Aiding New Ones to Attend Memorial and Share in Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Paragraph six of main article outlines the procedure for aiding new ones to attend Memorial and share in service. Try this three-point method at your home Bible study even though you may have conducted it for only a few weeks. Let us see how easy it is to follow this program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE I (5 min.) After the study the first week of this program, prepared publisher, Brother Helper, reads the “Yearbook” experiences and makes appropriate comments on them. Publisher invites good-will person, Mr. Ready, to attend public talk. Ready asks for a few extra handbills to give to friends. Helper asks Ready to look up Acts 20: 20, think about it and prepare a comment on it for the next study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) The next step depends upon the response of the good-will person. If publisher discerns good-will person is ready for service, he may, during this first week, invite good-will person to go in service. If not ready, publisher keeps building up the idea of Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE II (5 min.) After the study the second week, Helper asks Ready to read Acts 20: 20 and then asks what his comment on it is. Ready comments on it correctly. Helper commends him. Helper then describes the growth of the New World Society as a preaching organization world-wide, using some “Yearbook” figures. Helper shows that early Christians were assisted to preach; ties in 1 Corinthians 11: 1. Helper now explains how new ones are helped today, that they are not started out on their own, etc. Helper invites Ready to go along in Kingdom service, such as house-to-house magazine work. A definite day and time is set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Some good-will persons may not be ready after the second week. Even if Mr. Ready was not ready and Helper did not think it appropriate yet to invite him into service, progress is being made and there is more that should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE III (5 min.) At close of study the third week, Helper discusses: (1) Blessing of being a Christian, hope of everlasting life. (2) Jesus’ great sacrifice for our benefit. (3) March 23: Memorial: what it includes (1 Cor. 11: 23-26). Emphasize Jesus’ command, using the article in the March 15, 1959, issue of “The Watchtower.” Ready responds to invitation to attend. Definite arrangements are made to help Ready attend Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) An ideal time to extend the invitation to service will be at Memorial. Paragraph seven of main article shows that after the Memorial talk and serving of the emblems either the congregation servant or the Memorial speaker will invite all to the April 5 talk and encourage good-will persons to share in special preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">SCENE IV (3 min.) Memorial is over and congregation servant has just given brief talk on Kingdom service privileges. Helper discusses with Ready the special activity. Helper invites Ready to share in service, reminding him of the help extended new ones. Definite arrangements are-made for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) The program is flexible and can be adapted to needs of good-will persons with whom you study. All can use this method. When they know this is the truth, it is time to begin teaching others. Share fully in Memorial activity and help others start in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">7 min: Talk on article “Prepare Now for April Peaks!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on statement based on Eph. 4: 12 at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: New World News report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Experiences from “Yearbook” on how publishers benefit from the theocratic ministry school. Children who are attentive at the school show the good training it gives them. In Newfoundland a clergyman quizzed a class of public school pupils on the Bible. Out of twenty-five students only two could answer his questions. These two were Jehovah’s witnesses. They had taken full advantage of the ministry school (218). Some publishers do not enroll in the school because they do not feel capable of giving talks. The school can train them if they will let it. If a person who is blind is willing to give talks, is there any reason why those who can see should not give them? In Eritrea a blind beggar came into the truth. He enrolled in the ministry school and gave student talks despite the fact that he could not see to read (83). He was willing to try, that he might benefit from the training the school gives. Are you showing the same willingness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">12 min: School servant’s report—with encouragement for all to attend and benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on statement based on 1 Thess. 5: 11 at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: “Make Sure of All Things,” on New World Living from page 273, “Satan, God of This World,” to 1 Tim. 6: 3-5 on page 274. To be handled by publisher on platform posing as person of good will asking about New World living, which questions can be answered by audience by using texts appearing in assigned portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Theocratic Ministry School Suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(5 min.) School servant talks on value of revised school program. Equal emphasis to be placed on the effective presentation of the Kingdom message in the field service and improving our speaking ability. Counsel to stress more the art of teaching. Brothers and sisters alike will be taught to deliver effective, logical and coherent sermons. Some questions that have arisen on preparing and delivering the last two student talks will be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(13 min.) School servant talks to group of sisters on platform who have questions on their part in the school. As questions are put to the servant he answers each one, quoting references, where possible, in “Qualified to Be Ministers.” They ask such things as how to outline talks properly; how to cover all material and stay within time limit; how extensive notes should be; type of introduction to use; how to overcome nervousness; if talk should be a house-to-house sermon or back-call sermon; how much time literature presentation should take up; how much sister serving as householder should have to say, etc. Servant, in part, replies: notes should be few', perhaps just scriptures and brief thoughts on a slip of paper placed in Bible; introductions should lead into material and have some definite relation to material discussed and common situations in field; nervousness overcome by good preparation, practice with assistant and experience; way material lends itself should govern how it will be handled, whether as house-to-house or back-call sermon; literature presentation at house-to-house call should be very brief (only 15 to 30 seconds) making it obvious that publisher has made a successful transition to the offer without losing the householder’s interest, but publisher may continue with explanation of literature until stopped by school servant at the end of six minutes; speaker definitely should endeavor to draw householder into conversation but assistant’s part should be limited to questions or brief replies to questions asked by publisher, so as to keep sermon progressive. Sisters express appreciation for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(2 min.) Brother in audience raises hand and, when called on, asks if servant can now answer questions he and other brothers have on preparing and delivering talks. Servant, with glance at watch, regrets time will not allow, but arrangements will be made to take up questions of brothers on future service meeting. He will be happy to aid any privately to understand how to prepare talks or overcome speaking weaknesses. Good support from all will bring mutual benefits and blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Talk on “Response to the Call for Pioneers.” Also use local experiences on entering pioneer service and, if necessary, experiences on p. 53 of 1958 Convention Report.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Practice and constructive counsel are the combination that produces better and more qualified Kingdom preachers. The theocratic ministry school provides the student with both. If the full benefit of the school is to be obtained there must be good preparation by the school servant and each student. In order that the school may be improved the Society is arranging for the congregation servant to spend time with the school servant during the month of March. He will give constructive counsel to the school servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Both servants should review early in the month Studies 26 and 62 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font14"> and paragraphs 128-130, 140 and 141 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font14"> and the article on “Congregation Organization’’ in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> of March, 1958. Attention should be centered particularly on giving constructive counsel to the brothers and sisters enrolled, making assignments, the problems of handling more than one school, how to have more enroll, how to improve school attendance and giving personal assistance to students on talks and in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The school servant should take an interest in each student and give counsel to correct weaknesses. Do more than point out the weaknesses. Perhaps private coaching may be necessary. When giving his analysis</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&amp; During January new all-time peaks were reached in both back-calls and home Bible studies. There were 1,451,274 back-calls made, exceeding the previous peak by 390,299, and making an average of 5.2 per publisher. And there were 191,642 home Bible studies conducted, exceeding the previous peak by 2,179.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A Memorial report card has been sent to each congregation with written reviews. The congregation servant will please see that it is filled out and put in the mail promptly after the special public talk on April 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Toward the end of March one copy of the April 15 “Watchtower,” which contains the talk “The Perfect Government for All Mankind,” will be sent to each congregation servant by second-class mail. When it is received please see that it is given to the brother who has been assigned to deliver the April 5 public talk, so he will have ample opportunity to practice it. You should receive yours not later than April 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">of a written review he should not give too much attention to the grades. He can give the average grade, but no good is accomplished by mentioning the lowest and highest grades. The grades are not what is important. No cause should be given for anyone to boast before others or to himself. (Gal. 6:14) What should be emphasized is the number taking the review and how the students can benefit from their error by looking up the answers. When a written review is approaching, study conductors should remind their group of it. They can arouse interest in it by verbally quizzing the publishers on the material to be covered before and after the study, as well as at other appropriate times. Each should encourage his group to have 100-percent participation in the review. The school servant can also arouse interest in the review by quizzing the brothers when going to field service or when in casual conversation with them. He should watch to be sure all points in the review are directly covered during talks. Those not covered should be brought out by him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The school servant should support fully service center activity. He can help train less experienced publishers.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Response to the Call for Pioneers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> There Is nothing we do that means more to us than our service to Jehovah. While other Scriptural obligations may demand much time, dedicated witnesses have their heart in the Kingdom service. Not only does this govern the. way they perform secular work and manage their family affairs, but it moves them to have just as full a share in the field ministry as possible. The Society has done much to encourage all to seize the opportunities that are open, and the response has been good. During December and January alone 469 regular pioneer applications and 2,134 vacation pioneer applications were received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> A brother whose personal obligations make it difficult for him to be a regular pioneer wrote: “Vacation pioneering is something that I can do. Those pioneer letters that the Society is sending once a month are wonderful reminders of our obligations. They make a person think.” And a sister who is a widow with seven dependent children, after hearing the letters encouraging fulltime service, requested that the Society transfer her name from the roll of vacation pioneers to the regular pioneer ranks on February 1. Even winter months could not make her put it off.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Whole congregations are working together to expand the ranks of regular and vacation pioneers, and from one such congregation this letter was received: “We are very happy to enclose IT applications for vacation pioneer service in December. . . . Our former experience with 31 vacation pioneers last November and 48 last April has shown that striving to get as many as possible to pioneer is tremendously stimulating and strengthening to the congregation as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font14"> whole. . . . Our field service has grown in all phases. We have already enjoyed a 23-percent increase in October. . . . We are certainly moved to thank Jehovah for all the blessings we are enjoying. Things are so lively and enthusiastic around our Kingdom Hall we just about have to turn the lights off to get anyone to go home after a meeting.” Why not work together in your congregation to encourage pioneering<sup>-</sup>? Similar blessings can be yours!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Who are the ones entering the pioneer ranks? Some of them are persons who are single and free of obligations.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> During this season you may want to use the sermon on “God’s Kingdom.” (December, 1958, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry)</span><span class="font14"> One may use this type of introduction: “I am calling on my neighbors today in regard to a matter of special concern at this time. At Easter season millions of people give much consideration to an event that happened 1900 years ago—the death and resurrection of Jesus. Several days are set aside for special observance. What does that event back there mean for us? you may ask. Some will answer, Salvation and deliverance. But how? Jesus taught a prayer that answers how and when he will deliver honest people from this world’s troubles.” (Go into sermon.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Or you may say : “Good morning. As a minister, I feel it very important to make a brief call during this religious holiday season because of its significance to all of us. Today we live only a few short years. While we enjoy life, it ends soon and maybe you have wondered, as many others have, Is this all there is to life? Now at this season people give special thought to the death and resurrection of Christ as a hope for future life. But how will it be brought about, and who will enjoy it? The Bible has a very satisfactory answer. In fact, it is found in the familiar words of the Lord’s prayer. Here Jesus himself tells us the answer . . .”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">do this, it is requested that as soon as possible the assistant congregation servant inform each publisher of his previous peak in magazine placements, whether that peak was reached last April or since then. Each publisher, keeping in mind April’s special activity, can individually determine how much over his previous peak he will be able to go. Then place an order with the magazine-territory servant right away to be sure you will have enough of the special issues to reach that goal. Orders should be sent in by March 10. Before the order is sent to the Society the magazine-territory servant will want to check with each publisher to be sure he has had opportunity to place an order for the extra magazines he will need.</span></p>

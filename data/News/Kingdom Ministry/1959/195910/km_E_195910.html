<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Make “Awake!” Campaign Biggest and Best Ever</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Before Armageddon—this is the most urgent time to talk of the glory of Jehovah’s Kingdom rulership. “About the glory of your kingship they will talk.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> plays an important role in helping Jehovah’s witnesses announce the rulership of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">- How does </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A'wake!</span><span class="font9"> help us to live up to this month’s theme? Each issue has, besides “Your Word Is Truth,” a short Scriptural article at the front of the magazine followed by a public talk article. The Kingdom and its rulership are usually mentioned. And think of this: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is a journal that you can offer without hesitance to a person who has only a minimum of interest in religious matters. By reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> those with poor spiritual appetites can readily develop an appetite for spiritual things. Householders learn that the New World society educates people in practical things, that the scope of knowledge covered in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is so broad it is like a college education ! Through </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> householders come in contact with the only group announcing the rulership of God’s kingdom. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> may be the very instrument that will begin opening the door for them to the New World society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Compelling are the reasons, then, for our placing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> in the hands of the people. What good we can do by making the October campaign the biggest and best </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> campaign ever! Our previous best </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> campaign was in 1956. Examine these figures :</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1956 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1957 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1958</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;168,286 149,603 144,746</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1956, with 176,470 publishers, we obtained 168,286 subscriptions. Not as many subscriptions were obtained in 1957 and 1958 even with more publishers. So diligent efforts will be required to make this the biggest and best campaign ever. Individually we should strive to meet our quotas. For congregation publishers it is one subscription, for pioneers five subscriptions, and special pioneers eight. Offer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> at every door. Congregations having a supply of the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making AU Things New”</span><span class="font9"> may use it as part of the three-booklet premium. Publishers will remit 90c for each one-year subscription. If persons already subscribe for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> offer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> If special pioneers and those working in isolated territories prefer to offer subscriptions to both magazines, with six booklets, on a contribution of $2 they may do so.</span></p>

See “I’resenting the Good News” for transitions from the sermon into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> offer. Know your magazine well; adapt your presentation to the individual householder. Show him a specific article in the current issue, also mention other kinds that appear from time to time in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> Show how </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> helps one meet the problems of our day. To a woman you might point out that some issues have articles on rearing children, family and marriage problems, etc. Some publishers may find interest is developed by displaying certain previous issues. The articles in the issues of March 22 and April 22, for example, could be used, or the numerous articles on religion. Explain that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is international. It has correspondents in all parts of the world. Recommend </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> too by your enthusiasm—a powerful recommendation. From your enthusiastic presentation householders will sense that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> is important for them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Here are some aids toward making this the biggest and best </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> campaign: A chart in the Kingdom Hall will tell the congregation how it is doing in meeting its subscription quota. At service centers put special emphasis on meeting quotas individually. Let study conductors encourage and help those who do not obtain a subscription early in the month. Stress getting a good start by being out the first week of the campaign. Strive for at least two hours from house to house with the offer every week. The more times the magazine is offered, the more likely a subscription will be obtained. Turn magazine routes into subscriptions. Call back on promises and not-at-homes. At service centers on Sunday morning let different publishers comment on what they have said to make </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> appeal to householders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Make out subscription slips so they can be easily and correctly read. Too many unreadable slips, even inaccurate ones, come to the Society. Therefore some subscribers do not receive their magazines. Before publishers turn in a slip, let them check it. If there is the slightest possibility of the name or address being misread, make the correction by printing the information. Remember, someone else must read it, not you 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> As announcers of the rulership of God’s kingdom, we must be teachers. To do that well we will want to call back on these sub-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Announcing the Rulership of God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">6 min: “New World News” and announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Talk on the theme for the month, ‘‘Announcing the Rulership of God’s Kingdom,” and the role of “Awake!” in accomplishing it. (See “Watchtower,” October 15, 1958, p. 625, and October 1, 1959, p. 603.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font8">Question-and-answer cover</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">age </span><span class="font8">of the article ‘‘Announce the Rulership of God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Demonstration on ‘‘Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font8">min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on Mark 13: 10, at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER </span><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Questions and answers on “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">30 min: Demonstration on Proper Handling of Subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Much time spent preparing sermons and talking points on magazines, arranging affairs to share in service, going to and working in territory. Yet when we reach our goal we can spoil it by a few moments of neglect. How so? Watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (6 min.) Publisher delivers good brief sermon, obtains “Awake!” subscription. Householder gives name; publisher hastily writes on slip, does not have householder check it for correctness, concludes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Calls publisher over, asks how many subscriptions obtained. Publisher, elated, explains he has finally obtained first. Chairman congratulates, asks to see subscription slip. Puzzled, he asks what the person’s name is. And what is that number in the address? Publisher recognizes that slip is not very legible. Chairman shows that slip is not complete either. No zone number given (in rural areas show no route number given), new or renewal not checked. Publisher counseled: Spent much time to make this subscription possible, but failure to take few moments to fill out slip carefully and accurately may deprive householder of subscription. Publisher does not want that to happen, wants instruction on properly filling out slip. Chairman asks publisher to take seat, fill out slip with entire congregation as they learn how to handle subscriptions properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (12 min.) Audience participation. (Have one subscription slip passed to each publisher before meeting; ask them to fill out correctly as parts are discussed.) Cover thirteen points on “How to Properly Handle Subscriptions,” taking each point, asking audience how they would properly handle that item, and then reading and discussing Society’s instructions on the item. Emphasize following these instructions strictly.. Get information from householder accurately, print carefully in ink or indelible pencil, and have householder check for correctness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Many subscribers do not receive subscriptions or they are greatly delayed because of illegible, inaccurate and incomplete slips made out and turned in by publishers. Hence this instruction sheet sent to congregations. Do not think, “This is good enough,” or, “This will get by.” Slips so easy to make out, only reason for error is neglect. Make sure it is absolutely right. Doublecheck it yourself and have householder check it. Instruction sheet will be posted on bulletin board for you to study. Accounts servant will carefully check all slips and require publishers to complete or remake faulty ones. Householder wants and needs the spiritual food. Do not waste valuable time and let carelessness deprive him of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7 min: Experiences from publishers on “Awake!” subscriptions, especially highlighting how the subscriptions were obtained and favorable comments about the magazine made by goodwill persons. (May use experiences in 1959 “Yearbook,” pp. 207, 209, if there is time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">8 min: Concluding comments. (Include remarks on the slogan based on 1 Timothy 4: 16, at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font8">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font8">Back-call on new “Awake!” subscriber. Demonstration, using material in “Make Sure of All Things,” page 279, from heading “Mind Must Be Continually Filled with Right Matters” through Hebrews 10: 25, to answer questions raised by person of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Report from assistant congregation servant on visit with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 min: Know Your Magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(Advise publishers in advance to bring October 15 “Watchtower” and October 22 “Awake!” and to be prepared to participate.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Talk about the good results that come from magazine distribution and having people regularly receiving magazines through mail. Compare congregation magazine placements with rest of country. Encourage all to make October a record magazine month. Goal for publishers is one new subscription, pioneers 5, and special pioneers 8. For best results, know the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(6 min.) Divide audience into two groups. Propound a question to first group regarding a point in October 22 “Awake!” If answer is not given promptly, turn to the other group and let them answer. Then give the second group the first chance to answer the next question. Frame questions so they will bring out talking points that can be used in presenting “Awake!” either on Magazine Day or with the subscription offer. It is best to make up questions from three or four articles. Then publishers who have prepared in advance should be called on to give several 30- to 60-second presentations that demonstrate how the points discussed can be effectively used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(6 min.) Propound questions to the audience on articles in the October 15 “Watchtower,” in the same manner as was done with “Awake!” The chairman might include among his questions one that asks for the points in the magazine that would appeal to a busy housewife or a workingman, or he might ask how certain local objections often encountered on Magazine Day may be overcome. Have two publishers demonstrate brief Magazine Day presentations using these points. While one magazine is featured, both “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” should be offered together for 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(4 min.) Have two model demonstrations showing how to present the “Awake!” subscription offer on conclusion of the current sermon. Keep in mind the fine suggestions contained in “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(5 min.) Interview local publishers who have done well in obtaining “Awake!” subscriptions during the campaign. Ask them in what feature of service they obtained the subscriptions, what they pointed out in the magazine, what they said that roused interest, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(2 min.) Chairman reviews some of the practical suggestions given during the demonstration and encourages the publishers to use them in the field. He reminds them to fill out all subscription slips carefully, and to make return calls on all subscription promises as well as on expiration notices. Make the current “Awake!” campaign the biggest and best ever by wholehearted activity on the part of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments, including points in the article “1959—a Full Year of Spiritual Growth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk: “Using ‘Awake!’ to Good Advantage in Our Territory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">17 mih: Talk and questions and answers on the article “Be a Teacher from House to House.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Demonstration arranged by school servant showing how to apply principles of teaching in house-to-house ministry. Include suggestions on how to overcome objections met in territory and how to create in householder desire for “Awake!” subscription. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(Arrange locally, using the last report left by the circuit servant as a guide.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Announce the Kingdom </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font9">scribers. Teach them by starting a study in one of the booklets. Start it right on your initial visit or when you call back to make certain their magazines are coming through the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Let not just the servants and study conductors but all publishers be out each week during the campaign. Let us. exert ourselves as announcers of Jehovah’s rulership, knowing the satisfaction of having met the quota congregationally and individually.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Be a Teacher from House to House</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">,* As Jehovah’s witnesses we have been commissioned to be both preachers and teachers, performing this ministry from house to house. We must preach the good news of the Kingdom to all persons, whether they hear or whether they forbear, in order to find those who respond to the voice of the Right Shepherd and are willing to be taught.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In January, 1953, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font9">urged every publisher to become a house-to-house preacher. By August of that year 73 percent of the publishers had met that standard; now it has gone up to 87 percent—a wonderful increase I This includes all who talk to the public about the good news of the Kingdom, whether in magazine distribution, giving door-to-door sermons, or making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies. Each one should strive to share regularly in each feature of the house-to-house ministry, and, more than that, to be an effective teacher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When calling at the doors, you must first win the interest of the people. As a matter of habit they may try to put you off by saying they are busy. Perhaps you could respond by saying: “Then I’ll be brief. What I wanted to tell you was this . . And then </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">briefly </span><span class="font9">present one interest-rousing point from your sermon. If they are still listening, read the scripture from your sermon that supports what you have said. Now try to draw them into the conversation. That may be as far as you can go with some, but you are fulfilling your mission as a preacher. However, if you have won their interest and they want to hear more, you have the opportunity to teach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In teaching it is important to build on things your hearer already knows, and to explain the truth in terms he can grasp. This means that you should encourage him to express himself. Use questions that call for him to reason on the information you have presented, to see if he gets the sense of it. Clarify ideas that are new to him with illustrations from his everyday experiences. Watch his reactions and be guided by them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Effective teachers prepare and constantly analyze their teaching, seeking ways to improve. They express points simply and use repetition to impress them. They are enthusiastic, speak clearly and with sufficient volume, use sense stress and pausing to good effect, and have proper poise. In teaching they show love, patience, sincerity and tact.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Talks at Service Centers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The congregations are finding more and more ways to expand the public meeting campaign, and one of the best ways is to have public lectures regularly at the service centers. Think of it! Since 1948 the total public lectures have increased in the United States from 45,44(5 to the amazing figure of 176,632, or an average of close to one each week for the nearly 4,000 congregations. Having public lectures frequently at the service centers has done much to increase the number and effectiveness of the public lectures. Are they regularly held at your service centers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The Society has suggested that the regular public talks be scheduled, and, for variety, subjects based on chapters of “iet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font9"> may be chosen. Several related chapters might be combined under one subject if advisable. The public speakers can be given assignments and then they can rotate in giving their talks at the respective service centers. Most congregations will find it convenient to have a talk at each service center each month, at least one every two months. The congregation servant should make up a schedule and post this for the information of all, having in mind that it is not advisable for study conductors to be away from their groups more than once a month to give talks. The congregation will count each of these meetings as a public lecture on the report to the Society and the speakers may count</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Early in October the congregation servant will meet with the assistant congregation servant to discuss how better to apply the Society’s counsel in the congregation. During the month the congregation servant should arrange to work with him in each feature of the service, giving particular attention to his teaching ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Worldly “Thanksgiving Day,” November 26, will be a special magazine day. Congregations should order their extra magazines by October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">O All congregations are encouraged to follow the suggestion in the October 8, 1959, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> page 26, relative to writing letters to Jordanian officials. Use business letterheads where possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Our desire is to help sheeplike ones to learn the Bible truth. If it is possible to do so, as house-to-house teachers we will start a home Bible study right there on the first call. Indeed, teaching is an art— one that we all should cultivate I</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">the time spent delivering them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> A smaller audience makes it possible for the speaker to be more conversational. If the group is very small, he may find it better to sit down and talk to the group less formally; however, all should be able to hear and see the speaker. The study conductor or another mature brother (or the speaker himself, if necessary) who has previously prepared to serve as chairman should briefly introduce the speaker and the subject. Following the talk a 15-minute model study in the publication currently being considered by the group will be conducted. This will serve to introduce the newly interested ones to our method of study. General questions may be answered after the meeting is dismissed. While the meeting will not be opened with prayer, the first part being a public meeting, it will be closed with prayer, following the brief study and announcements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> These talks provide a fine opportunity to get new ones acquainted with the nearby study. A personal invitation, accompanied by an offer to stop by and take them to the meeting, will do much to create a responsive spirit. Many persons who seem reluctant at first to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall are glad to come to a neighbor’s home to hear a Bible talk. Handbills are not necessary, but publishers should invite all interested persons in the neighborhood. Give full support to these home lectures by being present yourself and by bringing others.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Growth is not something that depends upon us as individuals. I’aul stated : “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” So, then, growth belongs to God. He is responsible for the vast spiritual growth in the New World society during the 19-59 service year, and to him all credit and praise must go.—1 Cor. 3: 6, 7.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> It is a happy experience to glance back over the year and measure the extent of our blessings. We started with 209,910 publishers in the field. Soon this number increased to 223,600, when, in December, we realized a 10.6-percent increase.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> No halting here, however. January began our twenty-first annual </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign, which reaped 439,108 new subscriptions. Special effort was made to bring new ones to meetings and train them to preach, with the result that 354,983 attended the Memorial celebration (an increase of 29,877 over the previous year’s attendance) and April saw 18,347 new ministers Mission of This Journal,” p. 2, par. 3; then offer the subscription.)</span></p></li></ul>

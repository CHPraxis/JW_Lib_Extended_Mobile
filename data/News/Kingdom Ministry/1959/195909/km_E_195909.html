<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>E A TEACHER</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The responsibility rests upon each one of Jehovah’s witnesses to be a teacher. Jesus, who set the example for us, was known to his disciples as their teacher. The apostles followed in his footsteps, and for our benefit one of them wrote: “A slave of the Lord . . . needs to be tactful toward all, qualified to teach.” (2 Tim. 2: 24) It is required of Christian overseers that they be “qualified to teach,” and in this they are “examples to the flock.” To Christians who were slow about advancing to this point, Paul firmly said: “You ought to be teachers in view of the time.”—Heb. : 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During the 1960 service year, now beginning, our goal in the ministry is to follow that sound Scriptural counsel: De a teacher. Not only do we want to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">talk</span><span class="font11"> to others when we go from door to door; we want to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">teach</span><span class="font11"> them. On back-calls and at home Bible studies we should become qualified teachers. We are going to give attention to how to train new ones in the service, how to teach them to study and comment in the meetings; and parents will be encouraged to improve their ability as teachers of their own children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The fact that millions of pieces of Bible literature are placed each year demonstrates the great need for teachers. It is our Christian obligation to go back and feed those who manifest sheeplike qualities, to teach them the divine will. Further, qualified teachers are needed to assist the more than 60,000 new ones who start out in the ministry each year. They must be helped to acquire accurate knowledge and proficiency in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What is “teaching”? It means to impart information in such a way that those hearing get the sense of it. An effective teacher takes into consideration the state of mind of his hearer, whether a householder, a large audience or a member of his own family. Learn to explain truths in terms of the everyday life of the ones you are talking to, as Jesus did. To be effective you must have a heartfelt interest in the ones you teach. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Webster</span><span class="font11"> shows that one who teaches will “make to know how; show how; . . . train, or accustom to some action.” This means that the teacher helps the new one to understand what is to be done with the truths learned. More than that, he </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">shows</span><span class="font11"> him how to do it, actually doing it with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> How does one become “qualified to teach”? Jehovah says: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you.” (Isa. 48:17) We need his spirit and the instruction he gives</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Harmonizing Our Work with Our Ministerial Garments</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our work harmonizes with the beautiful ministerial garments that Jehovah has given us as long as we &quot;are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul fighting side by side for the faith of the good news.” —Phil. 1: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> .September opens another service year of joyfully fighting side by side.for the faith of the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR SEPTEMBER “Your Will Be Done on Earth” and one booklet for 5Oc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR SEPTEMBER ' Harmonizing Our Work with Our . Ministerial Garments.—Phil. 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is the month both to plan our work in the ministry for the year and to get an enthusiastic start. The head of each theocratic family should arrange a time for the family to discuss together how they can improve their ministry and what each member feels he can do weekly in theocratic study and service. Publishers who do not live in theocratic families can discuss their plans with fellow publishers. Inns through his organization. To teach, one must be intimately acquainted with his textbook, the Bible. That requires study—study with a view to teaching others. In addition to personal study, we should be present arid participate in all congregation meetings. We should regularly avail ourselves of assistance given us in the field ministry, both learning how to witness effectively and observing how the instruction is given, so we, in turn, will be “adequately qualified to teach others.” With the help of Jehovah and his organization we can be teachers.—2 Tim. 2 : 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">elude regular study and some share in each feature of the service each week. Arrange a schedule that you can meet every week. “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart.”—2 Cor. 9: 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Servants, too, should carefully consider their responsibilities to see that they are fulfilling them to the best of their ability. It was suggested at the district assemblies that servants should visit all publishers from time to time. Make this a part of your monthly schedule. The Bible study servant will want to check up on studies that have not been held for a while and encourage the publishers to revive studies and back-calls that were disrupted during the summer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Early in September the assistant congregation servant should compute the new congregational quotas and post them on the chart. The congregation should be advised of the new 10-percent quota that the publishers will want to strive to reach by December.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN SEPTEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Talk based on “Make </span><span class="font0">Sure </span><span class="font10">of AU Things,” on New-World Living, from page 277, “One’s Own Conscience, Trained in God’s Word,” through 2 Tim. 2: 18, 19 on page 278.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Analyzing Our Teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">: Each publisher at the meeting-should be given his Publisher’s Record card to allow for individual analysis and comparison with national and congregational averages. Should have paper to copy any figures desired for his own personal information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Assistant congregation servant talks on progress congregation has made during the past year in field activity, improved teaching and growth to maturity. Comments briefly on advancement made through training program. Encourages even greater increase in improved teaching in new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(12 min.) Assistant congregation servant points out that the national averages for the first ten months of the service year were 10.5 hourSj 3.8 back-calls, .7 studies and 12.1 magazines. Publishers averaged a total of 5.1 books during same period. Referring to congregation chart, he gives comparative local congregation figures and invites publishers to see how their own record compares as he discusses figures in various columns. Placement of literature (figures here from congregation Weekly Record Sheet) reflects teaching in house-to-house work. If literature placements are low (books, booklets and magazines), need is likely for improved sermons. Are essential qualities of sermons being used? Servant refers to hour column. Perhaps low placements reflect low activity? Greater activity means more opportunities for placing literature. Do you meet at various service contacts? Are you conscious of need to place magazines at times when regular offer not taken or people are busy? Do you take advantage of opportunities to witness other than regular organized preaching? Wi.se use of all time essential for getting message of Kingdom preached. Your teaching may reflect lack of spiritual nourishment. Do you regularly attend all congregation meetings? Study essential. These are factors closely related to our improved teaching and maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(10 min.) Bible study servant discusses back-call and study figures with audience. In referring to back-call column, servant asks, “How does your follow-up activity compare?” If few back-calls, does this mean you did not use third hour on Sunday for going on. back-calls, or perhaps are not supporting back-call night? Can you recall any placements of literature where you should have called back and have not? How effective are your back-calls? Servant shows this reflects in Bible study column. Nation has improved nicely. What are you doing in Bible study service? If you have been conducting a study for a time, have you helped good-will persons attend meetings or start in field service? Servant encourages all to be particularly mindful of directing the interest to the organization. Be a loving teacher, caring well for persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: Comments by congregation servant. Servant reveals 10-percent and 20-percent goals for congregation for year.

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Experiences from 1959 “Yearbook” on using “This Good News of the Kingdom” to start Bible studies. Present as a demonstration, with two publishers who are enthusiastic about Bible study work discussing the value of the “Good News” booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A woman in Australia was helped spiritually and physically by a study in the booklet. (89-90) A good church member in British Guiana became a Witness because of a ’Study in “This Good News of the Kingdom.” (107) A few studies in the booklet were enough to cause a woman in Denmark to rebuke her clergyman. (140) It was used effectively in Sarawak to bring the truth to the grandchildren of a headhunter. (249) There are many such experiences that testify to how useful this booklet is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Conclude by suggesting that every publisher try starting a study in it this month.</span></p>

A panel of three or four publishers or study conductors seated on platform will also provide answers. Panelists should have special preparation, thoroughly studying the articles on which questions will be asked. Thus even the more difficult questions will have pointed comment. Questions should first go to the audience. From the answers he receives the chairman will determine whether or not to turn the question over to the panel for answer or elaboration. The program should not lag, with too much time spent on individual answers or one article, as there are many fine points to review. Chairman will select questions that have practical value.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> For the past two years provision has been made for the overseer to devote time during a designated month with each of the servants and conductors. This has proved very beneficial, and beginning in October the same schedule will be followed during the 1960 service year. In September the overseer should give thought to his visits and plan these so they will be most profitable to his assistants. He will meet with the assistant congregation servant in October, the Bible Study servant in November, and so on until all the servants and conductors have been visited.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In recent months district servants have been showing the new film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses” at circuit assemblies throughout the world. Everywhere </span><span class="font11">The points outlined in the Congregation Organization articles for the past two years should provide the basis for the discussions. The overseer should have a schedule of things to take up and the servant or conductor can discuss with the overseer any matters that he feels should be taken up to improve the congregation organization. The discussions should be practical. Emphasis should be not only on what can be done to improve but how it can be done in order to get proper results. Definite appointments should be made for the. overseer to work with each one in the field service several times during the month to check his teaching ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The overseer and his assistants must be well organized and must understand their duties thoroughly in.the light of the Scriptures and instructions from the Society in order' to take the lead in the preaching work and thus shepherd the flock;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In 1960 stress will be on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">teaching</span><span class="font11"> in the ministry. As the overseer meets with and works with the servants and conductors, particular attention should be given to their teaching ability and how this can be improved. Continue to use this helpful provision to the full in caring well for the flock now and in preparing for future expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">it has been received with enthusiastic appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In order that many more people of good will may see this documentary film showing the greatest gathering of true Christians ever held on earth, the Society is pleased to announce that extra copies are now available. Branches, circuits, congregations or individuals desiring a set of this film may place their orders as for cash items. The cost is $200.

<p><span class="font10">Warning: Brothers in different parts of the country have suffered a loss of money by persons’ passing bad checks. They have passed the bad checks that were returned unpaid by certain Utah banks. The banks stated that no such account existed or they were unable to locate such account. The checks were passed by a person using the names J. A. Johnson or James A. Johonson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This warning is given for brothers to be cautious in dealing with strange persons posing as Jehovah’s witnesses and seeking to take advantage of them. The person or persons responsible for this fraudulent conduct may use some name other than the two stated above. ♦ Please note the following correction in the Theocratic Ministry School schedule: The reading assignment for the week of October 4 should be Job 38: 33 to 40: 24.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Regularly Attend Meetings</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Why do we go to meetings? First of all because Jehovah God expressly commands us not to forsake the gathering of ourselves. Secondly, because at meetings we become equipped to preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom. Thirdly, because at our meetings we receive education for everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Additionally, we go to meetings because of our love for our brothers. We appreciate the mutual “interchange of encouragement” that takes place at our meetings as by our public declarations we incite one another to love and right works. Also, the servants in the congregation work hard to make the meetings interesting and instructive. By attending we show appreciation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The congregation records show that just as we have a problem as to regularity in publishing we have one in regard to regularity in meeting attendance: 75.9 percent attend the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, 64.6 percent the service meeting, 64.2 percent the ministry school, and 72.6 percent the congregation book study. Those who are not attending regularly need encouragement to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Why are some irregular meeting attenders? Most likely they never formed the good habit of regular meeting attendance. They merely follow the lines of least resistance, letting whatever or whoever comes along interfere with meeting attendance. It takes determined effort to form good habits. Those who let bad weather interfere should consider what our brothers in Nyasaland go through to attend meetings! (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> August 15, 1959, page 510.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> But most of all, failing to be regular in meeting attendance shows a lack of appreciation due to a lack of maturity. It betrays a lack of balance and of being conscious of one’s spiritual need. Just as regular publishers help irregular ones, so regular meeting attenders should be alert to opportunities of aiding those not regularly at the meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>e</sup> Servants can help by making their parts on the program so instructive and interesting that no one would want to miss a meeting. Of course, they can also help by setting a good example as well as by encouraging attendance by precept. In particular are the congregation book study conductors in a position to give irregular ones practical aid, doing so themselves and with the help of others who are regular. If we follow through with these suggestions, no doubt our meeting attendance will greatly improve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> This objection is often raised by sincere Catholics who are following the instructions of their priests to avoid talking to Jehovah’s witnesses. But Jehovah has commanded that they must hear. We want to penetrate such barriers, if possible, in a tactful and discerning way, so that sincere ones will be able to make an intelligent decision and so that we will be “clean from the blood of all men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> You may answer: “I am glad to know that, because I find that Catholic people take their religion seriously. I do, too, and I think all people should make religion more a part of their everyday lives, don’t you? If they did, we certainly wouldn’t have so much delinquency and trouble. Truly religious people would like to see God’s will done on earth, with no more wars and distresses. I know you have prayed the ‘Our Father’ prayer where Jesus instructed us to pray that God’s will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” (Then go on to show how sure this is and what it means.)</span></p>

According to reports the Society has received, the new sermon is proving-very effective. One publisher writes: “The new sermon is a wonder. It holds their interest, and the book is going as fast as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book.

Try the suggestion of starting it at the time the literature is placed by offering to demonstrate how to get the most from the Bible study aids. A publisher who had trouble starting studies tried this method with remarkable results. “It was not a polished job,” she states, “but it worked. Each time it became easier. Jehovah’s blessing was there. While in December I had five studies, in January and February I had ten studies, besides helping to establish four more for other publishers to</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Or you might answer: &quot;Then we have something in common. Everyone is concerned about the growing danger from communism and the threat of increased godlessness. In fact, the Catholic church has issued strong warnings against it. We would like to see peace, with God’s will being done on earth. But whose will is to be done? Will it be that of the communistic dictators? You have no doubt prayed many times: ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth.’ Here in the Scriptures we find that Jesus himself originated this prayer.” (Read Matt. 6:9, 10.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Or you may emphasize Bible reading by referring to Jesus’ model prayer and mentioning that in prayer we are speaking to God, but when we read the Bible God is speaking to us, so Bible study is necessary. In fact, Pope Pius XII, in the foreword of the Douay Bible, agrees with Jerome that &quot;to ignore the Scriptures is.to ignore Christ.” The apostle Peter also wrote two very line letters of instruct'on and told why we must daily meditate on God’s holy Word. —2 Pet. 1 :12, 15,10.</span></p></li></ul>

Use that day to good advantage, arranging morning and afternoon service contacts for the benefit of all. When school begins, children can continue the good effort they make on Labor Day by setting aside regular times to do magazine work on the way home from school. Some who have done this have had good success in establishing routes and easily reach their magazine quotas.</span></p></li>

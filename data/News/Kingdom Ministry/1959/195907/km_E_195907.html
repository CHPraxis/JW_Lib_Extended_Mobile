<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1</sup> Watchmen—sound the warning of Jehovah’s unusual work! “Give them warning from me,’’ commands Jehovah. Tell the people not to scoff, “for there is an extermination . . . for all the land.” We must not fail in this assignment, else the blood of the unwarned ones Jehovah will require at our hands.—Ezek. 3:17, 18, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">AS;</span><span class="font15"> Isa. 28 : 21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> During July effort will be made to carry the warning into unassigned territory. The following-special combination offers will be presented in distant rurals and unassigned territory: the books </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Reyained </span><span class="font15">and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will fie Done on F-’.nrth” </span><span class="font15">which is an excellent offer for all classes of people, on a contribution of $1.25, dropping to the 50c offer of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Fie Done on Earth&quot;</span><span class="font15"> if they do </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font15"> take the two-volume offer. In addition, persons of good will should be encouraged to subscribe for </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> so that spiritual food will be coming to them regularly through the mail throughout the year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Whether to offer the magazines in preference to the two books will be left entirely up to the discretion of the publisher working unassigned territory. But whatever the combination, it should be at least the two subscriptions for $2 or the two bound books for $1.25 or two books for $1, if the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font15"> book is not available. Individual copies of the latest issues of the magazines should be left wherever people are at home, if at all possible. In case no one is at home, it is all right to leave one back issue of each magazine, but no more. This applies only in unassigned territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Those having unassigned territory assignments should care for them well. Make every moment in the territory count. This calls for thorough planning. Someone should scout out the territory in advance. Map out and divide the territory into practical witnessing sections, arrange for a public meeting place, a spot where the Society’s films can be shown, if available, and a </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> study held. Start studies with interested ones on the first call if possible. Continue them by correspondence when no longer able to return. Start early and stay late. Make wise use of your time in unassigned territory, giving warning of God’s unusual work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> As a result of the unassigned territory campaigns thousands have become acquainted with the warning, many isolated groups have been started and even congregations formed. A publisher writes: A subscriber showed interest. “So right there at the first call we asked her if she would like to share with others I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR JULY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark0"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">|“Your Will Be Done on Earth” and? | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one booklet for 50c.</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">| Giving Warning of God’s Unusual ( I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work.—Isa. 28:21,22.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font15">some of the good things she was learning. As a result, she went along with us in the service nearly every week.” A report from Kentucky showed twenty-two cartons of literature placed in two weeks. One sister living twenty-five miles from the nearest town tells about conducting sixteen home Bible studies largely by correspondence. Be careful to note names and addresses of all interested ones and write to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>G</sup> Thus far 328 requests have been received from congregations and thirty-six from regular and vacation pioneers. Remember, too, entire families may vacation pioneer for two weeks or a month or more in unassigned or congregation territory. This year there is more than a 100-percent increase over last year’s vacation pioneer enrollment! If you plan to vacation pioneer in August, put in your application right away. Young ministers, free from school duties, and older publishers, strengthen your hold on true life by entering the pioneer work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Congregations unable to go into unassigned territory can concentrate on working the scattered or little-covered sections in their regular territory. The offer will be </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth&quot;</span><span class="font15"> and a booklet on a 50c contribution. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font15"> booklet can he left as a basis for starting a study, or in Catholic areas </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font15"> is very effective for starting studies. As for the book, do not think it too meaty for good-will persons. It has exciting, easily understood, up-to-date truths as well as deep, thought-stimulating chapters. Ask the householder: “Do you know what will be the result of the East-West conflict? Here’s a book that will tell you”—and it does. Students of the Bible have longed for an understanding of Daniel’s prophecy. Can you think of a better publication than </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span><span class="font15"> to offer them to give them this understanding? Let us become efficient in using our new sermon and move ahead with a positive attitude, declaring Jehovah’s unusual work with this choice instrument.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>s</sup> July means beautiful days and long pleasant evenings. Study conductors should be alert to improve midweek witnessing. Speak to the publishers personally and arrange for midweek contacts at times that are most suitable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> Watchmen of Jehovah, can we conscientiously refuse to respond to the call: “Step over into Macedonia and help us”? Well, then, let us step over and witness to Jehovah’s praise and vindication.—Acts 16:9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">FIRST MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Theme: Giving Warning of God’s Unusual Work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">8 min: Talk on monthly theme. (See “Watchtower,” 3/1/59, p. 134, and 7/1/59, p. 395.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">12 min: Questions and answers on the article “Giving Warning of God’s Unusual Work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">25 min: Congregation prepares sermon. (All should be encouraged to study outline before meeting and have pencil and paper for notes.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(3 min.) Talk by chairman. New book to be offered first time. Contains material vital for all to understand outcome of present struggle for world control and what individuals must do to enjoy earthly blessings under Kingdom. The following new sermon has been field tested with excellent results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(13 min.) Congregation develops sermon under chairman’s direction. Have outline on platform. Discuss introduction as outlined, and then call on audience to develop points. Give special attention to transitions from introduction into the body and from the body into the conclusion and offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theme: “Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A suggested introduction: “My name j<sub>s</sub> ---. I am making a brief, friendly</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">call to discuss a matter that concerns each of us and our family. Today the world is divided into two armed camps <sup>1 </sup>—the East and the West. As we all know, both have completely different ideas and want their will done on earth so strongly that many fear a terrible third world war will result. Have you not wondered just whose will is to be done on earth, whether the East’s, the West’s or someone else’s, and just how things will work out? Centuries ago a man of authority gave the answer as recorded at Matthew 6: 9, 10.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Taught to pray for God’s will to be done &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 6: 9, 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Kingdom will make possible doing God’s will on earth —Dan. 2: 44</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When God’s will done, wars by man end &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Isa. 2: 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Earth to be filled with happy people doing God’s will —Isa. 65:21-23</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Have book handy, and in conclusion you might say: “To picture conditions that will be here on earth in fulfillment of Isaiah 65, which we just read, note the illustration in this Bible aid ‘Your Will Be Done on Earth,’ which is being-offered to all for only a 50c contribution. Here on page 341 is an illustration of God’s will for men and earth. Won’t it be a pleasure to live then? The first sentence reads . . . [Continue through prayer.] Regarding that kingdom the last sentence of this same paragraph tells us . . . [Read.] The more we learn of God’s will the greater confidence we have in his promises. I know this volume will be of invaluable aid to you. [Hand it to householder, opened to page 341.] Look it over. [Pause a moment.] The copy is yours for the small amount of 50c to help cover printing cost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(6 min.) Publisher selected beforehand gives model sermon and householder takes offer. Arrangements made for back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(3 min.) Chairman encourages all to prepare and use this field-tested, effective sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on 1 Tim. 6: 18 at bottom of page one.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">SECOND MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: New World News Report and encouragement for all to attend assembly. Other announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Questions and answers on the article “Maintain Regularity During July and August.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on Deut. 4: 9 at bottom of page four.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">THIRD MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things,” page 276, from “Requirements of God Extend into Daily Living” through Gal. 6: 1 on the same page. Questions and answers for audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Experiences from 1959 “Yearbook” about training children and the results of such training. Give as a talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Scriptural responsibility of parents to teach children. (Deut. 6: 7) Should not be so busy preaching to outsiders that teaching of own children is neglected. Parents in Basutoland thought children too young to witness, but now are training them, with surprising results. (252) In Indonesia boy of ten years (182) and eleven-year-old girl (183) have effective share in service. In Hawaii children direct new ones to the Kingdom Hall. (174) By their mouths God has “furnished praise.” —Matt. 21: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">23 min: Demonstration on “Aid Children Through Study and Service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Problem in many congregations as many young publishers reflect lack of being taught basic Bible truths by parents. Irregularity in service among children indicates not all parents taking lead in service or regularly training and aiding them in ministry. Parental teaching and training essential so children may make truth their own, grow in accurate knowledge, become qualified ministers. Bible studies with children at home and training in field are responsibility of dedicated parents. Congregation servant can encourage parents to carry out program to benefit children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">DEMONSTRATION (14 min.) Congregation servant, having in mind information from “Watchtower,” April 1, 1955, Sept. 1, 1958, and Studies 56 and 66 of “Qualified to Be Ministers,” visits family where children are lax in service, let other interests take up most of time. After showing concern for family’s theocratic progress, tactfully and kindly he discusses how family could develop greater maturity, asks, “Is a Bible study held in the home?” (See Nov., 1957, “Kingdom Ministry”: “Parents, Do You Love Your Children?”) No study being held. They discuss value of study in home to help children gain basic knowledge of Bible truths so they may appreciate need of serving Jehovah. (Deut. 6:6-9; Eph. 6: 1-4) Parents agree this is needed, but ask, “When can we schedule time for it?” Family schedule considered with them. Monday night decided on as best, as all are home. (1956 “Watchtower,” p. 637) Family study promotes togetherness and desire i to make theocratic advancement. Servant discusses family field service record with them. While parents are regular publishers, have not seen need of regularly training children in field. Servant suggests taking children in magazine work on Saturday or perhaps mother can assist after school during week. Parents see possibilities and children show willingness to cooperate. Servant encourages training own children in service, not leaving them for other publishers to assist, although others glad to lend hand. As much need, even more responsibility, to train own children in ministry as there is to train persons of good will. When taken in service children learn to deliver sermons, make back-calls, conduct studies. Wife comments they could practice sermons at home together. Servant suggests better meeting attendance of entire family would aid them in becoming more mature and a happy family unit in the New<sup>7 </sup>World society. As servant leaves, all express appreciation for counsel and</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">DISCUSSION (5 min.) Chairman asks congregation servant if he has recommendations for aiding children where not all in family are in truth. He responds that most ideas in demonstration would apply except dedicated parent would necessarily have to assume much responsibility to aid children. They discuss how others can help where divided families exist. If all families put suggestions in practice, result will be seen in greater maturity of all young ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FOURTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Talk on article “Serving Where the Need Is Great,” and on “Yearbook” experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Publishers that have gone to where the need is great have had many blessings. A grandmother who went to Morocco in North Africa helped a good-will person to publish within a month. (212) A French couple with two children decided to move to where the need was great. Now a congregation is functioning, with seventeen publishers. (156) Many brothers in Nyasaland have responded to the call. (231) A young couple who went to the Virgin Islands are now the happiest they have ever been. (243) A sister in Korea found that she progressed faster spiritually serving where the need is great than when she was with a larger congregation. (195) There are rich blessings waiting for you where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Questions and answers on the article “Congregation Organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">15 min: Discussion by three publishers on a few of the outstanding points from material in the “Watchtower” articles “Pursuing My Purpose in Life” published during the past twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">FIFTH MEETING IN JULY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Congregations having a fifth meeting should arrange their own program. Use the service meeting the week after your Awake Ministers District Assembly to review and discuss assembly I program.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving the Training Program</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> The training program has accomplished very good results during the six years it has been in operation. Many formerly inexperienced publishers have been assisted to be effective publishers and they, in turn, have assisted still others, so that the results are continually multiplied. This has been true in most congregations where the program was given full support. In some congregations, however, reports show that the results have not been as encouraging. This has been due mainly to two factors: The lack of good supervision by the overseer and study conductors, and those assigned not fulfilling their assignments completely.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> What can be done to improve and correct the training program in your congregation? First, the servants, study conductors and publishers must understand thoroughly what the program is and what it should accomplish. It is different in scope from the regular assistance program for new and irregular publishers in that it is a program for giving special attention to less experienced publishers for a period so that they might make rapid progress in likewise becoming effective publishers and might, in turn, instruct still others. Overseers, are there new ones making good progress that can be assigned under the training program? Ascertain who would like to be in the training program and, depending upon the number of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1959 Assemblies—Still Time</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Have you attended one of the Awake Ministers District Assemblies? If you did not attend one in June, there is still time to arrange to attend one in July or August. You may write to the city of your choice for rooming accommodations, but </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">do it now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The spiritual food Jehovah provides is abundant and rich. We want to treat his table with full respect by attending the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font15"> assembly. Rich rewards await all who share in these generous provisions of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Regardless of what assembly you attend, share in the field service scheduled for the first three mornings of the assembly. The assembly theme is “Awake Ministers,” and it is only appropriate that we have some part in the public ministry while we are there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Stay awake by attending one of these assemblies.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15">mature publishers available for training, accommodate all possible, making definite assignments by bringing the two together and discussing the assignment with them as to what is required.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> The overseer and conductors should check regularly with those assigned to see the progress being made and offer suggestions and encouragement. To this end the study conductors should furnish the overseer with a report once a month on each couple in the training program so that he might be kept advised of developments. Keep the training program before the brothers at the service meeting, at service centers and in private conversations. Keep it progressive and up to date.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Now, what can be done by those assigned in the training program to improve in handling their assignments? Do you get together to prepare and rehearse your sermons? Have you made a schedule so that you can share in the various features of service and yet allow for your personal obligations? Consider the assignment as it should be: A God-given one. Fulfill it faithfully. If there is any problem that develops, do not wait for the congregation servant to approach you, but go to him. He is interested in how things are working out and can give appropriate counsel to help. Use this loving provision fully in working for greater maturity and effectiveness in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Announcements</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;0” The week after your congregation attends the Awake Ministers District Assembly, the entire service meeting should be devoted to a review and practical discussion of the things learned at the assembly and the encouraging experiences that were enjoyed. The congregation servant should plan this carefully in advance. If you have already had your assembly, arrange for this meeting early in July. Make whatever adjustments are necessary in the service meeting schedule for the month in order to put on this special program.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintain Regularity During July and August</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> During July and August some Kingdom publishers grow lax in their otherwise good habits of regular service. What does this show? Either lack of appreciation of the glorious treasure of the Kingdom ministry or negligence in reporting. If the latter, let us take reporting more seriously. Why let a little carelessness bear false witness against ourselves, as though we were lacking in appreciation and zeal for Kingdom service? If one fails to report even one month he is counted as an irregular publisher for the next six months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The fact that we usually attend assemblies and/or go on vacations during July and August no doubt accounts for some of this irregularity. While that may explain, it does not justify. Surely if we are alert we can make opportunities for incidental witnessing as we travel. By wearing our convention badges en route to the assembly we will invite opportunities for witnessing. And cannot every one of us engage at least once in some feature of the field ministry while at the assembly?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Are you going on a vacation during July or August? One publisher took booklets with her when she went to a vacation resort. While reading one of them she became engaged in conversation with another vacationer who happened to be from the same city. The result? A study was started and today two of that family are in the truth and one is a pioneer. Such a blessing may be yours if you are awake to opportunities for witnessing while on your vacation!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> When going to another city or town for a vacation why not look up the Kingdom Hall there and meet with the friends there for at least one day of field service with them? They will appreciate having someone join them and you will doubtless find it was the high point of your vacation. If we are away at the end of the month, let us mail our field service reports to the congregation servant in ample time. Let us not be counted irregular due to a failure to report.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Introducing “Your Will Be Done on Earth”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> In presenting this book we want to make our sermon simple, pointed and appealing. A few introductions follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. I am a minister. I have called to share a few minutes with you discussing the divine will for man on earth. The Bible says that the whole duty of man is to ‘fear God and keep his commandments.’ Dp you think that the nations and the majority of men are doing that? [Pause.] However, many do fear God and want to keep his commandments. That is why I have called to speak with you, for God says that those who fear the Lord speak often one with the other. Since the majority of men and nations are not doing God’s will and we see the unhappy results, do you think the time will ever come when all men will do G'od’s will on earth with happy results? The answer is in the model prayer that Jesus taught and which most pray.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> “Good morning. I am discussing with people in your community man’s future in the ‘space age.’ No doubt you have thought much about that. As you know, some men want to conquer space so they can control all people on earth. But would that be good for us? Famous men out of the past have at various times</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving Where the Need Is Great</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Do you feel that your congregation has sufficient territory? Would you like to talk with people who have seldom if ever heard the good news of the Kingdom? Then consider the joys of serving where the need is great. Two families that responded to the call and moved to Utah last year are having splendid experiences. The circuit servant reports that ten studies are being conducted and eight new ones were started during the week of his visit. Twenty-one good-will persons came to see the Society’s film. Now application has been made for a congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> By going to where the need is great you can open up new territories, start new congregations and ruled the whole inhabited earth, but they didn’t make the people happy, did they? Since Bible history shows God’s prophets predicted these conquerors before they came to power, it is worth noting that the Bible also tells us who is destined to rule the earth in our time! From it we can learn how such will affect us and our children—destroy us or make us happy. Notice what these scriptures foretell.” (Turn to Matt. 6:9, 10.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> “Good morning. I am makingbrief religious calls on sincere people who are interested in the answer to the Lord’s prayer [or the ‘Our Father’]. You have often prayed, ‘Thy will be done on earth.’ But because of the worsening conditions in the world many wonder if this prayer is merely a nice dream, for could we really expect God’s will to be done here among men as it is in heaven? Certainly it would be desirable to have God’s will done here on earth through his kingdom. The Bible describes how it will be made possible and what conditions ■would be like at such a time.” (Read Dan. 2:44.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth” and one booklet for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Expressing Loyal Love to God and His Kingdom Heir.——Ps. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">62: 12,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">have the thrill of seeing them grow in numbers and maturity. If. with careful planning, you can arrange your affairs to do so, move to territory where you can be of more service to Jehovah than -with a thriving congregation. When we put Kingdom interests first, Jehovah assures that we will not go without material necessities.—Matt. 6: 25-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> It is not necessary to go to another country to serve where the need is great. There are many places in the United States. The need is great in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. Give the matter serious thought.</span></p>

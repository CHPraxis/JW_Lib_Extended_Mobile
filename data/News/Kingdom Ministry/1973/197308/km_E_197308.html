<p><span class="font11">Can yon imagine the excitement and joy here at Bethel when international assembly time comes around? How many happy reunions there are with former associates! For visiting missionaries, a stop at Bethel is a highlight of their trip. However, many of the 6,000 foreign delegates were seeing Bethel for the first time. Their enthusiasm Impressed upou us the fine privilege we have in serving here at the headquarters of God's grand earthly organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our hearts were warmed by the spiritual appreciation that so many of these visitors from over 26 countries showed. Au East German couple, who had fled to the West, needed new furniture. But they decided, &quot;The old couch and armchair will do until Armageddon.&quot; A chance to see Bethel was more valuable to them. All agreed that the organization here is far vaster than they had pictured. As one Colombian brother put it: &quot;We are so glad to be here and see Bethel with our own eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">.Missionaries anti branch workers have been visiting us from India, Chile, Panama, Kenya, the Philippines, Papua and many other lands. It was thrilling to hear firsthand reports about the work in their lands. For example, missionaries from Kenya told about conditions under the recent ban, but we know they will not be able to strengthen their brothers there any longer. They were given five days to leave. Many of these missionaries expressed heartfelt appreciation for your contributions that made it possible for them to visit their former homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now, as many return from vacations and from attending one or more of these assemblies, there is good reason for all of us to feel invigorated to continue zealously In our work and to apply God’s Word in everything that we do, thus “recommending otu’selves to every human conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be assured of our warm love and our prayers on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Are You Building One Another Up Spiritually?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The past year has seen some tremendous advances in theocratic worship and in the number of those associating actively with Jehovah’s organization. With a Memorial attendance in the United States of 1,046,346, with 33.626 new ones baptized from September through May and a peak to date of 454,770 ministers proclaiming the good news, we can all attest to the fact that Jehovah has opened the floodgates of the heavens and has poured out a rich blessing. (Mal. 3:10) Now in the months ahead we want to assist those associated to grow stronger spiritually. How can we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We can aid one another to share fully in the field ministry. Are you planning to sj&gt;end additional time in the field service during this warm summer month? Had you thought of inviting others to work along with you? This would be a fine way to assist them to enjoy the blessings and happiness that come from sharing the truth with others. And during August we have such a fine offer, one that is easy to present—the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> l&gt;ook. —Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Many who have recently Iteen baptized still need much help to grow stronger spiritually. Are there spiritual matters that you know they need to consider further? Could they sit in on your family study, or could you sit In on theirs as you consider these matters? Ito you need to continue a itersonal Bible study with them? If you studied with them or have associated closely with them, you know many of their spiritual needs and can no doubt do much to assist them. Take the initiative in this. Do they need assistance to share regularly in the field ministry and to make progress? Take them with you. Help them to apply practical suggestions they have heard at the service meeting. You can be sure that your working with them in the field service will be of great encouragement to them. —Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> And, you parents, are you continuing to study regularly with your children? If your children are sharing in the field ministry, do you regularly go with them and help them? They continue to need your association, interest and training. While they may enjoy working in the service with other young folks from time to time, they need to share regularly in the ministry with you, to receive your continued direction and encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We also love our brothers and sisters who have been serving Jehovah for many years and who nowmay not be able to do as much as they used to do. Ito you approach them at the Kingdom Hall? share in conversation with them? express appreciation for their faithful example? When appropriate, do you visit them? Would it help them if you read the Bible or one of the Society’s publications to them? Are there some who need assistance in shopping, or someone to run an errand? Young publishers can often aid older brothers and sisters in some of these ways. Do some rlf’Cd help in getting into the field service? Could you assist with transportation? Or assist by working with them from house to house or on return visits for short periods of time? Would some appreciate your assistance In aiding- them to share in the service by letter writing or by using the telephone?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> There are so many ways that we can build one another up spiritually. “Keep comforting one another and building one another up, just as you are in fact doing,” and may Jehovah’s blessing go with you as you do.—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 12 10 min: Song 5G. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Presenting the Good News— Offering the 'Great Teacher’ Book.” Questions and answers. Also ask audience for further suggestions on how and where they plan to present the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Benefiting from the Life Pattern of Moses, a Servant of Jehovah. Audience participation. Have audience read scriptures and comment on them. Particularly call for comments on how the material applies to us and what we can learn from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Moses is an outstanding example of a humble, faithful servant of Jehovah. Born when Jews were slaves in Egypt. Read Exodus 1:8-10, 12-14, 22. Life of young Moses was preserved. Read Exodus 2:1-10. You can be sure that during those few years Moses’ mother taught her son all she could about Jehovah and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Pharaoh’s court Moses had all the advantages of the 'good life’ the Egyptians—education, wealth, ‘ security.’’ He knew of the struggle the Jews were having in Egypt as slaves. When he saw a certain Egyptian striking a Hebrew brother he took action and thus identified himself as being on the side of Jehovah’s people. Read Exodus 2:11, 12, la. Moses had to flee Egypt. For many years his relatives continued in slavery. Read Exodus 2:23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God called Moses to use him in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. Read Exodus 3:7, 10. Moses felt apprehensive and unqualified for the assignment. Jehovah assured Moses; he was to go in Jehovah’s name and was given extraordinary power. Read Exodus 3:11-13, 15, 16. Briefly summarize Exodus 4:1-9. Jehovah reproved Moses. He gave him the assignment. Read Exodus 4:10-17. While it may not have been an easy assignment for Moses, he went. Under Jehovah’s direction he led Israel out of Egypt and he faithfully taught them God’s law for forty years until his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What can we learn from Moses’ life pattern? Ask audience to comment on the value of each of these lessons.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. We should not let material possessions keep us from doing Jehovah’s will. We need to watch that educational background or financial position does not entice us to be neglectful of carrying out Jehovah’s will, being identified with Jehovah’s people or hesitant to step forward in their behalf.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Parents should follow example of Moses’ mother and train their children well at an early age. Use God’s Word to mold minds of your children and to fortify them. Build a deep love for Jehovah in them, a love for truth and a hatred for what is bad, so they can withstand the pressures of the old system.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. When called upon to handle ‘difficult assignment,’ clo not beg off. Rely on the wisdom and strength Jehovah gives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Remembering Moses can help us as we handle assignments in the ministry school. Our brothers can help us and so can Jehovah if we ask him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. Be courageous in working territory where you see few results from your efforts. Remember Moses’ assignment to go repeatedly to Pharaoh.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">(As time permits, ask audience for other good lessons they have learned from the life pattern of Moses.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include accounts report. Song 59.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 19</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Song 67. Introduction, text and comments, and “Will You Be Away?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Are You Using the “Great Teacher” Book? Demonstration: Family scene with father or mother reading and discussing the book with children. Cover the last four paragraphs in chapter seven.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Chairman: Briefly interview parents. How many times have you been through this book with your children? Why do you feel it is wise to go over the material more than once? How long do you study? (Some parents find it best to study for short periods of time and to study often.) When do you study? (Should be done regularly at convenient times, if possible.) Do you recommend that other parents study regularly with their children? Why? Are you and other family members having success in offering the book to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Consideration of “Watchtower” article from June 15 issue “Motivated by a Godly Conscience.&quot; This can be handled by a talk or a discussion between elder and ministerial servant, or by family group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments. Encourage good support of field service as individual circumstances permit. Include appropriate items from “Announcements&quot; and “Theocratic News.&quot; Song Gl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Song 70. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: September’s Offer, the “Evolution” Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(4 min.) Make brief comments on value of this book in the field ministry. Highlight especially chapters 12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(6 min.) Call on audience to comment on how they will present it and portions of the book they will draw to attention of householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ask for suggestions of parents and children on offering the publication at school, to teachers and students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Question Box. Discuss reasons for zealous share in field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Gideon and the Faithful Three Hundred. Use audience to read scriptures, comment on them and make personal application of the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Gideon became one of the judges in Israel after the death of Joshua and before there were kings in Israel. Israel was not holding to true worship; so Jehovah permitted them to become oppressed by Midian. Jehovah chose Gideon. Read Judges 6:1, 7-12, 15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah called on him to tear down an altar of Baal belonging to his father Joash and to erect an altar to Jehovah. Read Judges 6:25-27. The men of the city were incensed; they wanted to put Gideon to death. However, his father countered that they should let Baal come to his own defense if he could. Read Judges 6:28-31. Though the assignment was not easy, Gideon proved himself to be an obedient worshiper of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the Midianites came to make war against Israel, Jehovah’s spirit moved Gideon to gather forces to defend Israel. But it was not by great numbers that Jehovah would deliver Israel. Read Judges 6:34: 7:2-4, 7. Jehovah gave Gideon further assurances. Read Judges 7:9-15. Gideon acted with faith, and Jehovah gave victory. Read Judges 7:16-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What do we learn from the faithful course followed by Gideon and the three hundred? Invite audience to comment on the following points.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Gideon put faith in Jehovah and his ability to save: we need to do this too. Israel was doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. Baal worship predominated. Gideon had to be very loyal to Jehovah to follow the command to tear down the Baal altar belonging to his father and to champion true worship of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. We today often face great obstacles in our territory where false religion has a strong hold on people. We need faith like that of Gideon and need to act obediently in spiritual warfare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Gideon was called upon to exercise further faith in that Jehovah was using a group small in number to accomplish his will. He was told to send home all in army who were afraid and trembling; 22,000 went home, leaving 10,000. The force was further reduced to 300, which left odds of 450 to 1. Gideon’s obedience showed implicit trust in Jehovah. Today we face similar odds in our Christian ministry, our spiritual warfare. As we continue our ministry faith J fully we, too, need to show implicit trust in Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. The weapons Gideon and the three hundred had were a horn, a large empty jar and a torch. Jehovah was the one who gave final victory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Today the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. Rather, we use the truth, the good news of peace, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit, which is God’s Word, to cut away false religious teachings and then to build up appreciation for true worship.—Eph. 6:10, 14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">6. Gideon’s attitude about prominence is an example to us. Read Judges 8:22, 23. It is important that we keep our relative positions inside Jehovah’s organization and always seek to exalt our God Jehovah rather than ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. Include Branch Letter. Song 116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Song 108. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Are You Building One Another Up Spiritually?” Questions and answers. Audience may be invited to comment on additional ways they can build up one another locally. Mention literature offer for September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Consideration of “Watchtower” article of July 1, 1973, “Conscientious in Doing Good Toward All&quot; by one or two elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments. Encourage the brothers to be alert to opportunities to present the “Evolution” book to all who will hear. Song 110.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For Attention of Elders</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">The body of elders will no doubt want to hold their September meeting early in the month. Listed below are some matters that will need attention. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book, pages 67-69. 72.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Are there brothers who now qualify to be recommended as ministerial servants? If so, please use the S-2 form to make these recommendations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Are there ministerial servants who now qualify to be recommended as elders? (Unless a brother has moved into the congregation and was an appointed elder in the previous congregation, normally one would not be recommended as an elder now unless he lias first served as a ministerial servant.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Are there any elders or ministerial servants not measuring up to the Scriptural qualifications who should be recommended for removal? Are there any who have moved or died and whose names have not yet been deleted? If so, please provide this information on the S-2 form under ‘‘Deletions.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. The normal rotation system is outlined on page 67 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organi-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Be Away?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Will you he away from home during August? Are you planning to attend the Kingdom Hall in the area where you will visit? You will no doubt find, as others have, that meeting with the brothers, attending the meetings with them and sharing in Hie service with them will Ite high points of your trip. And, of course, this will keep you strong spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Re alert to share in the Kingdom service wherever possible. This can Ite done even when yon are traveling. Carry a good supply of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Oreat Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book and copies of other twenty-five-cent publications. Take along new and older copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines. They can be left with relatives, friends and new acquaintances. One brother said that when he and his family travel, they offer new magazines for a contribution, or leave older copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> at gas stations and restaurants where they stop. The family takes turns presenting them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If you will not l&gt;e back home before the end of the month, please mail your field service report back to the field overseer so that your activity can be included with the congregation’s report to the Society for August. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">zation</span><span class="font11"> book. If some elders are not able to care for the responsibility that would be theirs according to the regular pattern of rotation, the body of elders will decide what will be best under the circumstances, still recognizing the rotation arrangement.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5. When the body of elders has determined who will be the new presiding overseer, who will serve as field overseer, Bible study overseer, etc., announcement can then be made to the congregation. When the announcement is made to the congregation the brothers can then begin caring for their new responsibilities. However, if the body of elders</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">♦ It has been brought to our attention that in some congregations the length of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study is exceeding an hour by as much as fifteen or more minutes on many weeks. It would be best ordinarily to keep the study itself within an hour, with about ten additional minutes for the opening and closing, as outlined in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font9"> book, page 94. </span><span class="font11">has in mind using a brother who is newly being recommended to the governing body for appointment as an elder, they should wait until such appointment is received before making any definite assignment. (Tlie congregation will not receive a letter from the Society appointing brothel's to serve in various positions of oversight. Rather, the present presiding overseer, using the S-10 form, will inform the Society which brothers will be serving on the committee. The Society will send a letter covering only new appointments of elders and ministerial servants and also deletions.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">6. If It seems beneficial to shift any book study conductors from one study group to another, this can be considered. Local circumstances should be taken into consideration in determining whether this will be advisable or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">7. Review the various assignments of the ministerial servants and make whatever adjustments, if any, may seem advisable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">8. The present presiding overseer should prepare Ids report on the congregation for the branch office. This should be read to the elders at their meeting in September. Then it should be typed or printed on the S-10 form and sent to the Society. A copy should be retained for the congregation files.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Brothers who are now serving in various capacities will kindly aid the brothers who will soon be taking over these responsibilities. A smooth transition of oversight, will benefit all in the congregation. We look to Jehovah to bless the arrangements for the coming year to his glory and honor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN MAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">May proved to be another outstanding month of field service in the 1973 service year. There were 446,730 of us who shared in the Kingdom service and over million copies of Bibles and Bible publications were left in the homes of the people. And, just think, in each piece of literature is information that can help people to gain life. Additionally, 3,084,180 return visits were made and 300,255 home Bible studies were conducted. How privileged we are to be able to honor Jehovah by sharing in Kingdompreaching each month!</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering the ‘Great Teacher' Book</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Do you like to hear stories? — Well, then, I'm going to tell you one about a man who told better stories than anyone else who has ever lived on earth. His name is Jesus Christ.” Does that sound familiar to you? Those are the opening words of the first chapter of the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher.</span><span class="font11"> To date there have been ten million copies of this fine publication printed in twelve languages. During August we are once again going to feature it in our field ministry. Are you prepared to use it in the Kingdom activity? It is assisting young and old to learn the truth of God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The Kingdom activity takes in many different features of opr ministerial work. We will, of course, want to use this publication in the house-to-house ministry, offering it for twenty-five cents. When you offer magazines, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher </span><span class="font11">book can be offered with the latest </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> for thirty-five cents. Some of you will want to use it in your street magazine work. One circuit overseer recently informed the Society of an experience he had in this activity: He approached an elderly lady who was walking down the Street and in the course of the conversation asked, &quot;Do you have any grandchildren?” She replied: &quot;I have a number of them.” He took out four </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> books and told her: “I have just what you need to help these young folks.” And he briefly explained the book. She was happy to contribute for them for her grandchildren. This circuit overseer observed : ‘Parents and grandparents get this book for their children, and it is just what they need to help these young folks to get on the way of everlasting life.’ In a month’s time this circuit overseer and his wife placed 470 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> books with interested ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When we go from house to house and find that in a family there are several children, why not suggest to the parents, or to the grandparents if you speak to them, that they obtain a copy of the book for each child to read; the cost is so small, and children appreciate having their own copy. No doubt many children who get the publication will want to know more about what they read, and this may open up the way for you to discuss the truth with other members of the family. Offer the book everywhere you can. Any of the other twenty-five-cent publications can be offered if your supply of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book becomes exhausted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There are other fields to consider too. How about friends and relatives with children? Would you like to give them the book as a gift? You may wish to write a small message of a personal nature on the front page of the book when making such a gift. Such kindness and thoughtfulness will no doubt be deeply appreciated by many. And those who take time to read the book will be richly blessed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do not hesitate to offer the book to adults for their reading. Many will appreciate its direct, easy-to-understand language and may be aided to get a clear grasp of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Whether you are young in years, or an adult, keep in mind those who have shown interest and let them know that they can enjoy a free home Bible study. Many young publishers will find it possible to conduct Bible studies in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book. One young publisher six years of age is regularly conducting a study with one of her schoolmates who is seven years of age. This young publisher observed how her mother conducted Bible studies and how she used the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book to read to her, so she is following her mother’s example in reading it with her young schoolmate. Could some of you young publishers do the same and read the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book with some of your schoolmates?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> “Will you listen to the Great Teacher? — That is what we all should do. We will be happy If we do. And it will also bring us happiness if we tell our friends the good things we learn.” These concluding words of chapter one of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book encourage all of us to share fully in the Kingdom activity now.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">• If field service reports are received after the congregation’s report has been sent to the Society, how should they be handled?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">It would be very helpful if all reports could be turned in promptly at the end of each month. Some publishers keep a field service report in the back of their Bible or songbook or other convenient place. It is the” on hand to make note of field service activity each time they have a share and it is also with them at the Kingdom Hall at the end of the month when the report should be turned in. Do what you can to turn your report in on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But what if you forget or find it will be late? Please turn your report in anyway. The field overseer will record the activity on your Publisher s Record card for the proper month— the month during which you shared in the service. And he will include your activity in the congregation’s next report to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If, for example, a publisher turns in a late report for his activity during July and then turns in his August report on time, all of his activity would be included in the congregation’s August report. Would this one be counted twice as a publisher in August? Yes, because he was not counted as a publisher in July. This will provide the Society with a complete report, and the averages at the end of the year will be correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some elders have asked if there is any objection to personally approaching publishers, when this is necessary, reminding them to turn in their reports at the end of the month. Often when field overseers and book study conductors approach the brothers and remind them to turn in their reports at the end of the month, a complete report is available to send to the Society. And you can be sure that the brothers you remind will appreciate your help and interest in them.</span></p>

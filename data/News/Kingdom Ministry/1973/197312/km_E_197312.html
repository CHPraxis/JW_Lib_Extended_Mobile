<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 1973 “But'we, for our part, shall walk In the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.”—Mie. 45. VOL. XVI NO. 12</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Q)ea/t kingdom</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">When September 21 arrived—the day to commence distribution of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font13"> No. 16—enthusiasm was running high in the congregations everywhere. During the days that followed, it was not only those who were already publishers who turned out for field service. Increasing numbers of persons are convinced that time is running out for unbelieving mankind. Moved by a desire to share with others the good news of God’s kingdom, 512,738 participated in the work and then turned in reports, just here in the forty-eight states! That is 40,076 more than were in the field in August, during which month 54,269 more had .already reported than for the preceding August. Isn’t that grand? What a marvelous increase in the number of persons who are indicating their desire to walk in Jehovah’s name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And they exerted themselves. Hours devoted to the field ministry shot up to nearly 2 million more than for August. Besides that, 30,000 enrolled as temporary pioneers, and there was an increase of 1,549 in the ranks of regular pioneers. Reports show that, all together, 43,320,048 copies of the message “Is Time Running Out for Mankind?” were distributed here in the United States. Many publishers in city territory placed their allotment within a few days; in rural areas more effort was required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was not only in this country that increase was evident. During September, France showed an increase of 2,900 publishers; Japan, 1,200; Korea and the Netherlands, 1,000 each; the British Isles, 5,100; Canada, 3,700; Germany, 2,600; Spain, 900. Although the peak for the 1973 service year was 1,758,429 publishers world wide, it is evident that already we have moved up over the 1,810,000 mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As we proceeded with our work in September, the dividing effect of the message was evident. Some persons made phone calls to voice</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Walk in the Name of Jehovah&quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom News No. 17 to Be Distributed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup>Most of the people of the world walk in a certain course set by this system of things. Different groups have their own paths. This is because ‘all the peoples, for their part, walk each one in the name of its god.’ These false gods are leading them to one place—a disastrous fight against Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> “But,” the scripture goes on, making a sharp contrast, “we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God.” (Mic. 4:5) Only people on this path will avoid collision with God. Jehovah’s witnesses, on this path themselves, want as many as possible to find their disapproval. Others wanted to learn more. In quite a few cases householders read the tract and then ran down the street after the publisher to request a Bible study. Here in Brooklyn we received 2,995 coupons from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, News </span><span class="font13">requesting bound books, and 596 asked that someone call on them to discuss the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Now the time is near for distribution of another </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News. </span><span class="font13">In some parts of the country the weather will not be as favorable as in September. But the importance of the work has not diminished. By boldly and zealously sharing in the distribution of the pointed message “Has Religion Betrayed God and Man?” we can demonstrate to Jehovah our love for him, our desire to see his name cleared of the reproach brought upon it by false religion, and our determination to walk in his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Who will share in the work? Will all 512,738 who shared in September be out again, and perhaps even more? May Jehovah richly bless all who thus display that they uphold true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Your fellow servants,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font13">it, so that these may get out of the deadly rut they are in.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The only way the people can change paths is for them to see the deadly folly of their ‘gods,’ the falsity of their religion and the peril to which it leads them. Then they must see the true God, Jehovah, and appreciate what walking in his name means. For these reasons, it is recommended that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font13">No. 17 be placed in as many homes as possible in each congregation’s territory during the ten days of December 22-31. By our courageously sharing in this work we will give evidence that we really are walking in the name of Jehovah, the God of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As its front page indicates, the tract answers the question “Has Religion Betrayed God and Man?” Consider the effect this headline will have: If a person is sighing and groaning over the detestable things done in the name of religion, or if he views himself as an enemy of religion or as merely nonreligious, the headline may arouse his curiosity, and the contents of the tract will be a real eye-opener for him. If the householder is a religious person, the very question raised in the headline may make him think; he may call to mind some doubts about practices in his own church, and so read what the tract says.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Of course, not </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font13"> religion has betrayed God and man. The reader will be presented with this truth and will have an opportunity to see the contrast between the true religion and the false. Readers are encouraged to action, and the positive seeking and practicing of true worship are stressed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> A short presentation will be sufficient, such as, “I have volunteered to share in a worldwide distribution of this tract. It is free.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">pray to God, lean on him and confidently look for his help. In the meantime, if we do not forsake our place in his arrangement, we will be able to endure with joy and be delivered. —Jas. 5:11; Phil. 1:27, 28; 2 Pet. 2:9. 13 min: Field overseer reviews arrangements for tract distribution for coming week. Emphasize special united effort on December 22 and 23. Brief presentations demonstrated. Discuss how to handle situations in local territory to achieve thorough coverage. </span><span class="font1">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Discuss arrangements for field service on Tuesday, December 25. If all tracts have been distributed, use books or magazines. (Draw attention of publishers to first article in December 22 “Awake!” also opening article in January 1 “Watchtower.”) Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 12. Introduction, text and comments. (Include appropriate Announcements on page 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Several elders and/or ministerial servants discuss the article in the December 1, 1973, issue of “The Watchtower” entitled “Jehovah Brings ‘Sealing’ of His Chosen Ones to a Close.” This discussion should not imply criticism of any who profess to be of the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">18 min: “Sign of World’s End Means Kingdom Blessings Near.” Suggested presentation for “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(12 min.) Audience discussion of presentation. Most “Watchtower” issues during four-month campaign will have articles taking up different features of “sign” of end. Can build presentation around current article, whichever feature of “sign” is discussed. Might say (using article on “Why Call at My Door?” after introducing self): “I am calling on you and your neighbors— in fact—all over the world this home visitation is being made, to find people who are disturbed by the bad conditions in the world. There is a lot of fear, particularly because of the increase of crime. They ask, ‘What is this world coming to?’ How do you feel about it? [Let them answer.] We can get the answer and can know •where the world is heading. After describing the events of our day, the greatest prophet of all time said: [Read or paraphrase Luke 21:28.] Why could we have such confidence? Jesus went on to say: [verses 31, 32].” (Or, use Matthew chapter 24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;[Take out January 1 “Watchtower” and open to page 3.] This article in ‘The Watchtower’ shows the meaning of what is happening, and the marvelous prospect of survival into a righteous earth under God’s Kingdom rule. It is to share this good news that Jehovah’s witnesses call on people in all parts of the earth. [Turn to page 5.] The facts show that the thousandyear reign of God’s kingdom is immediately ahead of us, and we urge everyone to examine the evidence. ‘The Watchtower’ is published twice a month. During the coming year it will present much information from the Bible on God’s kingdom—what .kind of government it is, who are its rulers and how it will help earth’s inhabitants to make earth a paradise garden, eliminating all racial and national divisions. Here are some of the subjects to be treated in forthcoming</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Song 62. Introduction, text and comments. Include discussion of Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “How Is Your Personal Study Program?” Handle as discourse. Receive expressions from audience on things that have threatened to disrupt good study program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">18 min: “Walk in the Name of Jehovah.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Song 96. Introduction and brief comments on text. Discuss Branch Letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Jeremiah’s Endurance. Let audience read scriptures, comment and make personal application (as time permits).</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jeremiah was one of the 'great cloud of witnesses’ from whose course we can draw much encouragement. (Heb. 12:1) First of all, he came to realize that his strength was from Jehovah.—Jer. 1:6, 18, 19; 20:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jeremiah was bold and fearless in Jehovah’s strength, but he also had real concern for the people. He felt compassion and also expressed love for them when they suffered for their sins. (Jer. 8:21-9:1) He declared Jehovah’s warning and judgment message ■without stint, yet had at heart his commission also “to build and to plant.”—Jer. 1:10; 38:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jeremiah became discouraged because of the bitter opposition, but he loved God’s Word and held on to it. He never turned away from his commissioned work. He was encouraged by Jehovah and was delivered.—Jer. 20:8, 9, 11; 40:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What are some things we can learn from Jeremiah’s record that apply to our lives? <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">2</a></sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Humility and trust in Jehovah. We must realize, that we are doing his work, not our own. He loves us and will give us the strength and ability to keep serving faithfully. —Jas. 4:6, 10; Eph. 6:10; 1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Boldness, courage. God does not want us to tremble before our opponents and fail to sanctify his name. We, in turn, do not want to “water down” God’s message or be timid or hold back in declaring the truth. —Acts 4:29; Josh. 1:7-9; Ps. 27:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Love for our brothers and for other people. Our attitude means much. We are like a “clashing cymbal” if we are not motivated by love. We must keep in mind our purpose “to build and to plant”—to help people.—1 Cor. 13:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Like Jeremiah, it is not unusual for us to get discouraged at times by opposition, indifference or adverse circumstance. (2 Cor. 1:8-10) We must issues.” (Read from box of articles to come.) “During the year you and your family can receive these and much other fine Bible knowledge. The ‘Watchtower’ subscription rate is only §1.50 for the year. I will be happy to arrange for you to have ‘The Watch-tower’ come to your home.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">(6 min.) Have the presentation demonstrated. Do not go off into side issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Concluding comments. Discuss the final weekend of work with the tract. If any have more tracts than they can distribute by December 31, ask them to turn these extras in NOW so that others can use them. Comment on arrangements for going back into the same territory with the subscription offer from and after January 1. Carry copies of “Peace and Security” book, -which was advertised on tract. Outline arrangements for witnessing on January 1. Song 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Song 5. Introduction, text and comments. Include discussion of some points of interest from pages 3-16 of the “1974 Yearbook.” Cover highlights and encourage brothers to read the “Yearbook” regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Experiences in distributing tracts. Discuss importance of having time set aside regularly each week to share in field service. Offer personal help to newer ones in other features of field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Concluding comments. Remind all to turn in field service reports and to include at the bottom a note showing how many copies of Kingdom News No. 17 were distributed. Include discussion of Question Box. Song 66.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Song 31. Introduction, text and comments. Include discussion of some points of particular interest on pages 17-32 of “1974 Yearbook.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">12 min: &quot;Keep Your Minds Fixed on the Things Above.” (Col. 3:2) Talk based on published material under “Questions from Readers” in the August 15, 1973, issue of “The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: Presenting Subscription Offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(5 min.) Read with publishers lefthand column of page 2 of current “Watchtower.” Show how paragraphs 2 and 3 could be used in obtaining subscriptions. The final paragraph could be used to suggest a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(10 min.) Demonstrate suggested sermon. (See meeting for -week of December 23.) After scripture presentation, pause and state that we could show value of magazine in a number of ways. Publisher continues, reading a paragraph from page 2 of magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then another publisher steps up and, to same householder, demonstrates just the concluding part of the presentation, but tying in the article “Can Those Faithful to God Conceal the Truth?” Show that the preaching of Bible truth is part of the “sign.” Also refer to box listing articles in coming issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">14 min: Concluding comments. Include discussion of “Do You Leave a Handbill?” Song 32.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How Is Your Personal Study Program?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do you find that other things sometimes interfere with your program for personal and family study? If so, your experience is not unique. Every one of Jehovah’s servants has to fight against timeconsuming encroachments and the imperfections of the flesh in order to devote sufficient time to personal study. Do you have a good arrangement going now? If so, fine! But if your good intentions have flagged somewhat and you are back to irregular study habits, now is the time to get back to a good schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What can be done? Well, first it would be good to review just why it is so important to do personal study. Dor one thing, if you are trying to get by with only what you can get at the meetings, without doing personal study, your spiritual health will soon reflect your neglect. It is somewhat like a home Bible study you might conduct for which the student just does not prepare his lesson. Because appreciation is lacking, his progress is very slow. To grow spiritually we have to put forth personal effort and think deeply about the application of God’s Word in our own lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Convinced of the importance of regular personal study, you will have the incentive to stick by a good routine. Many families reserve at least one night each week for studying together and preparing for meetings and refuse to let anything interfere with the arrangements. Additionally, there are other times that can be redeemed </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">individually</span><span class="font13"> for reading a portion of the Bible, an article in one of the magazines or a few pages in one of the books. While riding a bus to work, while waiting for an appointment, during the lunch break—yes, there are many opportunities to do-personal reading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> At Proverbs 2:1-5, we are told that in paying attention to wisdom</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Leave a Handbill?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">What do you do when a person is so busy you do not have time even to offer the magazines? Suppose someone does not take any literature after you speak with him about the truth? And what do you do when there is no one at home? Handbills are designed to fill the need in these and many other situations. Do you always carry handbills with you and try to leave them at every home? Often they can give a witness when you cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In addition to handbills that adand calling out for understanding and discernment, seeking it as for hid treasures, we will “understand the fear of Jehovah” and “find the very knowledge of God.” We cannot have this proper “fear of Jehovah” and “knowledge of God” unless we study his Word. If we really get the impact of his Word, we will not try to beg off from what God requires or try to get around what the Bible clearly shoys we should do. We will ask ourselves as we read and study, What does this mean in my life? If it does not mean anything, why not? For example, the father, instead of conducting a routine ‘ask the question, get the answer’ study with his children, might lovingly get expressions on how the Scriptural encouragement and counsel will affect how they will conduct themselves in school.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Do you find that your comprehension is somewhat slower than that of others? Do you read at a slower pace, perhaps not quite getting everything read before something new comes out? Do not let this worry you. With practice, there may be ways you can improve your ability to read and comprehend, but the important thing is to have regular and definite times set aside to do personal study. And make it your objective to enjoy it to the full. In seeking understanding of what you read, see how the points learned fit in with what you already know.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We should not hesitate to get into the deeper things of God’s Word. Paul admonished: “Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5: 13, 14) Personal study plays a vital part in growth to maturity, and in keeping ourselves strong spiritually and properly equipped for Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

One man, after being disillusioned with several churches, prayed one night: ‘Dear God, if there is a God, help me to find the religion that is right.’ The next morning he noticed a handbill left earlier at his door when no one was at home. He accepted the invitation thereon to attend the Bible lecture at the Kingdom Hall. How glad he and his family are now that one of God’s Christian witnesses left that handbill. Try to leave at least a handbill at every door.</span></p>

Twice a month for the next twelve months, a message comes to that home that could aid the members of that household to get everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The articles published in the magazines are specially designed, not only to feed Jehovah’s people spiritually, but also to appeal to and impress right-hearted ones of the public. Do not assume that some articles in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">will be too difficult for the public. If you go back through the issues we have received during the past year, for instance, how many do you find that the public could not understand? Even the deeper articles are readable and understandable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> During the four months of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign we will look for opportunities for offering subscriptions in every direction, but particular attention will be focused on certain opportunities each month. In January, appropriately we will devote much time to the actual house-to-house work with the subscription offer. Then in February, we will continue with house-to-house work, but we will also focus attention on making return</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">“Walk in the Name of Jehovah&quot; (Cowi’d) We are leaving one in every home. Please read it.” Or, “The reason I am here is to give you a brief printed message. It is free. Please read it.” We want the individual to read the tract rather than listen to a sermon from us on this visit. The less we say, the more likely the person will be to read the tract. However, we should be warm and friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> The distribution this month takes place during the holiday season when many are free from secular work for a few days and young ones are out of school. We encourage all publishers to have a full share. The elders can assist all by making special arrangements for group witnessing, as the united effort encourages all. New ones who qualify for field service have here an excellent opportunity for an enthusiastic start. visits where subscriptions might be obtained, including subscription promises and people with whom we conduct studies. In March, we will give special attention to informal witnessing opportunities. And finally in April, we will consider particularly to whom we might send gift subscriptions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Here is something you will want to impress upon your mind so that you will remember it throughout the four-month </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign: The majority of issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> will discuss some feature of the “sign” of Jesus’ presence and the end of this system of things. Watch for these articles and bring points from them into your discussions at the door. Use them in helping people to appreciate the value of having a subscription.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> You will note, too, that the box showing articles to come in the next issue will be expanded to include outstanding articles in several future issues. This you can point to. in showing how a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">subscription will benefit one in the months just ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We encourage all to be subscription conscious during the four months of the campaign. Subscriptions for both magazines are often taken just as readily as a subscription for just one. Try it and see if this is true in your territory!</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Of course, during most of the month we will be offering the Bible and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security —From What Source?,</span><span class="font13"> for a contribution of $1.25. If we still have our copy of the folder on “Bibles and Bible Study Aids,” we can use it to show the people the Bibles and aids we can furnish, such as the large-print Bible and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures.</span><span class="font13"> Also, if you have foreign-speaking people in your territory, keep in mind that the Bible is available in various languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> The nations continue to walk in the names of their gods, but not for much longer. Such false worship is leading them into destruction. We rejoice that many continue to come out of Babylon the Great. Before Jehovah’s patience runs out, it is our privilege to help these to join us in pure worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• What procedure is to be followed by the public meeting , chairman?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The public meeting chairman’s duty is to impart a welcome and relaxed feeling to the audience and to maintain a smooth continuity to the features of the program. Therefore, he should prepare in advance to make his comments serve these purposes. Brevity is the keynote. After a few words of welcome, a song is usually sung, followed by prayer. Usually it is appropriate for the chairman to offer the prayer, but it may be offered by another brother, preferably one designated beforehand. (“or,&quot; pp. 95, 96) Then the chairman states the title of the talk and introduces the speaker. Since those attending know that it is a religious meeting, with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, a minister, as speaker, it is inappropriate to introduce the speaker as “Mister.&quot; It is customary to refer to him as “Brother ---.” If he is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">visiting speaker, the chairman may want to state the name of the congregation with which the speaker is associated. There is no need to state his qualifications, nor to specify how long the speaker will talk. Primarily, the subject of the talk should be distinctly stated so that the audience clearly understands it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After the talk, the comments should also be very brief. The subject of next week’s talk may be announced, with an invitation to attend. If the “Watchtower” study follows the talk, the subject to be studied may be announced and the audience encouraged to remain and enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By being brief and to the point the chairman’s comments do not detract from or cause duplication of the speaker’s introduction or conclusion. The audience hears what they came to hear, namely, the discourse by the speaker, and the chairman does not run the meeting overtime.</span></p>

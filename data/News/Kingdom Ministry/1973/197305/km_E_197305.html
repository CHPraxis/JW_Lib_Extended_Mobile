<p><span class="font14">We wish you could have been with us at the, Bethel breakfast table when Brother ■ Knorr told us about his recent trip through South America. Jie and Brother Larson had just completed a seventeen-day trip to eight of the Society’s branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Everywhere they went, more persons had been baptized so far this year than for the same period last year. Expansion of printing facilities was needed. In Colombia arrangements were made during their visit to enlarge the printing operations there. In Peru and Venezuela plans were laid for expanding the branch facilities, in order to handle the increasing flow of publications needed to equip the brothers for their ministry. In Argentina the present branch building is being enlarged, and another large building was purchased. The number of publishers has been growing rapidly there, and it is hoped that much more printing can be done right in the country. It was thrilling to hear about all these plans for expansion, especially in view of what it means in terms of accomplishing the vital “marking” of foreheads during the short remaining time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A highlight of the trip was the dedication of the enlarged factory and Bethel home in Brazil. The plane on which they were traveling was delayed, but the brothers arrived just in time for the program in Sao Paulo. Brother Knorr spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of 1,376 who were present for the dedication that evening, and then to 28,919 at a special meeting the next morning. With their new facilities, the 75,000 publishers in Brazil should now receive their magazines on a far more regular basis than was possible with international shipping of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In most of the countries where they stopped on their trip, Brother Knorr was also working out details concerning the forthcoming “Divine Victory” International Assemblies in those lands. Here in North America those assemblies begin just next</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving with a Sense of Urgency!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The work of gathering in the “other sheep” is going ahead at a fast pace. Already in the first five months of this service year, 69,838 world wide have become dedicated, baptized disciples of Jesus Christ. In the continental United States alone, 21,822 have taken this important step in the last six months. And the month of February ?aw more Kingdom proclaimers in the field ministry here than ever before—a total of 436,459, an increase of 5,280! To supply the needs that have arisen due to worldwide increases, the Bethel family has been kept very busy. Think of it, 14,547,882 bound books and a total of 115,539,350 magazines have been produced in the Society’s factories in New York in just six months !</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> It is a joy to see that the efforts put forth by our brothers and sisters here in the United States give evidence of a genuine interest in getting the “good news” proclaimed in these “last days.” In February, though it was a wintry month in some areas, 6,117,302 hours were devoted to the field ministry, 611,000 more than a year ago. Also magazine placements increased by 907,000. Truly these magazines can be instrumental in opening up the hearts of individuals to respond to the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> As we see what is happening today, we cannot help but have a feeling of urgency. We know that Jesus Christ is already ruling over month, in June. What a grand spiritual feast there will be! Don’t miss any of it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Truly, these are thrilling days in which to be alive and serving our Grand Creator. May all of us share to the full in the work that he has given us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We send our warm love to all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font14">the “kingdom of the world.” We are living deep in the “time of the end.” The fulfillment of prophecy points unmistakably to the approaching destruction of Babylon the Great. Does this not fire us with zeal to get around our territory as often as possible? Yes, we want people to learn the truth NOW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> People everywhere need to be made aware of Jehovah’s grand purpose for mankind. They must be helped to see that a decision must be made as to whether they really want God’s kingdom or prefer the pleasures of this world and submission to the “god of this system of things.” (2 Cor. 4:4) The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise-Theocracy</span><span class="font14"> book is an excellent means by which to place this issue before them. During May we will therefore want to use every opportunity to place this publication along with a booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> The more time we spend in house-to-house work and the more we are alert to opportunities to share in informal witnessing, the more people we will be able to help to learn the truth. People living in the territory are our neighbors. All of them are in great spiritual need. To help all we can, we must view each one as an individual, not judging the territory as a whole. (Luke 10:36, 37) Keeping in mind that we are bearing Jehovah’s name and making known his message for a witness, regardless of the response, we can have real satisfaction in knowing that we are doing the divine will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Warmer weather and longer days may provide opportunities to share in evening witness work, also increased street witnessing. One 87-year-old pioneer sister in New York State regularly places 1,500 magazines a month by offering them on the street. Many have had excellent results in approaching persons waiting in cars at shopping centers.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> To succeed in accomplishing something, it helps greatly to set a goal for ourselves. A goal is something to strive for, and when achieved, it results in satisfaction, especially when the goal involves our service to God. (Eph. 5:15-17) Many of us have set as a personal goal to temporary pioneer one time or more each year, to join the ranks of regular pioneers, to become a special pioneer or a member of the Bethel family, to serve where the need? is greater, to attend Gilead and thereafter serve as a missionary, etc. Think of the added blessings that those who have realized such goals have experienced in their lives!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font14"> book we do not find a set goal of hours for all publishers, nor set goals for return visits, magazine placements or Bible studies. Why not? Because our individual circumstances, condition of health, abilities, etc., vary greatly. Not all of us are able to do the same amount, and, as we know, the </span><span class="font12">with “Rejecting College Education to Pioneer” through to the end of the section on “Willingness to Give Up Seeming Material Advantages.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">10 min: Offer the “New World, Translation” and “Great Teacher” book. Encouraging talk for all to share in field ministry during June. Make the month of June a real Bible study month. Remember that we have, not only the regular edition, but also a large-print edition, as well as “The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures.” Use the folder on “Bibles and Bible Study Aids” to acquaint people with these. In carrying out our field activity, we will try to encourage all people to read the Bible. People might say they have a Bible, read it and are not interested in a copy of the “New World Translation.” Such a householder can be informed of the “Aid” book. Show the person the sample in your folder. In some cases, you may want to arrange a return visit to show the householder your copy and how we use it, and tell him that, if he so desires, one can be ordered for him. We can also offer to interested householders “Make Sure” for 75c. Brothers can carry their own copy of “Make Sure” with them. Then if people say they have a Bible, we can offer the householder something that will help him to understand the Bible. Appreciating the importance, of the Bible study work, encourage all to start studies at every opportunity.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">You Set a Personal Goal?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">response on the part of the public is not the same in all areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> However, would it not be good for each of us individually to set a goal for our own field ministry, to determine personally how much time we can reasonably spend in field service each month and work out a schedule accordingly? Similarly, we can establish a personal goal for magazine placements, return visits, anti even the number of Bible studies we wish to conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> A publisher recently stated: ‘When the Society had a goal of twelve magazines a month for us as publishers, and I saw near the end of the month I was short on magazine placements, often I would arrange to spend a little more time in magazine service so as to enjoy the satisfaction of placing twelve or more magazines a month.’ He observed that when the goals were discontinued, his field service time dropped and he was not putting forth the same effort to place twelve magazines a month. lie decided to</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Congregations that do not receive the June “Kingdom Ministry” in time may make up their own program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some congregations report that at times </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> supplies are received late. This is to advise that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> supplies are mailed on the 15th or 16th of each month.

<p><span class="font14">set personal field service goals for himself, and as a result he has increased the time he spends in field ministry and again enjoys a greater part in magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Goals are wholesome for us as individuals. They provide us opportunity to manifest good desires, according to “the arrangings of the heart” which Jehovah lovingly allows his human creatures to develop according to choice. And when one’s heart ‘thinks out its way,’ setting reasonable goals in God’s service, then “Jehovah himself does the directing of his steps.” (Prov. 16: 1, 9) Yes, Jehovah will bless our efforts to meet such goals. Our desire is to please Jehovah by sharing as fully as we can in kingdompreaching and the disciple-making work. Goals can aid us to accomplish this. Would it not be good, then, with all of us recognizing the urgency of the times, individually to consider again our circumstances and to work out for ourselves reasonable personal goals for field service?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>What Is Your Heart's Desire?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">J</span><span class="font0">EHOVAH God does not hold anyone back from following his heart’s desire. We are free to choose what appeals to our hearts and what delights our eyes. Wise King Solomon said under inspiration: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart do you good in the days of your young manhood, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the things seen by your eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this does not mean that the youth who follows every desire of his heart and eyes is not responsible for his actions to the Giver of life, Jehovah God. King Solomon continued: “But know that on account of all these the true God will bring you into judgment. So remove vexation from your heart, and ward off calamity from your flesh; for youth and the prime of life are vanity. Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”—Eccl. 11:9-12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah God will not shield anyone from disappointments, frustrations and injury if his heart’s desires greatly interfere with or limit activities directly associated with true worship. Therefore we are truly wise if we pursue desires that take into consideration our precious relationship with Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are a young man or a young woman, where is the desire of your heart? Is your chief concern your relationship with Jehovah? Is it your desire to use your abilities and material assets in such a way as to give you the most time possible for advancing Kingdom interests? Are you thinking seriously about enlarging your share in the vital work of Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking? Is it your heart’s desire to become a regular pioneer as soon as possible and, meanwhile, to make the best use of opportunities to share in the temporary pioneer service?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Why They Chose Pioneering</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Many dedicated, baptized young men and women are definitely concerned about using their energies to the full in the service of Jehovah God as devoted disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. One pioneer from Nigeria made this expression: “Even while I was in school I felt an awareness of the shortness of the time and I wanted to use the remaining time wisely. So I used to share regularly in the temporary pioneer service.” Another pioneer comments: “I believe the pioneer service is one way young ones like me can show Jehovah our gratitude for what he has done for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A young married man, on completing his training as a teacher in Bandung, Indonesia, returned to his native village. He returned with more than secular knowledge, for he had become a dedicated, baptized disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Alone in the mountain village, he spent, many hours proclaiming the “good news” to the people in their native language. He delivered the Memorial talk at 10 p.m., after the villagers had returned from their work. Over one hundred persons assembled outside in the marketplace before a campfire. Encouraged by the attendance and seeing the great need to increase the amount of time he was spending in preaching and teaching, he enrolled as a temporary pioneer. Soon he stopped secular teaching and became a regular pioneer. Now many of his former pupils are dedicated, baptized Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A circuit overseer from Japan observed that the brothers and sisters in that land regard pioneering as “the normal thing to do,” if there is a way to do it. Almost half the pioneers in Japan are young people. It is the usual thing for these, even if one of their parents is not in the truth, to prepare well ahead of time to pioneer when they graduate from high school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are in school, is your love for Jehovah and the people in your territory continuing to grow? Does this love reflect itself in a burning desire to do as much as you possibly can in the advancement of Kingdom interests? Do you make good use of your vacation periods by increasing your participation in the field ministry then? Are you preparing yourself for the regular pioneer service? Are you availing yourself of training that will make it easier for you to get a part-time job upon completing your secular education? Have you thought about a brother or a sister who might work with you as a pioneer partner? Have you discussed this with him or her? Do you share in the temporary pioneer service whenever the opportunity presents itself?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Pioneering While Going to School</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Some brothers and sisters have found that they can even be regular pioneers while going to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One youth serving as a pioneer in Hawaii relates: “I realized that pioneering a half day of each school day would serve as a protection from the influences of worldly schoolmates and also discourage extracurricular activities since I would be busy in the field ministry. With a lot of help from Jehovah and much encouragement from my family, I was able to do well in the pioneer work. I am really glad that I pioneered while going to school, because it really sharpened my appreciation for the precious privilege of serving Jehovah in the last days and helped me to rely more heavily on Jehovah as my Source of strength.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister in New York city who began pioneering while still in school had the following schedule: She would come home from school at about 2 p.m. Her day in service would start a half hour later and continue until about 6 or 7 o’clock. She did some of her homework during the lunch period and the rest of it after field service. She still enjoys pioneering and views it as a protection against being sidetracked by the things done in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister in Kansas was able to arrange to take most of her required number of subjects in the first three years of high school. This made it possible for her to pioneer during her senior year, when she was given permission to take only three classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Philippines, one sister, though compelled by her father to go to college, is still able to pioneer. How does she do it? “Every school opening,” she says, “I see to it that I enroll on the first week of registration so that I can choose a good schedule of time for school. From then on I am a student in the morning and a pioneer in the afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you are now attending school, can you make adjustments that would enable you to pioneer and yet not neglect your secular education? Is this the desire of your heart?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Rejecting College Education to Pioneer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Not all those who are pioneering now had that desire originally. There were those who wanted higher education in order to get ahead in the world. One pioneer sister serving in Hawaii comments: “My goal was to get a good college education. I entered college and became inactive spiritually. However, I found college very dissatisfying. I thought there must be something better in life, something to make life more rewarding. I began to attend meetings again and associated with pioneers. Soon I left college and pursued the desire to serve Jehovah as a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another Hawaiian sister relates the following: “My father wanted me to attend college on a scholarship. I had the desire to learn enough to see if human philosophies could help people with their problems. After one year of college, I realized the vanity of worldly wisdom and discontinued my college scholarship. My mother was a fine example as a pioneer. There were other zealous pioneers in the congregation, and their faith and zeal were contagious, stimulating a desire in me to join them in the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“After one circuit overseer’s visit, I was determined to become a pioneer. I talked to my mother about this and, due to my father’s not being in the truth, felt that I would have to leave’ home to pioneer. I explained to mother that, even if it meant leaving home to pioneer, I would do so. The thought of our becoming separated caused both of us to cry. I prayed that Jehovah would soften my father’s heart so that he would let me pioneer and remain at home. Jehovah answered my prayer and I have enjoyed a number of years at home in the pioneer service. Part-time work has been available to support myself.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Willingness to Give Up Seeming</span><br><br><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Material Advantages</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">When the desire to pioneer is strong enough, one is willing to give up seeming material advantages. Often even young people who enter the pioneer service have had to make adjustments. Those who have done so have been greatly blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One brother in Ubiri, Nigeria, who chose pioneering, although his unbelieving parents were arranging for him to get a university education, writes: “Since I have just finished my course in high school and am only qualified for clerical work—not having learned a trade—I just forced myself to become a fisherman. Though I have no one to support me financially, I will not give away this opportunity to pioneer, because I have been crying for it.” He is now conducting fifteen Bible studies in his regular pioneer assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister from Portugal relates her experience: “I was the only child and therefore the center of attention. But I realized that most of my time was being spent at my secular job. My parents did not depend on me financially. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that the time spent at my secretarial job could be much better used in the pioneer service. No sooner had I made my decision to be a pioneer than problems arose. I received a tempting offer as a secretary for another firm at double the salary I was then earning. When my father, who is not in the truth, learned of my decision to be a pioneer, he said he would never talk to me again and even threatened to take his life. But I stuck to my decision. Immediately my father ordered me out of the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“During those trying times my mother constantly encouraged me. Also, I will never be able to forget how my loving brothers and sisters so kindly filled that vacuum of love I needed. I will always be grateful to them. The offers for meals were more than the number of meals in a day. The brothers wanted me to keep healthy and even put on some weight so that my father would not think that I was suffering. When I went to Jehovah in prayer, I especially felt the strength and courage to continue in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">pioneer service. Then one day, nine months later, I met my father on the street. He found it hard to say ‘hello,’ but I felt he was glad to see me. To my surprise, shortly afterward I received word to come back and live at home and carry on my pioneer service. After my spending more than five years as a pioneer, my father has decided to go to his first convention. I can fully agree with the words recorded at Psalm 27:10: Tn case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A young married couple in the Philippines tell about their entering the pioneer service: “Our appreciation of the urgency of the times led us to leave bur full-time secular work and take up the pioneer service. Because of doing this, we now enjoy peace of mind and a much closer relationship as husband and wife because of working together in the field ministry. We have learned how to budget both our time and money. When working in the territory we try to plan our activity so that we can do both our house-to-house work and return visits in the same area. This cuts down on transportation expenses. In our home we have learned to buy the necessary food items first and in bulk when advisable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon finishing high school, a young sister in Nigeria began thinking seriously about pioneering. She had several opportunities for employment. Although it meant lower wages, she decided to take the job that allowed for more time to spend in preaching. She reasoned, ‘When this system passes away with its institutions, I will be sure of having a vocation.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A pioneer sister from Davao City, Philippines, speaks of the blessings that came when she gave up her secular job to pioneer: “I did not find real happiness in my secular job, as I had much discontentment and many frustrations. When I submitted my resignation, the company offered me a higher position with a big increase in salary. However, I was firm in my desire to be a pioneer. After two years of pioneering I have reaped nothing but a bundle of profound happiness and blessing. My Bible knowledge has greatly improved and my preaching work is more effective. I have also found it easier to manifest the fruitage of God’s spirit. Now I always make it a point to encourage other young persons like myself to share in the pioneer work.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The Encouragement of Parents Helps</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">The example of others can certainly be a source of encouragement. But, in addition thereto, at times the heart’s desire for what is good needs to be strengthened. Parents can do much to aid their children in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister from the Visayan Islands stated: “My parents did a lot to help me in my determination to be a pioneer. I took advantage of school vacation by applying to serve as a temporary pioneer. Also the experiences of our brothers as related in </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> stirred my heart to aspire to the privilege of pioneer work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An elder in Korea encouraged his four children to pioneer. At a circuit assembly he and the children were interviewed. The oldest daughter related how she had been the highest scholastically in her high school. She herself wanted to go to college at one point. However, her father informed her that, while she was free to choose such a course, she could not expect financial support from him. She changed her mind about college, and now she is enjoying many blessings as a pioneer. The next oldest, a son, told how he also at one time wanted to go to college and follow a worldly course. But his father sat down and reviewed the Scriptures with him. His father also told him that, if he insisted on following a worldly course, he would also have to find another place to live. He heeded his father’s counsel and is very grateful that his father was kind but firm in his stand. The two younger children explained that they were impressed by what happened to the two older ones. From the beginning they planned to become pioneers. The youngest son gave up his high school education to pioneer.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Consider Pioneering</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">While it may be your heart’s desire to share the joys of pioneering, your present circumstances simply may not allow you to do so. In that case do not feel discouraged. You can rest assured that Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ very much appreciate your faithful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be that, with persistent prayer, the obstacles standing in the way will eventually be removed, freeing you to fulfill the desire of your heart. This was the experience of one sister who is now serving as a missionary. When she made known her plans to pioneer, she was still a minor and living at home. Her unbelieving father did not want her to pioneer but wanted her to go to college. She constantly prayed to Jehovah to soften her father’s heart. Within a year, she was able to enter the pioneer service. Her health also began to improve and this made a favorable impression on her father. Looking back on her pioneer service, this sister says: “It was worth overcoming all the difficulties that have come along the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you ponder the experiences of others, consider whether you can seize the privilege of being a pioneer. Jehovah God, of course, has left it up to each one of us to decide just how much time we will devote to the work of Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking. He has also made clear to us the need for this vital work. He has revealed to us that this system of things will soon come to its end. This means that people’s lives are in grave danger. They need to come into an approved relationship with Jehovah if they are going to survive the “great tribulation.” Then, too, Jehovah has revealed that it is his will for us to spread the lifesaving message of his Word. Our conforming to his will is therefore an expression of our love for him and for fellow humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is your love for Jehovah motivating the desires of your heart? If it is, whether you are able to pioneer or not, you can have the deep satisfaction of knowing that you are whole-souled in your service to Jehovah. Jesus told his brothers to preach and to teach. “Make disciples,” he said. All dedicated Christians know what to do and they will keep busy telling the good news to others from house to house, everywhere, anytime.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Divine Victory&quot; International Assembly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> All of us are looking forward with eager anticipation to the good things to be enjoyed at the international assemblies. If any have not yet done so, now is the time to make definite plans to be in attendance. And do we not want those with whom we are studying to enjoy the rich spiritual food along with us? &lt;&nbsp;’ertainly! So include them in your plans. To aid you, here are a few suggestions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Many of you will be needing rooming accommodations. No arrangements will be made by the Society for camper, tent or trailer sites in the I'nited States. If you plan on camping, please work this out personally, using commercial facilities. As to hotel and motel accommodations, prices have been-increasing; so, few rooms will be available at the lowest prices listed. However, real effort will be put forth to get good accommodations at reasonable prices in private homes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Be sure to send in your room request form six or seven weeks before the start of the convention you plan to attend. Mail it, not to the Society, but to the address shown on the form for that city. Wherever possible, rooming assignments will be mailed directly to you. If you do not receive an assignment before you leave home, you may obtain it at the rooming department in the convention city. In case you have to cancel an accommodation, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">please be sure to notify both the landlord and the, rooming department.</span><span class="font14"> This will enable the rooming department to assign the rooms to someone else, and it shows consideration for the one who offered to provide the rooms.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> There is need for caution in large cities. Be sure to lock your car. Never leave anything showing in it, but keep any necessary items locked in the trunk. Also beware of pickpockets. They often mingle among large crowds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In view of the new session times this year, you may wonder what meals will be served at the assemblies. Arrangements will be made for breakfast and/or suitable refreshments prior to the morning sessions. There will be a noon meal and refreshments during the intermission. Also at the conclusion of the afternoon session food will be available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Pioneers should be sure to bring their meal tickets, earing for these as if they were money, as replacements are not available. They will also be needed to obtain literature in the bookroom at. pioneer rates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> One way to advertise the assembly is by wearing badges. If your congregation does not already have a supply of lapel cards and holders, these should he ordered immediately. The celluloid holders are 5c each and the lapel cards are lc each.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Another fine way to advertise the assembly is by sharing in the field service. True, no organized field service is scheduled for the days of the assembly. But handbills, magazines and literature will be available. Why not plan to spend some time while in the assembly city, either in the morning or in the evening, distributing handbills? No territory needs to be obtained. Also informal witnessing can be done on your way to the sessions in the morning or when returning to your accommodations in the early evening. Take advantage of every opportunity to speak about the good news and invite everyone possible to attend the assembly, especially those in whose home you may be staying. Even deaf-mutes can benefit, as there will be a deaf-mute section at all English-language assemblies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Any who do accept our invitation to attend the assembly ought to be able to see by our conduct that we truly reflect unselfish love and concern for others. This should be evident in our interest in helping others to get seated, and in our not saving seats needlessly. Of course, there is no objection to saving seats for those who have left temporarily or for volunteer workers who will soon return. But otherwise, would it not be the unselfish thing to leave seats open for anyone to use when we are not sitting on them? And even if a younger person is seated, how fine it is to offer it freely to an elderly or infirm person who may not have found a place to sit and listen. By such loving concern for others we honor our God, .Jehovah, who has taught us what love really is.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> Then, too, volunteer service provides an excellent opportunity for us to minister to the needs of others as Jesus did. Such ministering, motivated by love, can contribute to our happiness. (Acts 20: 35; Ps. 110:3) Why not plan to volunteer as individuals or as family groups? Brothers having families could perhaps volunteer to serve as attendants in sections where they will be sitting with their families.' If you cannot serve all five days, your doing so for any other period of time will be very much appreciated. Volunteer service applications should </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, eol. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">♦ All serving as regular pioneers as of February 1, 1973, will obtain from their presiding overseer their pioneer meal ticket for use at the international assembly.

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">In Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Ilas the business territory of your congregation been worked recently? Many businessmen and women are seldom contacted at their homes but can be spokefi to at their places of employment. Ones who work business territory advise that early in the morning, shortly after establishments open, business is usually slow and that this is a fine time to work that territory. Too, early afternoon, for an hour or so following the lunch period, there is often a lull in activity. Two special pioneers who were encourag'ed by the Society to work business territory that had not been covered for some time wrote: “We made special effort to work the business territory. In just two mornings, using the suggestions from past </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> issues, namely, to call early in the day, to be very brief and to use a businesslike approach, we were able to place 105 books and six subscriptions. Many of the busi-“Divine Victory” Assembly </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font14">be signed by the presiding overseer and sent to the convention city (not to the Society). Please advise the volunteer service department of any change in your plans.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> To reap the bountiful spiritual benefits from the assemblies, we need to be in our seats when the sessions begin and make every effort to stay for the entire program, including the closing prayer. The changes in the session times should enable, everyone to do this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> How we conduct ourselves while attending assemblies is very important. Not only does it make things pleasant for others, but it can serve as a fine witness to outsiders. (1 Pet. 2:12) Certainly it is refreshing to see and be with those who manifest love and consideration even when they are a little tired or must wait a few minutes to be served. Parents can aid by keeping their children with them at all times. In fact, all of us may find it helpful to review the article “Showing Love for One Another at Assemblies,” in the June 15, 1970, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> As all of us strive to reflect the fruitage of God’s spirit, we will enjoy many blessings at the “Divine Victory” Assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">nessmen were sincerely pleased to have us take the time to stop and speak with them. We much appreciate your encouragement to call on the stores in our community.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In New York city experienced publishers and pioneers are now working the Wall Street area, including every office building, large and small. Not only has a great deal of literature been placed with businessmen, including executives, but also many fine discussions have resulted. Arrangements were made to care for interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Businessmen and women are included among the “all sorts of men” whom Jehovah wishes to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth” and “be saved.” (1 Tim. 2:4) It is suggested that the field overseer of each congregation work out arrangements for the congregation’s business territory to be covered. Ones who share in this work, doing so with full reliance on Jehovah, can be confident of his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Serving with Sense of Urgency! </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Of course, we appreciate that literature distribution is just one part of our preaching work. There is a real need to follow through on interested persons with return visits and home Bible studies. Many have found that temporary pioneering has aided them to have a fuller share in this. A brother serving in the South commented : ‘As a temporary pioneer last month I started six Bible studies, and thus far this month four more.’ Asked if he was doing anything extraordinary to start studies, he replied: ‘No, I just let people know that the purpose of our ministry is to study the Bible with them.’ He located so many interested persons as a temporary pioneer that he took up the regular pioneer service to care for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> While we may not be able to be regular pioneers, can we individually share more fully in Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making? Feeling the urgency of the times as we do, we will want to do all that our circumstances reasonably permit in working alongside the ‘king’s secretary,’ Jehovah’s anointed ones, in marking the foreheads of honest-hearted ones. (Ezek. 9:4) As we do so, Jehovah will bless us richly.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">• When a person is given either a private or a public reproof for unchristian conduct, are terms or requirements then imposed that the individual must comply with?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No, neither one privately reproved by the judicial committee nor one publicly reproved is given certain terms to comply with (as if he were on a form of “probation”). It is simply required that he conduct himself in harmony with Bible principles, as the others in the congregation do. The judicial committee may strongly recommend that the individual discontinue certain habits or associations that could lead to a repetition of the wrongdoing and, in accord with the individual’s needs, will give spiritual assistance and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. When there has been serious wrongdoing, even though the reproof is not announced, any weight of responsibility in the way of special assig-nments in the congregation would be removed from the individual, (“or,” p. 167) When one is publicly reproved, the congregation would be advised as to what privileges have been removed, (“or,” p. 169) When the individual gives evidence of regaining his spiritual strength and stability, privileges can be gradually restored. The same applies when a disfellowshiped person is reinstated, (“or,” p. 177)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If one who, for serious wrongdoing, was given either a private or a public reproof moves to another congregation before privileges have been fully restored to him, the judicial committee of the congregation to which he moves will determine when the gradual restoration of privileges may fittingly be made, (“or,” pp. 169, 170) Any further serious violation of God’s Word, of course, would be handled by the judicial committee where the individual now associates.</span></p>

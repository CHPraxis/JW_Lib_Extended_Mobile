<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SEPTEMBER 1973 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“But we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.”—MIc. 4:5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">VOL. XVI NO. 9</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">What pleasure we at Bethel felt recently on hearing the final figures for the “Divine Victory” assemblies in North America! In the continental United States, a grand total of 665,945 attended the nineteen assemblies and 15,851 were baptized. And at the five Canadian assemblies, 155,788 attended and 3,838 were immersed. It was a marvelous spiritual feast! Having benefited from it, we should all feel strengthened and invigorated for a full share in the work that lies ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What have you done with the new books that you received? We were encouraged to read and discuss with our families the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—From What Source?</span><span class="font12"> Many of us have been doing just that. If you have, you know why the suggestion was given. What is in that book is information that we need in our field ministry now, and if we are acquainted with it we can make the best use of it. Also, the counsel it contains affects our own lives and will aid us greatly in our efforts to put on the new personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No doubt many of you are also reading the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached. </span><span class="font12">What a wealth of spiritual meat it contains! It will he a pleasure to get an overall view of it in public talks later this year, and then we will begin using it at our congregation book studies early in December. We certainly have good things ahead of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If your order was sent in early, then by the time you get this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> you will no doubt have received a shipment of the new books. Feel free to start using them in your field ministry. Although they are not the regular offer yet, we encourage you to carry copies with you and to offer them when you meet someone that you feel would benefit from them. Some people may ask what you have that is new. Bible students and others on whom you make return visits will</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Intensive Tract Distribution </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">130,000,000 copies being readied for use</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Early in June, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">stimulated our anticipation for the forthcoming assemblies by telling us that instructions would be given there concerning “a special work” in which all of us would be privileged to share. Before the first day of the assembly had ended we knew what it was—intensive distribution of a special tract on an unprecedented scale. One hundred and thirty million copies are being supplied by the Society for use world wide. Forty-five million have been shipped out for use here in the United States alone. About a hundred of these are for you personally to use in your ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This is just what we need to reach many honest-hearted ones in the final portion of the “last days.” Compared with the world’s population, we are ‘few workers.’ The field is huge; “the harvest is great.” (Matt. 9:37) Often many of us have wondered how we might get to people who have received only a limited witness. Even in territories that are worked often, many still do not really know the purpose of our calling because they have not taken time to listen. How grateful we can be to Jehovah for making available an instrument that will enable us to reach people quickly with a vital message from his Word ! doubtless appreciate it if you make copies available to them, t,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Before us now, in the latter part of September, is the special work with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 16. Our brothers and sisters everywhere are organizing for this activity. We are anxious to get started. May Jehovah bless you as you share whole-souled in delivering this timely message, and thus prove that you are indeed for Divine Bulership—with its Chief Agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Right on the front of the tract an urgent question is posed: “Is Time Running Out for Mankind?” It is a question that people everywhere need to face. The answer is set out in a style that is designed to catch the attention even of people who are inclined to be indifferent. Anyone who picks up the tract will quickly have impressed on his mind the main ideas, which are set out in bold, eye-catching style. The large type and brevity of the message invite reading. Here in concise form is a forceful presentation of an urgent message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">TEN-DAY DISTRIBUTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The distribution is scheduled to be accomplished in just ten days, from September 21 through 30. Apart from your use of the packet that you received at the assembly, it is requested that none of the tracts be distributed before September 21. And by the time that you complete your field service on September 30, it is hoped that every last one will be in the hands of the public. Why is the distribution being done in such an intensive manner? Because of the impact that this will have on the public. People talk to one another, and they will soon realize that nearly everyone they know was served with the same urgent message. This will make a far deeper impression than would a gradual distribution over many months. Furthermore, we realize that the time remaining for this wicked world is greatly reduced. Opportunity for people to learn the truth and take their stand on Jehovah’s side is fast running out. Because of our deep love and concern for people, we want to give them every possible opportunity, and at the same time accomplish a grand witness that brings honor to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">There are many persons newly associated with the congregation; this discussion should build up their appreciation for how the organization functions. The following questions may be used as a basis for discussion, with the audience answering; use scriptures as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1) W<sup>T</sup>hat position does Jehovah occupy in relation to his organization? (Rev. 4:9-11) (2) What evidence is there that the heavenly angelic organization of Jehovah actually takes an interest in us here on earth?

Remind publishers that goal is to complete tract distribution by Sunday night. Request any who have more tracts than they can use to turn them in so that others can distribute them. Mention that early in October we will go right back into the same territory with the special “Awake!” Song 90.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 30 </span><span class="font10">15 min: Song 95. Introduction, text and comments. Also “Question Box.” 15 min: Discuss the obtaining of “Awake!” subscriptions. Ask publishers how many have personal subscriptions for “Watchtower,” how many for “Awake!” What advantage? Why do we distribute “Awake!” and what purpose does it serve in our ministry? How is that purpose served especially well if people subscribe?

<p><span class="font10">15 min: Concluding comments. Include remarks on the article &quot;Resist the 'Tendency to Envy,’ ” in the August 15, 1973, &quot;Watchtower.” Encourage all to prepare well for discussion next week on “The Issue.” Song 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Song 101. Introduction, text and comments. (Might have several school-age publishers discussing text together in school cafeteria and applying it to their lives.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Use of Special Magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Comment on points from the fourth paragraph of the article “Using the Special Magazines.” Demonstrate how to offer the October 22 issue to a schoolteacher who previously obtained the &quot;Evolution” book. (Teacher says he enjoyed book; so, when offering &quot;Awake!”, student says he can have it for a full year for $1.50.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstrate house-to-house magazine offer, featuring the October 15 “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">30 min: How Clear!}' Do We See the Issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the outset briefly set forth what the issue of universal sovereignty is: In attacking God’s law, Satan called into question the rightfulness, righteousness and deservedness of God’s sovereignty. And the rebellion of Satan and the first humans raised yet another question: Would all other intelligent creatures ignore God’s law if that seemed to be to their advantage? When we see this issue clearly, we recognize disregard of God’s law as rebellion against him as Ruler. By rebelling against him a person sides with Satan. Does appreciation of these facts influence our daily conduct?—“True Peace and Security,” pp. 52, 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discuss the following questions with the audience, making sure that in each instance it is shown how the issue of sovereignty is involved and that what one does shows where he stands in relation to that issue. Encourage publishers to comment freely; read scriptures and bring in fine points from “True Peace and Security” book as time permits. (1) When would a husband’s actions toward his wife and family reveal that he needed to let recognition of the issue be a greater force in his life? (Eph. 5:28-31; 6:4; Col. 3:19, 21; tp p. 168 fl5; p. 175 H22; p. 139 1117) (2) How does a wife, even if her husband may be unreasonable or demanding, prove that she sees the issue clearly? (Eph. 5:22-24; 1 Pet. 3:1-6; tp pp. 140, 141; p. 176 F24) (3) What attitude and actions on the part of children toward their parents ■would show that they do appreciate the issue? Why? (Col. 3:17, 20; Rom. 15:2, 3; tp pp. 132, 133, 140, 141) (4) Since disregard for traffic laws (speed limits, parking, etc.) has become “acceptable” in the world, why would our seeing the issue clearly prevent us from imitating the world in this respect? (Eph. 2:2, 3; 1 John 5:19; tp p. 137 1?14) (5) Why w’ould one’s littering and sharing in other similar acts reveal the need to consider more seriously one’s attitude toward the issue? (Matt. 7:12; tp p. 169 US) (6) How can real appreciation for the issue prevent one from being influenced by racial, social or national prejudice? (Acts 17:26; Rom. 3:23; Jas. 2:1-9; tp p. 171 fll2 to p. 172 fl6) (7) What aspects about the settlement of the issue make it urgent that we zealously share in Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making? (Matt. 24:34; 2 Thess. 1:6-9; 2 Pet. 3:9, 15; tp pp. 173-175) In concluding, reemphasize the importance of seriously reflecting on our conduct and activity. Are we working hard to make advancement in living in ever fuller recognition of Jehovah’s sovereignty?—tp p. 143 1T25; p. 144 U26.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Our Early Harvest from the Book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">In ancient Israel harvesttime was a period of great rejoicing. That happiness spread over some months, as there was an early harvest of flax, barley and wheat, followed by the later harvest of grapes, dates, figs and olives. We might use that to illustrate two provisions for rejoicing in connection with our new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God's Kingdom of a Thousand, Years Has Approached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As announced at the recent assemblies, during the first week in I Jecember we will begin to study the book in the congregation book studies. But even before we begin in that way to reap the fine spiritual things from the new book, we will be able to gain much from it. This is because an early harvest, as it were, is being arranged. We will soon be moving quickly through the entire book in a series of seven public talks during November and December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You will benefit greatly from these seven talks. Maybe you just do not foresee being able to sit down and study the entire book during the next few months. So what better way could you find to get the overall picture than to move rapidly through it during these talks? And won’t that “bird’s-eye view,” as it were, lay a fine groundwork for your detailed consideration of it at the book study starting in December? This will make the book study more meaningful for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another benefit you will get from these seven talks involves your field service. We will be placing the new book in the house-to-house work during November. Can’t you see, then, how even the first few of these talks are going to help you to be more confident and enthusiastic about offering the book? You will know some of the subjects it considers and will appreciate how important it is for persons to have this information. You will even be able to mention specific parables and Bible chapters that the book treats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Though you may not be assigned to deliver the discourses, there is something you can do in advance that will aid you to gain the most benefit from this “early harvest,” the seven talks. Each one of them will discuss a specific portion of the Bible, maybe a certain parable or chapter. Why not plan to read this over during the week before the talk, perhaps as your own personal Bible reading or together with the family? Then the talk dealing with that portion will be ever so much more valuable to you. Some may even be able to read the chapters in the new book that will be covered in the talk. Do so if you can. The Bible portions and chapters of the book to be covered are listed with each of the following outlines. Each week the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">chairman</span><span class="font12"> should announce what will be covered the following week. Bring your copy of the book to the talks, so you can follow along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Speakers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You will note from the following outlines that each of the talks covers quite a bit of material, from two to four chapters of the new book. Do not attempt to include in your discourse all of the points in the chapter assigned to you. Of course, it will be beneficial to read through the chapters to get the overall view. But the outline calls attention to key sections, and in your talk you are to concentrate on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">KINGDOM MINISTRY, SEPTEMBER 1973 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the audience has been alerted to read in advance a certain portion of the Bible, be sure to work with that portion in your talk. Help the brothers to understand it and to be in position to explain the essential meaning of that portion. You can read, or have read, what seems advisable in that Bible portion. Also, there is no objection, to calling attention to, oi' even reading from the new book, certain choice parts of the chapters you have been assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You will find with each outline a theme and some indications as to the direction the talk should take. Bear these in mind in preparing the talk, as they will help to make your talk distinct. Some talks cover material dealing basically with anointed Christians. In accord with the suggestions given, help the audience to see how ones with an earthly hope are involved in the matter, how they can apply the principles in their dealings or how this should affect their outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Elders, we recommend that the talks be given during November and December, if possible. In some instances other talks may already have been lined up for those months. But would it be possible to readjust previously arranged talks so that these seven can be given in those two months, thus accomplishing the greatest possible good? If your congregation has the visit of the circuit overseer, or has a circuit assembly, during November or December, then these seven talks should be fitted around such events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Naturally, it is best if elders in the local congregation or in nearby congregations deliver these talks. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font12"> pp. (56, 95 ; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 6/73 p. 4.) Last year in -arranging for talks of this nature based on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise— Theocracy</span><span class="font12"> book many congregations were able to exchange speakers, and that can be done again. For example, the talks might be divided up between two or three congregations. The brother who prepares the first talk would deliver it in congregation A, the next week in congregation B, and finally in congregation C. He would be followed a week later in each congregation by the brother who prepares the second talk in the series. And so on in the proper sequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The elders in the congregation can work out the arrangements for these talks when they meet during September. When details have been settled, handbills may be ordered; the sooner the better.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1.</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> A Thousand Years of Peace Has Approached </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(ka</span><span class="font12"> chapters 1-4; read Revelation 19 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">:11-20</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">: 6.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Look to God’s, not men’s, promise of thousand-year ruler.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 1; 10 min.) Promises of lasting, peaceful rule for mankind so common that few believe them any longer; Christians may be able to cite texts about coming peaceful rule, but why believe such? What is basis for believing? Will consider matter today. No human ruler or government has proved permanent, able to bring lasting peace. Hitler boasted he would, but failed. (Pars. 1-5) Should look to God, as his will is irresistibly done. (Pars. 6, 7, 11; Dan. 4:34-37) He foretells thousand-year rulership, mentioning it six times in Revelation 19:11 through 20:10. Evidence that Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 C.E. and that seventh millennium of human history will soon begin shows why we have reason to believe millennial rule has approached. (Pars. 11-14, 17, 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God will prepare the way for peaceful rule by ridding earth of peace disturbers.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 2; 10 min.) Human efforts to secure peace by treaties, pacts and negotiations have repeatedly failed. God foretells his way of providing peace on earth—eliminating peace disturbers from earth. Bible depicts enthroned Son as one leading war to accomplish this. (Rev. 19:11-16; pars. 1-3) Is a war from God, not between nations; those destroyed have no burial with honors. (Rev. 19:17, 18; par. 5) Will even eliminate world system of political rule. (Rev. 19:19-21; pars. 14, 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">lid,000 qualified, rulers will help mankind from heaven.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 3; 15 min.) God assures us that there will be survivors on earth and in heaven; we can be among them and enjoy resulting peace. How? Revelation shows peace disturbers in heaven will also be removed. (Rev. 20:1-3) Will not be around to mislead people—this suggests some will survive. Earlier, Revelation 7:9-15 had indicated that great crowd would survive tribulation. (Par. 4) Who will rule mankind? God provides rulers in heaven. (Rev. 20: 4-6; pars. 8, 11) In contrast to humans who will progress gradually to perfection and life, these are resurrected immortal. (Pars. 16-19) This resurrection is first in time and importance. (Par. 33) Would you like to have such rulers? The more we know about them, the more we want them as rulers. (Par. 42)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">God’s rulers have proved to be promoters of real peace.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 4; 20 min.) God has selected rulers who are and will be lovers of God and of peace. (Par. 4) They are not like human rulers who tend to divide up mankind, retarding peace. (Par. 6) Mankind will be united under their rule, even have one language. (Par. 8; read pars. 11, 12.) Easy to see how this would contribute to peace. Are we already striving for international unity as Christians? (Par. 15) Anointed Christians who will be heavenly rulers promote peace in their preaching. (Isa. 2:4; par. 17) They follow pattern of Jesus, Prince of Peace. (Isa. 9: 6, 7; pars. 21, 43) He avoided human politics, stressed heavenly kingdom. (Pars. 47, 49) Can display your real desire to live during approaching thousand-year peace, by sharing in peaceful work he commanded. (Pars. 51-54) One thus aligns self with peacepromoting rulers, and manifests one’s confidence that this thousand-year peace has approached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus and his associate kings serve to the benefit of those who accept heaven’s rulership.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 5; 15 min.) Most persons were born into a nation; never had to decide to accept this rulership. Many are apathetic or critical of government because of obvious deficiencies; rulers may be greedy or dishonest. Divine provision for government is vastly different. But do we take it for granted or do we show real interest in it? Are we eager to learn about it? God’s king, Jesus, unselfishly gave life for those who accept heaven’s rulership; do we? (Pars. 1-3) Even David will have to acknowledge Jesus’ position; will we? (Par. 6) Christ will have associate kings ruling </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font12"> him. (Rev. 20:4: pars 8, 10) They pattern selves after his image, so will be loving, righteous, worthy of our re-' spect. (1 Pet. 4:1; par. 12) This ensures harmonious government, no rivalry. (Pars. 15, 16) While on earth they, as ambassadors, strive to reconcile individuals to God. (2 Cor. 5 :18-6:1; pars. 19, 21, 23) As ambassadors loyal to God, on earth they are not identified with or supporters of human political arrangements. (Pars. 24-27) Will be able to benefit mankind during rulership of thousand years. (Par. 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Rulership from heaveft-^—if ice accept it—also performs priestly services in our behalf.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 6, pp. 83-93; 20 min.) These associate rulers will also be priests with Christ. (Rev. 20:6) You may have had bad experience with corrupt priests. Priests often have deceived, misled people. (Relate Acts 14: 8-19; pars. 2, 5-7.) We cannot imagine Jesus’ associate rulers, with their fine qualities, being like that. Of what value is a priest? (Heb. 5:1-3) Because of man’s sinfulness, we need service of perfect priest. God made Jesus a righteous and perpetual priest. (Heb. 5: 4-6; pars. 15, 18, 19) Is far superior even to priesthood of Aaron’s family. (Heb. 7:15, 16, 23-8:1; pars. 20, 24) Do we appreciate that, realizing what a blessing rulership from heaven thus provides for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Priestly service in our behalf carries right into very presence of God.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 6; pp. 93-116; 20 min.) Aaron and associate priests served in typical sanctuary. (Describe, using illustration on p. 93.) Was typical of heavenly things. (Heb. 8:4, 5; 9:9, 11) When Jesus was baptized, becoming High Priest, area of God’s presence came to be Most Holy of True Temple, (l’ars. 30, 39, 40) As spiritual Son on earth, Jesus was in Holy of spiritual temple, able to enjoy spiritual light and food. (Pars. 45-48) Anointed ones, like Aaron’s sons, are priests. (Rev. 1:5, 6; pars. 52, 61, 62) Because of being spirit-begotten, are in Holy and can enjoy spiritual enlightenment and food. (Par. 64) Epon death they pass beyond curtain-like barrier of flesh and enter very presence of God. (Heb. 10:19-22) As with Christ, from heaven they will be sympathetic, understanding priests. (Pars. 73-76, 81) Surely is desirable rulership. You are not forced to submit to it; up to you if want to accept it.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Millennium is loving provision to help us qualify for eternal life.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 7; 25 min.) If someone spends time, effort helping us to qualify for job or other desirable thing, natural to respond with appreciation. Associated with millennium are provisions to help us to qualify to live forever. Millennium may also be referred to as Judgment Day, thousand-year period of judging. Follows end of wicked system. (Rev. 20:4; pars. 3, 4) Jehovah has committed judging to Jesus; anointed ones share with him. Not something for Christian to fear, for judging will be in righteousness. (Acts 17:31) Even “unrighteous” can benefit. (Pars. 10, 11) Resurrected ones still not perfect, so thousandyear judgment day provides for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">deliverance</span><span class="font12"> from sin for those who want to serve God. (Pars. 12, 13, 20, 21) “Righteous” ones resurrected have advantage of already having displayed integrity, love for God. Will “unrighteous” put away bad habits? Provision of millennium allows for that. (Pars. 25, 26)' Will give </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> first real “chance” at eternal life; heavenly judges will help. (Par. 32) God will provide instruction to help us. (Rev. 20:11-15; pars. 34, 35) Earthly “princes” will also aid. (Ps. 45:15, 16) Jesus’ faithful ancestors and other men of integrity will thus serve. (Pars. 38, 43-46)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Transforming personalities with eternity in view. </span><span class="font12">((’hap. 8; 15 min.) More is needed than righteous administrative arrangements; we need to be right kind of persons. To find permanent place in New Order, we must learn righteousness. (Isa. 26:9; par. 1) Chief Judge, Jesus, will lead in executing just decisions. (Isa. 11:1-5; pars. 4, 5) This will aid humans to transform their personalities, abandoning beastly qualities and characteristics. (Isa. 11: 6-9; pars. 9, 10) Can expect corresponding literal fulfillment in the animals coming to be at peace with one another and with humans. (Pars. 13, 14) Do you have jealousy, wrath, envies, prejudices?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The post-millennium test as to who qualify for life. </span><span class="font12">(Chap. 9; 15 min.) Question remains, Will we meet Jehovah’s standard for eternal life? At end of millennium, Jesus will turn things back to Father. (1 Cor. 15:24-28; pars. 3, 4) God will permit Satan one final opportunity to test mankind’s support of Jehovah’s sovereignty. (Rev. 20: 7-10; pars. 5-7) Some will rebel, choosing group sovereignty. (Pars. 11-14) “Nations” that attack representatives of New Jerusalem will be like Gog of Magog who led attack on Christians during great tribulation. (Pars. 15-17) Satan, demons and rebels will be cast into second death, second type of death that entered realm of creation. (Rev. 20:10, 14, 15; pars. 25-28) Surviving mankind will then be acknowledged as worthy of eternal life, coming to life. (Rev. 20:5; pars. 31-33) Then all mankind will joyfully praise God. (Ps. 150:1-6) Jehovah’s witnesses invite individuals to do that with them now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">4.</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Are You Wise or Foolish Regarding Christ’s Presence? </span><span class="font12">(fra chapters 10-13; read Matthew 25:1-30.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">An aspect of Jesus’ “sign” that should move us to be alert, discreet,</span><span class="font12"> (('hap. 10; 15 min.) One of most frequent subjects of our preaching is “sign” of Matthew 24. Often refer to features of it to establish we are in “last days.” But Jesus’ “sign” covered Matthew 25 also; parables there, in addition to being part of sign, have vital meaning for us. (Read Matthew 25:1-13.) Reply was to question about, time of his “presence.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Parousia</span><span class="font12"> meant, not his first coming, but future presence. (Matt. 24:3; pars. 8-14) Fulfillment of parable was an evidence of presence. Bible likens Jesus to bridegroom; anointed ones are compared to chaste virgins. (John 3 : 28-30; Eph. 5: 23-27; pars. 18, 21-23) From the start, Christians were obliged to maintain selves as virgins awaiting marriage in heaven. (Pars. 26-28) Would be identified by “oil” or being filled with God’s enlightening Word and spirit. (Matt. 5:16; pars. 31, 36-38) Bridegroom was to be ‘delayed,’ with antichrist coming first. (1 John 2:18; pars. 42-46) Danger exists of being asleep, not alert to Christ’s presence. (Matt. 25:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Parable’s fulfillment in our day should affect us. </span><span class="font12">(Chap. 11; 15 min.) ('an rightly expect, after period of sleep, an awakening associated with bridegroom’s presence. (Matt. 25:5, 6) C. T. Russell correctly pointed forward to end of Gentile Times for 1914. (Pars. 4, 5) Ue recognized </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font12"> applied to invisible presence. Though he miscalculated beginning of Christ’s presence, in time his associates recognized presence began in 1914 C.E. (Pars. 6, 9, 10, 48, 55) From 1919 there was an awakening among anointed. (Pars. 11-19) Nominal Christians would not accept Jesus’ presence; “discreet” virgins parted company with such “foolish” ones. (Pars. 24-26) Foolish ones are in line for destruction. (Pars. 41, 42) Emphasizes our need to recognize the complete “sign” and to keep on the watch. (Pars. 44-46)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Christians need to work, resulting in growth—this is part of the “sign” too.</span><span class="font12"> (Chaps. 12, 13; 25 min.) Following parable in Matthew is also part of “sign.” (Gist of Matthew 25:14-30) It should help us see need to work hard for God. (fra p. 258, par. 3) Logical to expect Christ as king since 1914 to inspect and test servants. (Par. 1) In parable Jesus committed talents to disciples. (Pars. 4-10) Talents represented potentiality for reaping disciples. (Pars. 12-15) By preaching and teaching they did business. (Pars. 20, 24, 26, 30, 35) As part of sign, can expect to see culminating fulfillment since 1914. (Pars. 37-40) Would be an inspection to see if slaves showed increase by use of talents. (Par. 45) Evidence among Witnesses is that members of anointed slave have increased talents, resulting in now over 1$ million Christians! (Pars. 52-56) Settling accounts would span some time. (Chap. 13, par. 3) After start Qf </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font12"> has been time to reward anointed ones sleeping in death. (1 Cor. 15: 50-54; pars. 5-8) They are resurrected to reign with Christ, entering heavenly joy. (Par. 14) Sluggish slave deliberately did not increase master’s talents. (Pars. 19, 20) Finds counterpart in nominal Christians and those separating from God’s servants. (Pars. 21-24) In line for execution in darkness of great tribulation. (Par. 29) Anointed slave determined to continue its hard work, increasing talents. (Pars. 26, 32, 33) Is course of wisdom to join in its work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">5.</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Do You Qualify to Inherit God’s Kingdom? </span><span class="font12">(fra chapters 14, 15; read Matthew 25: 31-46.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By your attitude and acts, begin now to qualify to inherit (rod’s kingdom.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 14; 40 min.) Many today believe no one will live forever; others feel all will be saved. Both views lead to outlook that one’s attitudes and acts are not important. Bible proves otherwise; are especially crucial since 1914. Witnesses have often shown that fulfillment of “sign” of Christ’s presence proves Kingdom set up in heaven then. Parable of sheep and goats, a part of “sign,” proves attitudes and acts now can affect whether one qualifies for eternal life. (Read verses as you discuss them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Son of man is Jesus, now on heavenly throne. (Dan. 7:13, 14; pars. 5-7) In time will dash nations to pieces. (Ps. 2:7-9) People are first separated. (Pars. 13-15) Would take time for personalities and conduct to be manifest. (Pars. 16-18) Parable applies now, not during or after millennium—Christians will not then be thrown into prisons; now is time of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">parousia;</span><span class="font12"> and parable relates to persons alive when Jesus takes power, not to living and dead to be judged during millennium. (Par. 19; Rev. 20:11, 12) “Sheep” are Christians with hope of eternal life on earth. They are “great crowd” shepherded by Lamb. (Rev. 7:9, 10, 17; par. 32) Inherit Kingdom by being earthly subjects; God had this in mind since ransomable children born to Adam and Eve. (Pars. 35-37) “Sheep” qualify because, out of faith in Jesus, they help his spiritual brothers. (Heb. 2:16, 17; pars. 43-47) Joining selves to spiritual Jews, they dedicate lives to God and faithfully serve him. (Zech. 8: 20-23; pars. 48-53) They display humble attitude, pursue peace, keep separate from world, live by Bible standards, share in preaching. (Pars. 55, 56, 60) Ask self: How does Jesus judge my actions and attitudes? Is this “sign” meaningful to me? Do I show it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Not all will qualify—will you?</span><span class="font12"> (('hap. 15; 15 min.) Parable shows that some persons do not qualify but receive eternal death. Why? May not have persecuted Christ or his spiritual brothers; might be their negative attitude that puts them on Devil’s side. (Pars. 5-8) Is no basis for claim of ignorance as to whom anointed represent. (Pars. 11-13) Where do we fit in? How about our family and relatives? Of what course regarding them does this emphasize need? Is not a matter of no concern because of being long way off; “goats” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">soon</span><span class="font12"> to be destroyed at end of this system. (2 Thess. 1: 7-10; par. 14) Will not experience eternal torment—a form of everlasting life—but eternal cutting off or death. (Pars. 3, 4, 17, 18) Righteous “sheep” will be protected during war of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Should be source of encouragement. (Pars. 19, 21) To begin qualifying for eternal life, it is clear that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">positive</span><span class="font12"> action is needed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">6. The “Sign” that God’s New Order Is Near (fca </span><span class="font12">chapters 16, 17; read Matthew 23 : 34-24: 51.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">We can be uplifted by the “sign” that New Order is near!</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 16; 30 min.) Problems and worries of today leave most persons troubled, insecure about future. Vastly different with Christians who understand meaning of Jesus’ “sign” regarding our time. (Read appropriate verses in Matthew 24 as you discuss them.) Apostles were interested in future in view of Jesus’ comments. (Luke 19: 41-44; Heb. 9:26; pars. 3-7) When would end of Jewish system come? How would they know? Jesus outlined events leading up to destruction of Jerusalem. (Pars. 8-14) Was life-or-death matter to note the indication that destruction impended. (Pars. 15-17) When Romans encompassed Jerusalem, Christians knew end near. (Pars. 21, 22, 26) Larger future fulfillment expected, as Revelation chapter 6 (written after 70 C.E.) pointed forward to war, famine and pestilence. Applies to entire wicked system, dominated by Christendom. Have seen evidences of fulfillment of sign since 1914. (Pars. 28, 30-33) Though this means destruction impends, is cause of encouragement. Why? Note what will be destroyed. Led by Anglo-American Seventh World Power, nations look to UN for peace. Revelation shows that this peace organization will lead in desolating false religion. (Pars. 42-44) Those desiring God’s favor are urged to get out of false religion, just as Christians fled Jerusalem. (Par. 45) Coming destruction will begin with false religion and include rest of wicked system. (Pars. 52, 53) Encouragingly, some will survive. (Pars. 55-57) These will be ones discerning true Messiah and gathering there for spiritual nourishment. (Pars. 60, 63) They are not discouraged by disturbances in the physical heavens. (Pars. 70, 71) Will not be forced to acknowledge </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font12"> when Jesus comes to destroy system, for they already have acknowledged his presence and that he has gathered his anointed ones. (Pars. 74, 76) They are sure all he promised will occur, and look forward to preservation. (Pars. 81-83) Have we fully joined with such ones? Time to decide now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus stressed need to be alert and active, as with the “faithful and discreet slave.”</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 17; 25 min.) Hard to believe that persons would ignore fulfillment of “sign,” but they do. As with people before Flood, most display lack of faith and ignore </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">parousia.</span><span class="font12"> (Pars. 4-7) Need to keep on watch that we are alert and active when he comes as executioner. Ought to live each day as ones aware of the time. (Pars. 10-13) Lesson in being active and faithful during presence is found in “faithful and discreet slave.” Jesus directed words to entire body of disciples. (Pars. 14, 16) Slave class began with anointing of disciples in 33 C.E. when nation of spiritual Israel formed. (Pars. 20-23) Slave began to make spiritual food available. (Pars. 24-26) In modern times, anointed as a class have provided spiritual food. (Pars. 29, 30) Even despite difficult condition of World War I, slave class continued supplying food for individual domestics. (Par. 40) After “Master” received Kingdom power and turned attention to servants, he showed approval, assigning responsibility for his spiritual things on earth. Now even have ‘responsibility of caring for “great crowd.” (Pars. 49-51, 54) Individual anointed ones turning bad become like the “evil slave,” rejected by Jesus. (Pars. 59-62, 65) Even if not of the “faithful and discreet slave” class, should see need to be faithful in Christian activities. Attention to such will aid us to avoid being ensnared. (Luke 21:34-36; pars. 66-68) Thus sign that New Order is near will mean eternal blessings for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Heed the warning—Now is the time for decisive religious action!</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 18; 35 min.) Jehovah’s witnesses happy that many new ones regularly associate; shows commendable interest in true worship. How important is decisive action on your part? For Witnesses, how vital is it to reach still others (relatives, workmates, neighbors) with Christian message? First and Second Thessalonians give an answer; will discuss “man of lawlessness.” General outlook today is hope for peace among nations; Bible shows that time will come. (1 Thess. 5:1-3; pars. 1-3) Some in Thes-salonica thought Christ’s presence and “day of Jehovah” had come; Paul corrected them, explaining fulfillment was future. (2 Thess. 2:1, 2; pars. 5-8) Before “day of Jehovah” apostasy had to come. (2 Thess. 2:3; pars. 12, 13) Meant a rebellion against Jehovah on part of ones claiming to be Christian, especially the leaders. Also foretold in other Bible books. (Acts 20:28-30; 2 Pet. 2:1-3; pars. 16-25) In time men claiming to be Christian did take to selves role of leaders, becoming clergy. (Pars. 27, 31, 34) This composite “man” set himself in opposition to God, demanded reverence. (Pars. 38-40, 42, 43) Apostles acted as a restraint to apostasy, which showed evidence of developing even while they were on earth. (2 Thess. 2:6; 1 John 2:18-22; pars. 44-46, 49-51) During Christ’s then future presence clerical “man of lawlessness” would be destroyed; means an end to apostates. (2 Thess. 2:8; pars. 52, 53) God lets this “man” operate, thus allowing those taking pleasure in unrighteousness to be deceived. (2 Thess. 2:9-12; pars. 59-63) Soon the end of “man of lawlessness” class, and of all apostates, will come. Just as earthly Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E., Christendom and rest of Babylon the Great will be destroyed, to be followed by rest of wicked system. (Pars. 67-69) Where do we stand? Are we actively aiding others to separate from that class? When apostates are gone, will we be here? What conditions then?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">millennium of peace and other blessings for those pursuing true worship noiv.</span><span class="font12"> (Chap. 19; 20 min.) Maybe feel insecure; not sure if you will survive. With apostates earth wide being destroyed, what reason can one have for confidence of life in paradise to follow? True, that end of entire wicked system to come in great tribulation, but Jesus promised that “flesh” would be saved. (Matt. 24:3, 21, 22; pars. 2, 3) This preservation, and outlook we can have, nicely described in Psalm 116. As psalmist looked to God for life, so must we. (Ps. 116:1-6; pars. 6, 7) We need the faith the psalmist and Paul had. (Ps. 116:7-11; 2 Cor. 4:8-10; pars. 9-12) After </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">final</span><span class="font12"> part of great tribulation, war of great day of God Almighty, will realize that God preserved us when he destroyed wicked. (Pars. 13, 14) Such deliverance into New Order will move us to appreciation. (Ps. 116:12-14; par. 17) Will see how precious to God are his loyal ones; he did not let Satan wipe them all out. (Ps. 116:15, 16; pars. 22, 24) What a joy it will be to have peace in which to express our gratitude to God by sacrifices of thanksgiving. (Ps. 116:17-19; pars. 26-28) Prospect of that preservation and of delightful peace of thousand years to follow should move us to share now in preaching, thus holding before others this prospect.

If you are able to do that, we encourage you to do so. Congregations will also be making special arrangements for midweek group witnessing. And in many locations, especially where Sunday meetings are early in the day, the congre-signed to answer the kind of questions that many people will have after having read the tract. If you go right back into the territories that you worked at the end of September and offer this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font12">no doubt many householders will be glad to obtain it. Offer it enthusiastically. Along with it you will have the October 15 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> which features the timely public talk from our recent international assemblies, “Divine Victory—Its Meaning for Distressed Humanity.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Later in the month you will have the October 22 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font12">which contains up-to-date material on the subject “Evolution—Facing Its Greatest Challenge.” This is current information, taking up matters that have developed since the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book was published. It is very revealing. We suggest that, in addition to presenting it from house to house, you especially offer it to anyone who showed interest in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book during September.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There is surely a wealth of fine material available to use in giving a Kingdom witness during October. May Jehovah bless our efforts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">gation will be invited to go out en masse to share in tract distribution afterward. Even if some are able to stay with the group only a short while, we encourage them to share with the congregation in this united witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">WHO MAY SHARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Who may have a share in the work? Certainly everyone who is already a publisher of the good news will want to do so. But remember, there are many people with whom you are studying and who are attending congregation meetings. Do some of them meet the qualifications to be publishers? Maybe they will want to assist you to distribute the message contained in the tract. And then after that, perhaps they will keep on sharing with you in making known the good news from .door to door. Invite them to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> This work is not difficult. It is something in which all can share. If your health permits you to call at only a few doors at a time, do that. If you can stay out for several hours, then do not hold back. Of course, serious ill health may prevent some from doing as much as they would like to do. But surely they can hand a few tracts to others or send them through the mail. And other publishers in the congregation will gladly assist them to distribute the remainder.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The extent of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and mercy is great indeed. Though under no obligation to imperfect humans, Jehovah has opened up the way for people of all nations and languages to have eternal life. (Rev. 5:9, 10; 7: 9, 10) Wanting all to benefit from his provision, he has put it into the hearts of his people to take time from other activities in order to proclaim the “good news” and to make disciples. And is it not an evidence of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and mercy that he has moved the governing body of the “faithful and discreet slave” to arrange for a new instrument—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. Hi—to help us in reaching many people quickly?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During the last ten days of September we will be offering this new tract to people everywhere. The distribution will be done primarily from house to house. We are going to ring doorbells or knock and then hand the tract to people personally. This type of distribution will no doubt encourage the largest possible number of persons to give it serious consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our presentation may he very brief. For example, we might say: “Hello. I’m glad to find you at home. I have volunteered to share in distribution of an important message. This is your copy; it is free. [Hand it to the householder.] Please be sure to read it.” Or, you could say: “This week hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world are delivering an important message to people. This is your copy. Please be sure to read it.” What you say may vary, depending on the attitude of people in your territory. In some areas you may find it beneficial to state that the message is from the Bible, or that it involves the meaning of world conditions. Use whatever method enables you to get it into the hands of the most people in their homes in a short time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If the householder asks whether you have the current magazines with you, or requests a book, feel free to supply it. But our principal objective is to reach as many homes as possible -with the tract. If you find someone who shows interest and would like to discuss matters further, we suggest that you make a note of the name and address and arrange to call later. Until this work is finished, our goal is to cover the territory quickly.</span></p>
<div><img src="km_E_197309_files/km_E_197309-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:447pt;height:6pt;">
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We want to deliver the tract to every building, every home, every family in our territory. However, no record will be made of those who are not at home. Instead, the tract should be left at the door so they can pick it up when they return. As you know, it should not be put in a mailbox, and it is best if it can be left out of sight of passersby. But be sure that each household receives a copy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Where you cannot get into certain apartment houses or call on the permanent residents in hotels, ask the doorman or the superintendent for si&gt;ecial permission to put the tract under the doors. He might let you do that without ringing the bells. You could also mail personal copies to some who cannot otherwise be reached. In some cases, you may choose to stand on the sidewalk outside a building to hand copies to residents as they come and go. But we will not be distributing the tracts promiscuously on the streets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Along with your other territory, we encourage you to call on business places. Give a copy of the tract to the owner or manager, and, if he grants permission, you may hand them to the other workers too. During lunch hour at your place of secular work, you may also be able to hand copies personally to fellow workers. And school-age publishers will no doubt want to deliver them to their teachers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Keep on offering the tracts as long as you have any available. Endeavor to get all of them into the hands of the public. But if you run out of them before the end of the month, then keep on working in the territory with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font12"> book or with the magazines. The September 22 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is a specially fine one to acquaint the public with the worldwide work of Jehovah’s witnesses, contrasting this with the religions of Christendom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> By vigorous activity on the part of all of us in presenting the good news, surely a fine witness will be given. At the same time we will be demonstrating our appreciation for Jehovah’s great mercy and undeserved kindness.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">* Is it proper for married couples to bring their domestic problems to the attention of the judicial committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If a married couple have some problems, they should try to settle these problems themselves in harmony with the counsel of God’s Word. However, if they are not able to do so and the problem is a serious one, it would be proper for either one or both to speak to the older men on the judicial committee.—See Matthew 18: 15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For example, a serious domestic problem would be the case of a man who physically beats his wife, doing her injury. A Christian should not be a smiter. (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7) Christians ought to produce the fruitage of the spirit, which includes selfcontrol and peace. (Gal. 5:22, 23) The husband should be loving his wife as he does himself.—Bph. 5:28, 29; Col. 3:19; also see 2 Timothy 2:24 and 1 Peter 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the evidence indicates that serious violence is involved, the congregation judicial committee would investigate the matter to find out what led to the mistreatment of the wife and give Scriptural counsel to both parties in an effort to restore peace in the family. They may find that it is necessary to give more than counsel; perhaps the man will have to be given private or public reproof. If a man proves to be a habitual beater of his Wife, being without self-control and fierce (2 Tim. 3:3), and he does not conform to the Scriptural counsel that was given by the older men in the congregation, the violent man can be disfellowshiped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the injured wife then decides to institute some court action against her disfellowshiped husband, feeling this to be necessary to protect herself from violence, this would not be out of line with the counsel recorded at 1 Corinthians 6:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Similar action can be taken if a complaint is brought to the older men that a member of the congregation is able, but not willing to provide for his family in harmony with 1 Timothy 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The congregation judicial committee should not spy into the personal, private family affairs of others; but when persons seek their counsel they have a great responsibility to judge matters in harmony with the Scriptures and to protect the good name of the congregation. When a case is brought to their attention, they should be. thorough in dealing with it and check later to see if the counsel they have given is followed and the needed improvement made. The older men seek to correct things that are defective, including serious domestic problems brought to their attention. —Titus 1:5.</span></p>

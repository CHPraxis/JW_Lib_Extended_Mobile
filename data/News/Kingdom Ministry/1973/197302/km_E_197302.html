<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">Be Industrious—Inherit the Promises</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our study of the Scriptures has revealed to us the many wonderful promises Jehovah has made. But who will inherit these? The apostle Paul, writing the Hebrews, answers : “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering. But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, in order that you may not become sluggish, but be Imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. G: 10-12) Jehovah is the Great Worker and he appreciates work done by us. So Paul reminds us that Jehovah will not forget our work, if it is the right kind of work. There must be industriousness, which means to _be steadily and perseveringly active and diligent. If we have been in Jehovah’s work in the past, this is good, but our determination is to continue showing this same industriousness down to the end, because •the reward is indeed great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Now we are in the midst of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription campaign. It is a time when we put forth an extraordinary effort to get new subscriptions. We can do much good by getting subscriptions from people in all walks of life. By now we have probably offered subscriptions to the interested persons we have met during the past year or those with whom we conduct studies. Perhaps through some of them we may get referrals and have opportunities to place subscriptions with people they know. However, such contacts may be limited in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Obviously, therefore, the best place for us to get our new subscriptions now would be by going</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">from door to door and offering the subscriptions with enthusiasm. It is easy to l&gt;e enthusiastic about the information in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font11">magazine. It always tells many good things and reveals good news about Jehovah’s wonderful promises. And </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> appeals to many kinds of people because of its great variety of very interesting information. We really have something available for everyone. Therefore we are equipped to succeed In our work, and we should learn to use our tools effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> An important step in equipping ourselves is to know what the magazines contain. So if we make it a point that as soon as possible after we receive our magazine we read through it, and as we do so we mark some outstanding points that we believe would appeal to people in our neighborhood, we will be in a good position to present the subscription offer in an interesting and convincing way. As we have become skillful in our work we have learned that we must </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">present the offer</span><span class="font11"> if we are going to succeed in placing it. The magazines will have greater appeal to householders if we draw attention to at least one main point in an article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Many of us are not now subscribers ourselves but are getting our magazines at the magazine counter in the Kingdom Hall. But this should not make us think that subscriptions are unimportant. We are able to get to the Kingdom Hall regularly so we do not miss any copy of the magazine. But people whom we meet in our field service arc not in that position. We are such busy people that perhaps we will not be able to go back and deliver each magazine regularly throughout the year, and especially so during winter’s stormy days. So, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">13 min: “Be Industrious—Inherit the Promises.” Give a talk and interview someone in congregation who has placed a subscription in door-to-door work, showing how industrious effort brings good results. May ask what had to be done. How many doors were called at before getting subscription? Show value of not giving up in work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Presenting the Good News. Questions and answers. Demonstrate how to present good news when youth opens door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 18 10 mln: Song 79. Introduction, text and comments. Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">18 min: “Your Service to God.” By means of questions and answers have a thorough coverage of first part of Chapter 6 in “Organization” book, through paragraph 2 on page 109. Read together majority of texts that are not quoted and draw attention to those quoted. Paragraphs do not have to be read. It would be better to use time to read and discuss scriptures. 20 mln: “Clean from the Blood of All Men.” After brief Introduction two or three sisters discuss points in insert down to heading “Family Cooperation Helps.” If possible use pioneers who may mention own experience if time allows to show what can be done locally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">since the magazines contain information that is vital to the people, the best arrangement for them is to be subscribers and get every issue throughout the year by mail, because they need the truth to help them to gain everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> While we are on this subject, it is good to mention that if there are any publishers who do not get to the Kingdom Ilall regularly because of living far away or because of infirmity, it would be good for all of those to have their own personal subscription. Thus they will always have the spiritual food coming to their home and will not have to wait for weeks sometimes before getting their spiritual nourishment at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Satisfaction comes from being thorough in our work. Our objective </span><span class="font10">discuss insert from heading “Family Cooperation Helps” to end. Conclude by reading last three paragraphs. Encourage each publisher personally to read the entire “Kingdom Ministry” insert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Concluding comments. Mention how many new subscriptions were placed by congregation so far in campaign. Draw attention to one or two points in latest magazines that should be of interest to people when you offer the magazines. Song 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WEEK STARTING MARCH 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: Song 73. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: “Making Your Family Study Fill the Need.” Question-and-answer discussion. Do not read paragraphs. Encourage a family study for all families, even though there may be no children. Example of family study on “Your Service to God,” “Organization” book, pages 112, 113. Family group consider methods of service used by Jesus and his disciples. In conclusion father points out how all should want to copy their methods of serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: “Let No Man Ever Look Down on Your Youth.” (1 Tim. 4:12) Symposium using younger publishers, if available, in presenting the following material. Can be more effective if youths on program work up their own presentations and rehearse before parents or overseers. Work in appropriate local experiences, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(4 min.) Chairman draws expressions from youths in congregation on how Christian thinking and conduct on their part serve to remove any reason for others to look down on their youth. Actions around home, school and Kingdom Hall many times speak louder than words. Should be like Timothy, who was an example in many ways, “in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.” —1 Tim. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) So as not to be looked down upon, youths’ conduct in and around Kingdom Hall needs to be exemplary. Form good habits early in life. Be attentive. Have own Bible and study materials. Unnecessary trips to rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this campaign is to help iieople through placing the subscription. However, we have learned from practical experience that, because of many differing circumstances, not everyone will subscrilie. What then? The next step could be to offer one of the small pocket-size books along with two magazines for a contribution of 35 cents. The small books do not weigh much, so it would be good to have a few copies available to offer when a subscription cannot be taken. Also, we may offer individual magazines.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Another step in our industriousness would be making a record of the placement made and. wherever subscriptions cannot be obtained but some interest has been shown, an extra effort can be made to return and build up a magazine route, placing the magazine issues </span><span class="font10">room while meeting Is on can be disturbing to others as well as causing one to miss part </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> the program. Encourage to go to rest room before meeting starts. Kingdom Hall is not a place for running and playing before or after meetings. Playing and loud noise outside of Kingdom Hall before or after meetings may annoy neighbors and cause them to look down on congregation's youth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Christian conduct in school will cause others to respect you. Reading, writing and arithmetic are good helps to prepare one for future service. Obedience to teachers, studying and paying attention in class are all important. A need to watch associations. —1 Cor. 15:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Earning respect from parents. Show deep love and respect for parents. (Eph. 6:1, 2) Christian examples of children have directed parents to truth. Appreciate what they provide for you In way of home, food, clothing and truth. Willingly and joyfully care for family responsibilities given by parents, washing dishes, mowing grass, etc. Obedience is pleasing to Jehovah and parents.—Col. 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(2 min.) Chairman. Youths' proper conduct now paves the way for future privileges of service. Brings praise to Jehovah's name, and greater respect from brothers. (Ps. 148:12, 13) Other youths in school and neighborhood, now looked down upon because of their conduct and thinking, will see good example and this may cause some to change, opening up way for witnessing and Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">17 min: Talk by presiding overseer on how much the youths are appre- , dated in the congregation. Commend them for their ministerial activities, meeting participation. Show from their Bible studies, return visits and placements what they are accomplishing in preaching the good news. If they have placed any subscriptions during campaign, may ask one to tell how he did it. Encourage them to keep up their line work and learn all they can, because they may be future elders and ministerial servants, pioneers, Bethel members, missionaries, which are all line privileges of service. Concluding comments. Song 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">regularly. Eventually .some on our route may become subscribers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Some weeks have passed since the start of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign, and during that time we have been able to contact many people. Some show interest to a degree, while a few manifest much interest. Did you get any subscriptions during January? Have you called back on those new subscribers yet? It is wise, once we have kindled the fire of interest, to return before too much time passes and add fuel so-there will be a larger tlame of interest. Our diligence moves us to want to help the new on&lt;&gt;s to appreciate the spiritual benefits they have. We know that often people require aid to understand articles on prophecy and the deeper tilings that appear in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 7, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark1"></a>&quot;Clean from the Blood of All Men&quot;</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">A</span><span class="font0">T MILETUS, on the west coast of Asia Minor, the apostle Paul met with the elders of the Ephesus congregation. In his parting words to them he said: “I know that all of you among whom I went preaching the kingdom will see my face no more. Hence I call you to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood of all men, for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.”—Acts 20:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The apostle Paul had no fear that he had failed in his commission to declare the “good news of the kingdom.” He knew that he had used his time well, both in caring for his personal needs by working with his hands and in instructing others about God’s will. He was confident that what he had taught by word and example would fully equip others to serve Jehovah as faithful disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. If any did abandon true worship, this could not be charged to Paul’s account. Their blood would be upon their own heads. —Acts 20:31-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Can we today have the same confidence? Certainly, provided that we, like Paul, are whole-souled in doing God’s will. Of course, it is appropriate for us to make sure that we are not lacking in some vital respect.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Consider Pioneer Service</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Like Paul, we should have the desire to help as many persons as possible to get an accurate knowledge of the truth, and we should want to remove obstacles that could limit our activity in the ministry. You may therefore find it helpful to talk to elders in the congregation about the possibility of your entering the pioneer service. Then, too, if certain circumstances are presently limiting your participation in the field ministry, you might ask yourself: Am I in position to change my circumstances? Would it be pleasing to Jehovah if I did so? Could I increase my share in Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking and still care well for my other Scriptural responsibilities? Could I enroll as a temporary or a regular pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If possible, you would certainly want to do that. Manifestly a dedicated, baptized witness of Jehovah could not have a completely clear conscience if he knew that he could do much more in spreading the “good news” but held back from doing it. It would be difficult for him to say, “I am free from the blood of all men,” if he were indifferently using up time in unnecessary pursuits, time that he could be spending in aiding others to gain an accurate knowledge of God’s life-giving word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, not all can pioneer, and no one should feel inferior because his circumstances make this impossible. Jehovah God and his Son are pleased with the whole-souled service of all true Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At times, however, we may think something is impossible for us and later find out that we can do it. That is why we can benefit from the example of others. What they have done may help us to see how we might enlarge our share in the work of Kingdompreaching and disciple-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When considering the experiences of those who have taken up pioneer service, think of your own circumstances and determine whether you might be able to join them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Housewives and Mothers</span><br><br><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Serving as Pioneers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Are you a housewife? Are you a mother? Many sisters serving as regular or temporary pioneers are. How do they do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister from Hawaii relates how she is able to pioneer although having three children and an unbelieving husband: “Each child has his or her own chores to care for after school. I make it a point to be home at least one hour before school is out. If I cannot reach home before the children return from school, I arrange for them to stay with their grandmother until I pick them up after field service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another mother serving as a pioneer in Hawaii says: “Being a pioneer, wife and mother requires many adjustments, and cooperation from all family members. I spend time in field service five days a week. On Monday I care for family matters and evenings are spent in personal study and association with my family. Since I pioneered when my children -were small, this evidently influenced them to make pioneering their goal in life too. While pioneering, I had fine opportunities to get my children out in the field service more often and this strengthened them spiritually. Additionally, our relationship as parent and child was greatly improved by giving them individual attention and having companionship with them in service. Serving as a pioneer has been a protection for me, because it has helped me to become free from selfish ambitions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the branch in Japan comes this report: “Many of the pioneers in Japan are housewives. With a good schedule, they have little difficulty in keeping their simple homes clean. Much of the field service time they put in while the children are at school. One pioneer sister goes in service leading her three-year-old twin boys, one by each hand. Another pioneers by bicycle, with one child sitting on a seat up front, and the other on a seat at the back. Mothers with school-age children often arrange to arrive home just as the children do, and to have Bible students come to the home at that hour, or to take the children on studies with them. There may be a child in the home where the study is held. In this case the child of the pioneer may conduct a study with that child.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The branch overseer from Korea writes that housewives are among the most effective pioneers in that land. Usually they conduct more Bible studies than do the other regular pioneers. Commenting on the general circumstances of these housewives, the branch overseer writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Most of the homes of the Korean brothers are very humble, consisting of just a room or two. This means less housework. However, without modern appliances, sisters must spend more time in preparing meals and shopping once or twice each day. Practically none of the sisters have washing machines. They get up early and perform their household duties so as to be in the field service by 9:00 a.m. They spend the time in the service when the rest of the family is at work or in school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What is moving so many housewives and mothers to take up the pioneer service and find real joy in it? It is love for Jehovah God and a sincere desire to help others to find the way that leads to eternal life. Their efforts have been richly blessed. Is the same love moving you to want to do as much as you can in declaring the “good news”? Even if circumstances do not permit you to be a regular pioneer, could you share in their joys as a temporary pioneer? Does your heart impel you to want to do so because of concern for people in your territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A sister from Portugal, where the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is banned, tells what moved her to take up temporary pioneer service: “At a circuit assembly I attended the meeting for those interested in pioneer service. The comments of the district overseer truly made me think. He said: ‘When you really love someone, don’t you gladly do something to show it? How are we showing our love for Jehovah? Perhaps we can do this more fully by serving as temporary pioneers.’ Since I always wanted to do this, I decided to talk with my husband about it. Although I have three young children, three, five and seven years old, we worked out a schedule for my mother, who lives with us, to care for the children during one month. Although being a family with limited financial means, we decided that my fifteen-year-old sister and I, along with another elderly sister from the congregation, could serve as temporary pioneers for one month in isolated territory, as an interested couple with whom I had studied moved to this area and offered us accommodations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Were the efforts of this sister and those who shared with her in temporary pioneer service rewarded? She continues: “What a wonderful time we enjoyed! Can you imagine our joy to have people come seeking us at the home where we stayed, saying: ‘I brought these neighbors of mine to hear what you told me, as they were not at home when you called yesterday’? During that month of temporary pioneer service, we talked to hundreds of people, right on the streets and roads, about the marvelous blessings of God’s kingdom. We had the privilege tc start nine Bible studies during this time. Several days ago I was happy to receive a letter from one of the ladies with whom I started a study. In part, the letter reads: ‘My dear friend, the more I learn about God’s Word, the more I thank God for having sent you to my home. Every day my husband reads a little from the books you left and is very interested in knowing more about God’s purposes.’ ”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Family Cooperation Helps</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font0"> in the case of this Portuguese sister who was aided to serve as a temporary pioneer because of her mother’s willingness to care for the children for a month, many others have been able to pioneer with the help of family cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Philippines many brothers do farming. When planting and harvesting are in progress, they are very busy. But when this work is finished, many share in temporary pioneering. One overseer reports that the family members take turns in doing so. Have you ever given consideration to what you might do to help various members of the family be temporary pioneers at different times of the year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the reasons why there are many pioneers in Korea compared with the number of publishers is family cooperation. The branch overseer observes: “Many family groups cooperate so that one or more members of the family can pioneer. Most Koreans marry and raise families. It is rare to see someone choose singleness. Nevertheless, after marriage and the family has been started, the couple often try to arrange things so that one of them can pioneer. This has happened more often when the couple operate a small shop together, rather than when the husband works for another employer. Jobs are scarce and when one has a job working for an employer it usually means twelve or more hours a day, every day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Regarding family cooperation, a brother serving in Portugal writes: “My wife and I rise every morning, following the schedule of the Bethel family, and from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. my wife gets much of the housework done, meals prepared, and so forth. Both of the boys have regular assigned duties, such as making their beds, keeping their room in order and, at mealtimes, one sets the table, while the other does much of the shopping. Many times during our pioneer career, goodpaying jobs were offered, almost invariably when we encountered some financial problem. I have been offered excellent paying salaries in Switzerland and France. Why, just the other day a local jeweler asked me to work for him at a fine salary. As a family, we are very happy with the necessities of life and are gladly following the excellent counsel found in Matthew 6:19-21.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Truly, when various members of the family share the work load, this makes extra time available, time that may be enough for at least one member of the family to be able to pioneer. Would this not be a blessed result from family cooperation?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Sacrifices May Have to Be Made</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Often those desiring to pioneer need something more than family cooperation. They may also have to change their circumstances to free them for pioneer service. An overseer in Nagoya, Japan, left a full-time job to care for a milk delivery route, beginning at 5:00 a.m. This leaves him ample time to care for his wife and child as well as to pioneer during the remainder of the day. The head surgical nurse at Fukuyama Hospital was able to switch to part-time nursing in another hospital so that she could be a temporary pioneer from the time of her baptism until she qualified to be a regular pioneer. There are a number of young doctors who work one or two days at the hospital to supply their material needs, and spend the rest of their time in pioneer service. Some chemists also use their practicing licenses to do just a little part-time work to support them</span><span class="font12">selves in the pioneer service. Other pioneers earn enough money to support themselves at jobs that people do not normally want to take, such as early morning newspaper deliveries, cleaning bowling alleys and offices. Sometimes two pioneers have taken one full-time job between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Hawaii a couple with two children sold a chicken farm and moved to another island to pioneer while their children were young. They expressed their feelings in this way: “Pioneering as an example to our children was the best heritage we could give them.” The father drove a school bus and did carpenter work part time to sustain the family financially, while he served as presiding overseer and as a regular pioneer. During the summer months the children served as temporary pioneers with their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another brother from Hawaii states: “My appreciation for the pioneer work came when my wife and two sons became pioneers. I had a good position with the telephone company for many years and, after twenty years with the company, decided to take early retirement, took on a parttime job and applied for regular pioneer service. Jehovah has richly blessed our efforts in full-time service. My two sons are now serving in Brooklyn Bethel, and I enjoy the companionship of my wife in the pioneer work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A couple in Portugal with a nine-year-old daughter learned the truth and felt so indebted to Jehovah that they made their goal the pioneer service. However, this would not be easy, since, in addition to the daughter, the wife’s parents had to be cared for as well as an eighty-year-old aunt. Not quickly deterred, the couple figured out the value of all theix' material possessions. Since they owned the apartment, they decided to turn this into an asset by renting it out. Thus their home would become a stepping-stone to pioneer service rathei’ than a hindrance. The rent received would greatly help to offset other expenses. Since they owned some property, it was decided to sell this now and use the income toward pioneer expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No sooner had they completed their plans than the foreign company where the husband was employed strongly urged him to continue, offering him a promotion. Relatives also brought pressure to bear, trying to fill the couple with fear about the uncertainty of the future. However, they held to their decision. Just three years after their dedication, they are enjoying many blessings in the special pioneer service. The couple are conducting a total of thirty home Bible studies. Their steadfastness in putting Kingdom interests first has also helped to move nine mexhbers of the immediate family to dedicate their lives to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truly, those who have given up material things to devote themselves more fully to advance Kingdom interests as pioneers have been richly blessed. A husband and wife, both of whom gave up goodpaying jobs to become pioneers, commented: “The past four years have been the happiest, the most blessed and gratifying years of our life, serving Jehovah as pioneers. There are no regrets, for we have been both spiritually and materially blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After considering your own circumstances, what do you think? Is pioneering for you? Can you adjust your circumstances and get by with less materially? Would it be possible to work together as a family so that at least one member could be a regular pioneer? Or, might it be possible, through family cooperation, fox<sup>-</sup> various family members to take turns in sharing in temporary pioneer service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If, aftex’ prayerful consideration, you see <sub>(</sub>the possibility of enlarging your participation in the field ministry as a regular or a temporary pioneer, why not set </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> date to start, and work toward that end?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As devoted servants of Jehovah God we certainly want to use time wisely in these &quot;last days.” When we are whole-souled in our service to Jehovah, we can rest assured of his blessing. Like the apostle Paul, we will be able to say, “I am clean from the blood of all men.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Your Family Study Fill the Need</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Parents, would you like to see your children take more of an interest in the family Bible study? Children, would you like to look forward to each family study with anticipation? Much depends on the subject to be studied and how the family head views the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It would be good for the family ' head to ask himself: “Is the study material appropriate to the needs of my family?” To be considered in conducting the family study are the ages and interests of the children. Consider these factors so that the children really take an interest. Or, perhaps some problem that has arisen in the family could become a topic for the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Some of the subjects that might be discussed at this time could be the holidays that are coming up. In the case of families with children in school, the study might be conducted so the principles having to do with the flag salute issue or the proper view toward sports and bad associations are made clear. It would be fine, too, to consider what the Bible says about respect for adults and how young Christians should conduct themselves in the school classrooms and the Kingdom Hall. Very helpful also would be to teach children to apply Scriptural principles concerning proper grooming and clothing styles. Parents could take advantage of the time to instill in their children the proper view toward dating and drugs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In all cases it is the course of wisdom to have material planned for the study. Do not just put things off and think that all will work out as the studies progress. One brother said of his family study when young: “We used to take a chapter in a book, regardless of what the subject may have been. Dad didn't, put it into language that we could understand so we lost interest in the study because of not being able to grasp the information or understand the principles involved.” True, it will take forethought and considerable research on the part of the family head? He should ask himself what </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font11"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>^o^uestion J5ox</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">• Can congregations with one or two elders get the help of elders from nearby congregations that have numerous elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes circuit overseers observe that one congregation has many elders while another congregation has only one elder, so some help could be used. The circuit overseer may make the need known to the congregation where there are many elders, but then it is up to the body of elders there to consider their own needs for elders to conduct studies and take care of the congregation activities. There is no reason for an elder to travel to another territory if he is needed where he is now. If they believe that it will not work a hardship in their congregation for an elder to go to work with a nearby congregation that has a real need of older brothers, they can discuss the matter among themselves and see whether anyone among them wishes to travel to the nearby congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Any elder considering such service should take intd account what this would mean to himself spiritually and physically and how it would affect bls family’s interests. He may wish to see how they feel about it. How much time would be required to go there and what are the traveling conditions and expenses Involved in going from his home to the territory of the nearby congregation? He should take into consideration the hours when the other congregation has their meetings. He will be wise to give such a matter his prayerful consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If, after such consideration of matters, someone is found to be available to serve with the nearby congregation, the presiding overseer may communicate with the nearby congregation to let them know that there is an elder who is willing to serve with them regularly. Upon receiving the information, if the brothers representing the nearby congregation wish to meet and discuss matters with the available elder they may do so. Then if they would like to have him serving with them they should send their recommendation of the brother to the Governing Body, asking that he be appointed to serve as an elder in their congregation, explaining the circumstances in the letter. When the recommendation is approved, the elder may serve In the new congregation and his name will be deleted from the list of elders of his former congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Overlooking an Important Field?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> These days in many congregations the territory is worked quite frequently. This is good because it provides an opportunity to meet different members of the household, who may react in various ways to tlie good news. But are you overlooking someone? If, for example, a twelve-year-old boy answers the door, what is your reaction? Do you say, ‘Is your mother at home?’ Perhaps tile boy's mother lias been witnessed to many t imes, but has the hoy ever heard the good nows of t lie Kingdom or about the Paradise earth that is to come?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> There is a wonderful field open to us among the young people and many of them respond well to the good news. Why not give a testimony that you feel will appeal to the young person? You may not find it practical to make the subscription offer. But most young people these days have a little money and it may be possible to place a 25-cent book such as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> book or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book. Many teen-agers would find the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Word of God</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution </span><span class="font11">books very interesting. If a young person will listen, give a testimony and open up the opportunity for this fellow human to learn of Jehovah’s wonderful promises. One can always ask to speak to parents after conversing with a youth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> On school holidays publishers will often find the children at home. One sister in Pennsylvania reported working a street witli four homes on it and at each home one of the youngsters came to the door. She told the youngsters about Jehovah's promises and placed a book at each of the four homes. Notation was made so a return visit could be arranged. Some of the young people are glad to have a Bible study. Also, on return visits parents and other members of the family are contacted, so the witness reaches all. It is reported from New York state that, in two instances where studies were commenced with a youth, the end result was that the entire family are now in the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It Is good to have a positive attitude toward the youths. Although they may have long hair, wear odd clothing or sometimes show an attitude of disenchantment with the present system of things and its injustices, often they like to enter into a conversation and discuss things. Some will respond favorably to the good news of the Kingdom and lie glad to see that there is a hope for the human family, which is just what they have been seeking deep down inside. Reports come from all around the world about young people who have been pleased to hear the good news. Some of the “hippies&quot; show great appreciation for the Society’s publications and the Kingdom hope, and today there are many former “hippies” who have become dedicated Kingdom publishers and some are in the pioneer service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> You will find the field service even more interesting If you prepare yourself to present the good news in language that will be understood by youths of varying ages, and your joy will be great as you see some of them respond favorably to the good news you present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">'/ On December 23 an earthquake virtually demolished Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, but not the Society's branch office and missionary home. Some brothers were injured, but none were killed. Brothers in El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras have provided relief supplies, and the Society has sent funds to aid in obtaining necessities. Witnesses outside Managua opened their homes to care for their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The Netherlands reports a new peak of 652 regular pioneers, to compare with 493 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ The report from Japan shows 24 percent of all publishers there in the pioneer service. Total pioneers: 3,590; regular pioneers exceeded 2,000 for the first time. Total publishers reached 15,126 for the 64th consecutive peak. ♦ Good progress is reported on Society’s new factory in Lagos, Nigeria. Two printing presses have arrived, to be used in printing some magazines there, </span><span class="font11">by lookiug up and reading aloud the texts will be a stimulus to them and will familiarize them witli the use of the Bible. After scripttires have been read, make a thorough examination of them. Reason on the points outlined in the texts and apply them. This will make the study of real practical value to all the family. It is most satisfying to have the right answer when and where it is needed. Ii'l the field ministry, at school, at the local grocery store or on the job, if you . know what to say and do at the right time it is very rewarding. Many are able to do so because they made certain that their study filled the needs of their family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is true that in many Christian homes one of the parents is not in the truth. If the father is a believer and the mother is not, it will be easier for the Christian man to take the lehd in studying with his children. Where the mother is a believer and the father is not, there will be need for discretion. While the Christian woman lias need of being in subjection to her husband, even though he may not be a fearer of God, yet tills need not stifle the training of children in accord witli Bible principles. If discretion is used, a mother can do much in the way of training her children in Jehovah’s laws during a time of the day that lends itself best for the family study. Whatever your family circumstances may be, it is imperative to have a family study, and to have one that will fill the need.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During recent months we here nt Bethel iiave experienced in ninny ways the reality of our international brotherhood. It has really been heartwarming. Not only did we have many visitors from other lands, but some of ns were able to attend assemblies in other lands and thus enjoy delightful companionship with the brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A number of us were at assemblies in Europe, where the combined attendance for all conventions was 502,494. It was thrilling to see tens of thousands there who have embraced the truth In the past few years and to feel their zeal and enthusiasm for pure worship. It was also a pleasure to meet brothers who had endured faithfully for many years, some during the Hitler era. Years of deprivation and imprisonment had not dampened their determination to spread the “good news.&quot; Their faces beamed with inward joy and appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Encouraging, too, was the hospitality of the brothers. Hosts went out of their way to make things comfortable, giving of themselves as would loving parents and children to members of their own families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those of us who got to the conventions in the Orient saw evidence of the same spirit of Christian brotherhood among the 77,3.31 at the various assemblies there. The saying goes that “East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.” But not so among God’s people. Missionaries from Western lands enjoy a splendid relationship with their Oriental brothers. Deep love for Jehovah has indeed caused East and West to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some of us were among those who toured the Bible lands, and we too had delightful experiences. Visiting sites from Mount Hermon in the north to Beer-sheba in the south made the Biblical events associated with them come to life in our minds. And we could appre-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Appreciating the Gift of Kingdom Work</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Work is indeed a gift. Not one of questionable value but one that has been proved to be of value. It is well known that a reasonable amount of physical labor brings a wide variety of beuelits to both mind and body. This being true of ordinary work, how much truer of Kingdom work, which produces results that can last forever. Here is a gift of surpassing excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Yes, what a privilege to be dedicated to the Sovereign of the universe and assigned a share in the tinal work of preaching the good news and making disciples. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) This work deserves our whole-souled participation. (Col. 3:23) By such work we lay up treasures in heaven for ourselves, and what work could result in greater good for others?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During the month of October we will work at presenting the subscription offer for A wale/ It should be our desire to aid as many people as possible to have the opportunity to become acquainted with the value of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">Having the special issues to work with during October will be particularly valuable in developing interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When you place a subscription or even one magazine, what might it accomplish? A missionary sister in Sierra Leone, West Africa, date more fully the great effort that Jesus, Paul and others put forth in accomplishing their ministry—most of it on foot. What a fine example they set for us!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Though the assemblies are now past, their effect should stimulate all of us to appreciate the gift of Kingdom work that is ours. To all of you we send our warm Christian love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your fellow servants,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font11">writes: “One Saturday while engaging in the magazine work I met a retired gentleman who readily accepted the magazines I offered him.&quot; The concluding paragraph of her letter says: &quot;He has progressed to the point where he now attends all the meetings. His next step, the field ministry, as he recently expressed his desire to be baptized at the district assembly in December.” Getting the magazines into as many homes as possible is a worthy goal.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do you share in the street magazine work? A pioneer from the Netherlands says: “When standing with the magazines by the station regularly we see the same people commuting to their place of work. It’s not uncommon to meet some of these persons in the door-to-door work. One lady told me she recognized me from standing by the station. She was very friendly and took two magazines. The following Monday while I was standing with the magazines she approached me, asking me to call back on a Sunday morning, because her daughter would like to know more about the Bible . . . The daughter Is making good progress.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> Do you enjoy making others happy? Then think of the joy that a single copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> brought to one downhearted person. She writes from Jamaica: “My search for the truth began in June 1971 when my sister died in an automobile accident. For the first time I sat down and thought deeply about life and what it all means. The funeral service gave me no answers and I grieved over my loss very much. One Saturday in June 1972 I remember walking home and as I opened the door I stepped on some paper. There was an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and an invitation to</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Educational Opportunities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As Is true of all of Jehovah’s provisions for his people, we enjoy greatly the benefits of the Theocratic Ministry School. Not only do we learn to express ourselves better, but everyone attending has the opportunity to grow in knowledge of the truth through the material that is considered. The Bible readings, life experiences, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font11"> material and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Rible Understanding</span><span class="font11"> assignments all contribute toward a wealth of up-to-date truths acquainting us ever more fully with our God, Jehovah, and his purposes. And now the new schedule that is included as an Insert to this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> shows that we will be covering the material in the new </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font11"> book. Here is another powerful reason why we will want to be sure to attend each session in the coming year if at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments: How Is “Awake!” subscription campaign goin$? Which presentations are proving most successful? Let publishers offer helpful comments but might have some prepared beforehand with beneficial ideas. Comment on Branch Letter. Song 86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Song 92. Introduction, text and comments. “Question Box.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Presenting the Good News —With the Book ‘God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.’ ” Chairman can offer some introductory comments regarding privilege of covering territory with the new book and need to have share. Then can discuss with audience some of the presentations suggested. Would be good to have one or two well-rehearsed demonstrations and then some closing comments by chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Our Special Public Meetings. Let congregation know about the arrangements that have been made for series of talks in new book “God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.” Remind brothers of how they can have full share in this special arrangement by reading as much of material as possible beforehand, by attending and by helping others to attend. Use introductory material in September “Kingdom Ministry” insert as basis for discussion. Point out that some will be able to read beforehand the chapters to be covered in coming public meetings, but others might be able to read only scriptures recommended for reading in advance. Be sure to emphasize how the brothers will benefit by advance preparation and attendance, and the need for all to be there. Might also make some general comments on congregation’s public meeting program and seek to build appreciation for arrangement as a whole.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Are there some new ones in the congregation who have been thinking about enrolling in the ministry school? Possibly now would be a good time to do so. Or, others who have hesitated, though associated with the congregation for some time, might now decide that it is time to enroll. Why not approach the ministry school overseer and speak to him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How are the brothers handling the number two talk, the Bible reading assignment? Possibly some could use a little help in understanding just how to do the necessary research that will enable them to make explanatory comments during the reading. Where this has been done well, botli the students and the audience have benefited greatly. Usually in each reading assignment there are a few scrip</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15 </span><span class="font9">min: Concluding comments. Comment on some of the Theocratic News items. Song 93.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING NOVEMBER 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Song 96. Introduction, text and comments. Discuss November theme, “Prove Our Faith by Firmness in Our Integrity,” by covering choice thoughts from March 1, 1972, “Watchtower,” in pars. 1-6, beginning on page 133; par. 19, page 138; and pars. 21, 22 on page 139.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Theocratic Educational Opportunities.” Possibly ministry school overseer could handle this. Some of the material could be given in form of a talk but can draw audience into discussion freely. Can also mention some good things that have taken place in local congregation’s ministry school recently, such as new students enrolled, improved talks being given by students, increased appreciation in evidence on part of brothers in general. Possibly there are some suggestions that can be given for improvement that school overseer could helpfully mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: “Service Meetings to Fit Your Congregation.” The presiding overseer might want to handle this. He could offer some introductory remarks for about two minutes and then call two or three responsible brothers to platform to discuss major points in article. Be sure to make local application where possible. In conclusion, audience could be given opportunity to make expression of what it is that they especially appreciate about the service meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">15 min: Concluding comments. Comment on any applicable Announcements. Draw from audience comments regarding placing the new book “God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.” Ask what publishers have found works best in presenting the offer in local territory. Song 97.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">tures that raise questions as to their meaning and application, and the clarifying comments by the student are very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Would not this be a good time for all in the congregation to review their schedules for ministry school preparation? Undoubtedly so. If you are able to read all of the material prior to attending the school, rejoice in the good that comes to you. If your circumstances do not allow you to do so, then seek to benefit to the full from the studying you are able to do and be determined to pay attention to all the talks and retain as much as you can. If you came away with just one good point from each of the talks, just think of what you would l&gt;e learning over a period of time! Yes, Jehovah has indeed arranged for tremendous educational opportunities for his people through the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>INSTRUCTIONS</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">During 1974 the Theocratic Ministry School should be conducted by all congregations as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> [w] and the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font11"> [ad]. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font11"> [sg], </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot;</span><span class="font11"> [si], </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security— From What Source?</span><span class="font11"> [tp] and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses</span><span class="font11"> [yb] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ORAL REVIEW: 5 minutes. The brother who gave the instruction talk the preceding week will present no more than ten questions on material he covered from the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ad</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">si.</span><span class="font11"> All may share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">INSTRUCTION TALK: No. 1: 15 minutes. This should not be just a summary of the assigned material. It should be a well-developed talk on a chosen theme, assigned to elders if possible or, when necessary, to qualified ministerial servants. The coverage should not be superficial but should provide a presentation that Is truly Informative and helpful to the congregation. When preparing talks from si, the speaker should read the corresponding information In ad to make sure that the points he covers will be up-to-date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 2: 6 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material. The reading assignments are short enough to permit the student to present explanatory Information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at fitting Intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, application of principles and expressions of appreciation for the wisdom reflected in the text may be included. The talk should be planned in a way that allows for all the assigned verses actually to be read. The allotted time should be fully utilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALKS NOS. 3 AND 4: 6 minutes each. These talks are assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering one of these talks, the student may be either seated or standing. Although using mainly notes and the Bible in many cases, the students, when appropriate, may read excerpts or quotations from the assigned material. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, the congregation or elsewhere; at times the presentation may simply be informative conversation between family members or others. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have his assistant (s) do so. Not the setting, but the material should be given prime consideration. Talks based on life experiences should be developed In Une with the assigned theme. The student may want to work in a scripture, relate the story and show how the fine example profits us personally. Also, when presenting material from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sg,</span><span class="font11"> the student may at times use an appropriate scripture or two to round out the discussion. On written review nights both talks should be developed in harmony with these instructions, except for timing.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SCHEDULE</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">Jan. 6 Bible reading: Numbers 22 to 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No. 1: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ad</span><span class="font11"> p. 886 H4 to p. 888 H2. &quot;Jehovah—Use of the Name in the Christian Greek Scriptures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No. 2: Numbers 24:13 to 25:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">No. 4: yb73 p. 53 H4 to p. 55 fl 2. “Serving Jehovah Zealously as a Family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">S-38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/73</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 5: 6 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience, It should be a talk to the entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the speaker, when fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with a Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material especially lends itself to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points In mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip. When a setting is selected, endeavor to choose one that will show practical use of the material assigned, where that is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">COUNSEL: Specific counsel on each student talk will be given, following the program of progressive counsel outlined at the bottom of the Speech Counsel slip. Appreciative comments on important points covered by speakers and remarks highlighting the value </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of.</span><span class="font11"> the Information to us can help to keep the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. Be careful to use no more than 2 minutes for each student talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TIMING: No talk should go overtime; neither should the counsel. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 will be stopped If necessary when the time is up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">WHEN WRITTEN REVIEWS ARE SCHEDULED: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ad, sg, si</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tp </span><span class="font11">and complete the assignment of personal Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during the review. Each student will check his own paper as the questions and answers are read. The next week the oral review will cover a few high points of the written review. If, for some reason, local circumstances make It necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule. The two talks scheduled that evening may be assigned to brothers or sisters. Thirty minutes will be set aside for the review and the talks will be limited to five minutes each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of fifty or more students should arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other elders, if possible. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it seems advisable, sisters may take any talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talks Nos. 3 and 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ABSENTEEISM: If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer will take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Meetings to Fit Your Congregation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “And all your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant,” promises Isaiah 54:13. The service meeting is one of the arrangements through which such teaching comes. Everyone in the congregation can contribute to making it an enjoyable and beneficial meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- Almost all service meetings follow the time schedule and material outlined in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font11">However, occasionally that information might apply differently in various congregations and so the elders and ministerial servants who present the information should do so with flexibility. For example, the article “Challenging, Yet Rewarding, Territory” in the June 1973 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> applied primarily to larger cities. Thus the brothers in small towns and rural areas, while applying these suggestions to their local areas, did not need to spend as much time covering the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When information in a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> article does apply directly to the congregation, then the one responsible for the presentation should prepare that material thoroughly so the audience fully understands and appreciates how it applies locally. Apparently in some instances the one assigned concludes that all In the congregation have read the information and are fully acquainted with it and so he does additional research so as to present his own “fresh” material and not “rehash” what is in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> At times this is done in the form of a long, drawn-out introduction. But it would be more profitable if he used that time to consider the assigned article Itself and to aid the congregation to see how to apply it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some have asked questions regarding how best to conduct the discussions of the Scriptural subjects occasionally outlined under “Your Service Meetings.” They have felt that there is too much material and in some instances have gotten only halfway through. For example, in the outline “How Well Do You Know the Organization?” in the September </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> there are about fifteen Scripture references in addition to publication references. The chairman really should arrange for a rounded-out discussion of the entire subject. It is not intended that all scriptures should be looked up and read during the discussion. The same is true of references to publications. These are included so that publishers can look them up at home as they prepare and then bring these thoughts into the discussion, possibly only briefly. Thus some time can usually be given to each question, key texts chosen in advance can be read, the discussion will move along briskly and the congregation will benefit because all points are covered in a balanced consideration.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The question has been raised as to how the brother assigned can adequately conclude the service meeting when only ten minutes are set aside for both “Concluding Comments” and “Branch Letter” as in the September 1G service meeting. He will have to decide how the time will be distributed, but in this instance likely only a very few, choice, brief statements would be made on the “Branch Letter.&quot; He is responsible to see that the service meeting ends on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Who should be selected to demonstrate the various Scriptural presentations and literature offers or otherwise show how the good news might be delivered? It should usually be the more capable and experienced publishers who are asked to do this. Additionally, they should have been Instructed and rehearsed by the chairman of that assignment. It is generally not best for new and inexperienced publishers to demonstrate how the work is to be done simply because we want them to have the opportunity to be on the platform, although some can be used as householders. They will have many opportunities to get experience through commenting at the meetings, giving student talks in the ministry school and participating in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> If the service meetings at times seem not to be as interesting and instructive as they might be, it would be good for the presiding overseer and, in fact, the body of elders, to consider the matter to see if application of some of the above thoughts might help. Both those in the audience and those on the platform, with forethought and preparation, can contribute toward making the service meetings upbuilding and joyful occasions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> This month, when we are aiding others to appreciate the value of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.'</span><span class="font11"> and encouraging them to subscribe, is a good time to think of the advantages of subscribing ourselves. When we subscribe we make more certain that each issue is delivered to our home and often this is done before we could get distributors’ copies at the Kingdom Hall. Thus we can be reading the new magazine sooner, for our own benefit, and also preparing to present it effectively in the field when the release date for the distributors’ copies arrives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> There is no need to hold back from entering personal subscriptions, feeling that these would be more work for the Society. In the past it was suggested that the brothers pick up personal copies at the Kingdom Hall rather than subscribe. Your cooperating during this period was a great help and was very much appreciated. But we want all to know that now we will be very glad to mail the magazines directly to your homes. Encouraging others to subscribe is more convincing when we ourselves are subscribers. Of course, this applies to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> also.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Undoubtedly, this would also be a good time to review our individual needs as far as distributors’ copies are concerned. Could we, with a little planning, increase the number that we order and place? Heads of families might consider how the children are sharing in magazine distribution and whether</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Book “God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In November we will have the opportunity for the first time to present, in the regular house-to-house work, ttie new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached.</span><span class="font11"> Here is something entirely new to offer in the territory. In presenting the book each publisher should feel free to do so in the manner that he believes lie can handle best and that he feels is best in his territory. Some will want to begin with a Scriptural discussion, while others might prefer to offer the book directly. The following suggestions can be used or they can be adjusted to what you personally prefer:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One might say: &quot;There are many honest-hearted people who would like to see the establishment of a government that is truly dedicated to righteousness, and which will last. Our brief call is to encourage people to listen to what God himself has to say about the establishing of such government. Speaking of the thousand-year reign of Christ and those who would rule with him, Revelation 20:6 says, [readl. With such individuals ruling, we can be sure the government will be of the best kind. This book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Ilas Approached,</span><span class="font11"> will show</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Appricioting th« Gift of Work </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">the Kingdom Hall the next day. The article ‘Why Must Even Youths Die?’ made me jump for joy—all my questions were answered I That same night I got out my clothes to attend the meeting the next day. Sunday I spent reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake 1</span><span class="font11"> and resting, and at 6 p.m. I attended my first meeting. A young sister asked if I would like to have a home Bible study, which I eagerly accepted. My friends opposed, but I paid them no mind, as I knew I had found the truth. Soon after we completed the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book, I was baptized, April 7, 1973. Now life has real meaning and purpose for me. 1 hope to see my sister again in the resurrection.” Could it be that some of the magazine and subscription work you do in October will turn out this way ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">why it is a certainty and the evidence that it is near.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Or, one might ask: “Do you think it is possible to establish a completely righteous government that will last for a thousand years?” (Pause for reply.) This publication, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached, </span><span class="font11">shows clearly that God has just such a government in mind for this earth. We place the book on a contribution of just fifty cents.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> After a brief introduction regarding your call, you might show the book, read the title, then say: &quot;Here on page 18, after quoting Revelation 19:11 through 20:10, where God’s thousand-year rule is discussed, it points out ...” Then read paragrapli 28 or as much of it as you think appropriate, or, read paragraph 30. Then make the presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Would you enjoy covering your territory with a Kingdom sermon again? Then you might prepare something using Matthew 6:9, 10, showing that the main purpose of the Kingdom is to accomplish God’s will, and Revelation 21:3, 4, showing that tlie Kingdom will restore health and life to mankind in a paradise earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> It will certainly be a pleasure to present this new publication in our territory. Surely Jehovah’s blessing will be with us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During the last ten days of September you shared in delivering </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 16 to people in your territory. They have had opportunity to read it. But what was their reaction? Even if they were favorably impressed, many of them will not do much about it until one of Jehovah’s witnesses again calls at their home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> That is why it was recommended that, following our tract distribution, we go right back into the same territory and cover it again. It was suggested that we ask the people whether they read the tract In many cases this will open the way for fine discussions and opportunities to start Bible studies. By offering magazines and subscriptions we also give them further opportunity to read and</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ There were 2,017 regular pioneer applications received by the Brooklyn office during August. The previous peak was 781. There is vital work to be done in the field, and the brothers are eager to have a full share in it.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Q^aestion Box</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">• Is it all right for the congregation or a few brothers to hold a &quot;garage sale&quot; or other such “sales” for the financial benefit of the congregation and make It a congregation matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a member of a congregation wants to hold a &quot;garage sale,&quot; that is something of a personal nature and for him to decide. What he docs with such proceeds thereafter would also be a personal matter. However, it is never appropriate for anyone to make such sale a congregation matter or indicate in any way that the congregation is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each Kingdom Hall provides a contribution box where contributions for the congregation can be made on a completely voluntary basis. The Scriptures clearly indicate that Christians should have the opportunity to contribute for necessary congregation expenses, but this should be done willingly, from the heart, not by appealing to a desire for personal material gain in return for what is given.—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">the order should lie increased for their sakes. Do we always pick them up on time? Are we holding' to good schedules in magazine work, appreciating that this is dated material and should be placed while current? These and related factors regarding magazine distribution might be considered now while they are fresh in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">build up their confidence in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Have you done this follow-up work? If not, loving concern for our fellowman should move us to start now. If you distributed a hundred tracts during September, then there are a hundred households that could benefit from special calls on your part during October.</span></p>

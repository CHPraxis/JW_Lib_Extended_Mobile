<p><span class="font10">Watchtower Fann has been the scene of a lot of excitement lately. The Society has completed one new factory there and another one, a huge building, is well under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since February 2 the first factory there at the farm has been producing literature for your use in the field. On that day, just a few weeks ago, the first magazines rolled off one of the printing presses in that new factory. And how this delighted the large family that serves on your behalf there at Watchtower Farm! Now two presses are running, and there are more to come. Three more large rotary presses have already arrived from Germany, and soon these will be erected, ready for production. Our brothers there are willing and eager to supply all &lt;1 the magazines that you can possibly use in proclaiming the good news!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the new printing facilities, our capacity for producing magazines and handling subscriptions lias been greatly increased. So we are now able to invite all of you publishers in the continental United States to have personal subscriptions for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for responding so well to the recommendation in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> to obtain personal copies of the magazines at the Kingdom Hall when that seemed advisable. While some may prefer to continue doing that, doubtless many of you will again want to have both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> sent directly to your homes. If you and other memlters of your family would like to have personal subscriptions, we will be pleased to provide that service for you now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As for magazines sent to or from other lands, due to the high postal rates it is requested that publishers continue to get personal copies from the congregation’s supply, if that is what has been done up till now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Something else that brought a lot of joy to members of the Farm family recently was the visit of the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Share in the Joy of Giving</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The most valuable gift that we can give to others is Bible knowledge. For the receiver, that knowledge can mean everlasting life in God’s new order. (John 17:3) Do you have the joy that comes from having a full share in giving of this vital knowledge to others?—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Our participating in the house-to-house ministry to the extent that our circumstances reasonably permit is an excellent way to share in the joy of giving. By endeavoring to call at every home, we are acting in harmony with Jehovah’s desire for ‘all sorts of men to be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.’ —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Consider your own circumstances. Do you have a regular time for sharing in the house-to-house ministry? Could you enlarge your share in this activity? It may be that you have been making return visits on certain people over a pe-Gilead students on March 3. Brother Knorr took them there on a visit after they had completed their final examinations at school. Of course, the students were enthusiastic about seeing the new facilities there at Watchtower Farm. As for the Farm family, they thoroughly enjoyed the comments that Brother Knorr gave that day, as well as the excellent program that the students put on for them. Then, on graduation day, March 5, they repeated the program for the Bethel family, and their friends and relatives, gathered in New York city. It was a stimulating, enthusiastic program, featuring two magnificent Bible dramas. And Brother Knorr announced that both of these dramas are scheduled to be on the program at the &quot;Divine Victory” International Assembly this summer. Don’t miss it!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Be assured of our warm love for all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">riod of months or even years. They may enjoy listening to you and accept literature. But they may have made little progress. Perhaps they have not even once come to the Kingdom Hall. Yet, if you were to take some of the time spent in talking to those who have made little progress and devote it to the house-to-house work, you might lie able to find people who are really longing for the truth. While not all respond favorably, is it not true that the house-to-house ministry is one of the main ways to locate those who are “sighing and groaning”? (Ezek. 9:4) So why not put forth a special effort in the weeks ahead to search out persons looking for the truth?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The special issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> can help you in this regard. Even those who are not religiously inclined feel the painful effects that death brings. So they could benefit from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer’s </span><span class="font10">presentation of the resurrection hope. And who is not concerned about the increasing crime and violence? Truly, then, the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> featuring “What Can Be Done About Crime?” will have wide appeal. Have you made definite plans to put forth a special effort in the distributing of these special issues? It is good to keep in mind that these magazines can help those reading them to become servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is certainly encouraging to see Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts to declare the “good news.” Many of those with whom Bible studies were conducted are now sharing in the field ministry. Other Bible students are attending meetings. We are looking forward to the time when their hearts will move them to share in the house-to-house work. Some of them may already be aware of their privilege to participate in this grand activity. Are we alert </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: Have Regard for Those Working Hard. (1 Thess. 5:12, 13) Group composed of ministerial servants and publishers discuss ways they can assist elders who have &quot;plenty to do.&quot; (1 Cor. 15:58) Can help best by being obedient and submissive. (Heb. 13:17) We can avoid being critical when things are not always arranged as we personally might prefer. Be willing to overlook their shortcomings; they are imperfect as we are. (Col. 3:13) Respond to their counsel; do not attempt to justify yourselves or raise issues over minor things. Do not burden them unnecessarily with matters that must be decided by our own conscience; each one ‘must carry his own load.’ (Gal. 6:5) Husbands and fathers especially need to shoulder their responsibility to make decisions involving the family, not shirking their obligations of headship. (Eph. 5:23) Volunteering to assist in performing various tasks related to congregation activity is always appreciated. Their anxiety about the congregation is considerably lessened when they know they can depend on us to care faithfully for any assignment given to us. We can take the initiative ourselves to encourage and assist those needing spiritual upbuilding; this reinforces their efforts to &quot;support the weak.” (1 Thess. 5:14) We can help a great deal by turning in reports promptly and checking to be sure they are accurate. Because these brothers unselfishly give their &quot;own souls&quot; in our behalf, we ‘reckon them worthy of double honor.’ (1 Thess. 2:7, 8; 1 Tim. 5:17) Appreciation should prompt us to cooperate fully and to keep &quot;holding men of that sort dear.&quot; (Phil. 2:29) Additionally, discuss ways that each one can assist in any other matters currently affecting your congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">15 min: Are You Reporting All Your Activity?

Let the congregation know what problems have been encountered locally in this regard. Invite audience to offer comments and suggestions on what can be done to ensure complete, accurate reports. Questions that can be considered: How are reports helpful to the Society and the congregation? How can we keep an accurate record during the month? (Do not rely on your memory; make notation after each period of service. May use field service report slip; keep in your Bible or briefcase. Parents can remind children. Overseers can remind all to report at meetings toward end of each month. Be sure to Include time spent witnessing informally.) What should you do if you forget to turn in your report? (Turn in the complete report next month; it will be included in the congregation’s report and noted on your card. Prompt reporting, however, is much to be preferred.) What method of reporting have you found works well for you? (Invite someone in audience to offer suggestions . on what he has found to be practical ways to record and report his activity.) Although it may seem to be a small matter, this is another one of the ways we prove ourselves to be faithful.—Luke 16:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Covering Unworked Territory <sub>r</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Two sisters who traveled from California to South Dakota last summer to help a congregation to cover unworked territory stated: “We’ll have memories for a lifetime. We recommend it to others.” A couple from New York city who attended the assembly in Denver, Colorado, and worked some territory in Kansas on the way home expressed themselves similarly. Four publishers from Washington working in North Dakota said: “We found the people friendly and receptive, and literature was placed at almost every home.’’ A family from Colorado that traveled to Nebraska for a weekend said : “All four of us felt that weekend to be one of our finest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During the summer months this year regular pioneers serving as temporary special pioneers will spend a number of months working territory that is not assigned to any congregation. While you may not be able to share in such activity, l&gt;ossibly you would be able to spend a few days working territory assigned to a congregation but not worked for a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If you want to assist in covering uuworked congregation territory, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Soon the 1973 “Divine Victory” International Assembly will be under way. Have you made plans to attend? The cities and dates for the twenty-four conventions in the United States and Canada are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Covering Unworked Territory </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">please discuss matters with the presiding overseer. Let him know how many territories of two to three hundred homes you could work and how far you would be able to travel. Please give the needed information to your presiding overseer early enough so he can mail it to the Society no later than May 1. Generally speaking, the need for additional help is greatest in midwestern and southern states. A form has been sent to the presiding overseer of most congregations covering their territory at least once each year. It is requested that he use it in sending information to the Society regarding persons in the congregation who qualify to share in such activity. If your congregation is not covering its territory at least once each year it '« would be best to concentrate on covering unworked territory in your own congregation instead of traveling to some other congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Where assignments are made to give assistance, the presiding overseer of the congregation needing help will be given written notice from the Society. A copy of the letter will be sent to the presiding overseer of the congregation offering assistance. The congregation needing help can then supply specific information regarding the territory to those volunteering to work it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Those sharing in covering unworked territory during the summer months will have to make their own arrangements for housing, etc. Have in mind also that most of the territory needing attention is rural, so a serviceable ear will be needed. Also, it would be best if just a few persons work in each car group.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DID WE DO IN JANUARY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our report reflects a fine upward trend in zealous activity. From December’s 421,895 publishers we increased in January to 430,695! And both magazines and total hours showed an increase ot well over half a million from January of 1971. It was especially good to see that publishers averaged 9.9 hours, and regular pioneers 100.6 hours, and that home Bible studies increased 15,000 from December. Very fine indeed! It certainly is commendable that so many saw the need to exert themselves vigorously in publicly making known Jehovah’s name and kingdom. </span><span class="font10">in Los Angeles, it is requested that the respective circuits attend each assembly as shown. Also, the facilities in Toronto are not as large as those in Pittsburgh. Hence, although the New York circuits listed for Pittsburgh are closer to Toronto, it would be far better for them to attend the assembly at Pittsburgh, where there will be plenty of room.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering the “Paradise—Theocracy” Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We have good reason to be enthusiastic about offering this book during tlie month of May. But how, you may ask, can we generate interest in the contents of a book that relates the affaifrs of an ancient people seemingly far removed from our day? How can we convince the householder that the writings of little-known Hebrew prophets have force and meaning for us today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Many enjoyed good success using the Scriptural presentation suggested in the October </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font10"> After commenting on our mutual desire for good government, you could ask: &quot;Would you be interested In knowing what the Bible says the future holds as regards rulership over all the earth?” If the householder responds favorably, you can read Revelation 11:18, pointing out Jehovah’s promise to bring to ruin those ruining the earth. The wonderful blessings that will be realized under divine rulership can be emphasized by reading Revelation 21: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> You may prefer a simple presentation using just the book itself. After an appropriate introduction, you could raise the question: “Do you believe that peaceful, happy conditions will ever be possible on this earth? [Allow comment by householder.] In spite of intense efforts by the major governments to establish a lasting peace, many are inclined to feel that it is unrealistic to expect this in our lifetime. The Bible clearly shows, however, that a peaceful, happy world not only is possible, but has been promised by God. [Open book to title page.] Man's existence on this earth began in a paradise created by God . . . [Read Genesis 2:8.] Man lost paradise by his disobedience, but God has made provision by His Son to restore it. Before lie died, Jesus made a promise that gives us a solid basis for hope . . . [Read Luke 23:43.] You may find that hard to believe. [Refer to page 7, paragraph 3, noting comments on reasons for belief.] This book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Restored to Mankind—By Theocracy!</span><span class="font10"> discusses the Bible prophecies that confirm this hope.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise-Theocracy</span><span class="font10"> book contains a most worthwhile message; an opportunity to read its contents can be a blessing to the people in your community. It would be good to cover as much of your territory as possible with this offer during the month of May. Make sure that interested ones already contacted get an opportunity to receive it. All those currently being studied with should be encouraged to obtain and read it. Let them know when and where the book is studied each week by the congregation, and invite them to attend. Also, many calls will be made during the month on those who subscribed during the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">campaign; offer it to them too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> You will undoubtedly want to make return visits on all with whom you make placements, making an effort to start studies. If the paradise hope appeals to the householder, you may have an excellent opportunity to stimulate further interest through a regular study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Convention Time Approaching </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">us that the assembly facilities in Halifax are quite limited but that publishers in the northeastern I’uited States who want to go to Montreal can be accommodated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Due to new regulations affecting use of Yankee Stadium in New York, the program there will not begin until 0 p.m. on Friday, and that opening session will close at 9 p.m. On Saturday the program will begin at 9 a.m., and on the following days at 19 a.m. On the last four days of the assembly it will conclude at about 6 p.m., a little later than in other cities, so that nothing will be missed as a result of readjusting the first day's program. The public talk will be on Sunday (followed by a Bible drama), even though the New York assembly extends through Tuesday. In other cities, the program each day will usually run from 9:55 a.m. to 1 p.m. and then from 2:55 to 5: 30 p.m.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The Society will be sending a supply of room request forms to each congregation. Please fill out the form very carefully and mail it, NOT to the Society, but directly to the address of the rooming headquarters shown thereon. Do this no earlier than six or seven weeks before the assembly of your choice.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font9">• How are expiration slips that arc sent to a congregation to be handled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An expiration slip is sent to the congregation two months after the expiration date if the subscription is not renewed. Many fine experiences have resulted from following up such calls promptly. When these slips are received, it is requested that the Bible study overseer distribute them. If it is known that some former subscribers are presently’being called on regularly by certain publishers, it would be logical to give the slip to them. Otherwise, the slips may be distributed to any publishers who can be depended upon to make the calls and follow through on interest found. Some congregations find it best simply to distribute the slips to the book study conductors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If publishers are unable to make contact on these calls for some reason, it would be good to return these to the Bible study overseer or the book study conductor, so he can give them to others who may be able to call at a different time. If repeated efforts to contact the person are unsuccessful, letters can be written by publishers whose health or circumstances limit their share in the house-to-house ministry. When the circuit overseer visits, he can be given any slips currently on hand, but they should not be allowed to accumulate for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Occasionally the congregation may receive a slip with an address not in its territory. If that territory is held by a nearby congregation, the slip may be sent there. If not, please return it to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Slips regarding “undeliverable” magazines are often sent out. If you can obtain the information needed to assure future delivery of the magazines, please note this on the slip and return it to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time it would be good for overseers to ask all the publishers to check their notebooks and bookbags carefully for any slips they may have neglected to follow up.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 1973 “Bit </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wb,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for oir part, shall walk In the name of Jehovah oar God to time Indefinite, even forever.”—Mie. 45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOL.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">^Kingdom ^PubCiskfts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the big questions that Jehovah's witnesses everywhere are asking is, How are our brothers and sisters who tied from Malawi?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Perhaps you read news reports about the critical conditions in the refugee camp at Sinda Misale. Later dispatches declared that, under the supervision of UN representatives, the Witnesses had ^willingly”' been returned to their villages in Malawi. Ale these reports true? Where are those brothers now? And what happened to the ones who fled into Mozambique?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has now been possible to interview hundreds of these brothers, and a detailed report is being published in the March 8 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> They have undergone severe hardships, and these are not over. But Jehovah has sustained them, and the majority have maintained their integrity despite everything That Satan has brought against 'thenv^JoEn 14: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The treatment to which our brothers in Malawi have been subjected Is something that the world ought to know. This provides good opportunity to set before them again our Scriptural position toward involvement in the political affairs of the nations and to let them know that our support goes </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font11"> to Jehovah God and his kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> sets forth the issues clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society believes that a fine witness can be given, to Jehovah’s honor, by getting this March 8 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> into the hands of public officials and news editors everywhere. Who is willing to have a part in the work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special letter outlining how it is to be done will be sent to each congregation. The activity should lie coordinated by the field overseer in cooperation witli the presiding overseer. In order to get the work under way, we encourage each congregation to estimate how many additional copies of the magazine will be needed for special distribution to officials and for house-to-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Living According to God's Purpose in Delivering Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It Is good to know that we are still living in the “day of salvation.&quot; The apostle Paul wrote to Christians when that day for Christians was in its early 'hours’: “Working together with [God], we also entreat you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose. For he says:/*In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.’ Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look' Now is the day of salvatiou.”A-2 Cor. 0:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup>That “day'of salvation” is more than 1,900 years advanced and it now nears its conclusion. But its being still iu effect gives us yet a short time to prove our own integrity to Jehovah's sovereignty by clean Jiving anil right works. We also can buiia ourselves up for the stresses to come as we get very close to the ending of God’s “acceptable time.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> God is providing this “acceptable” time, not merely for us who are now JeTiovair&lt; withesses, but also for other</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">s whose</span><span class="font11"> lives are in imminent danger. Here is further opportunity for us to prove our devotion and love. For we show genuine love for Jehovah when we demonstrate love for our fellowman by bringing him the good news. In many cases it means “putting ourselves out,’ but are we not glad someone has done that very thing for us?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">house work. Then send off your order by airmail right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This will be a big job. But with concerted effort a grand witness can be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May Jehovah bless you all as, by your zeal iu his work, you show that you truly are living in accord with his purpose in delivering his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The month of March is filled with opportunities for helping those who manifest interest in God’s purposes. An outstanding feature is the special public talk, “How Resurrection Benefits All the Dead in Hell,” to be delivered at all Kingdom Halls on Sunday, March 25. Invite people to the talk. Their attention should be aroused by the striking title of the talk, with the words “resurrection” and “hell” in the same sentence. All who attend the special talk should also be Invited to attend the Memorial on April 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In addition to each one of us sharing fully in the field ministry during March and April, let us make a special effort to help new ones with whom we have teen studying and who qualify to begin sharing in the public ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> This third month of the subscription campaign is a good time to review your possibilities for obtaining subscriptions. It may be that you have,the names of several who promised to subscribe. Be sure to call back on them as you continue to share fully in the house-to-house work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As you sincerely present the subscription offer, honest-hearted ones will see the value of the magazines. Even with rising costs, a year’s subscription can still be provided at the amazingly low cost of $1.50. Spiritually hungry ones count this as nothing compared to the comfort and enlightenment received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> In the closing ‘hours’ of God's “day of salvation,” it is indeed a happy time to be alive, spending our lives according to God’s purpose. May we assist many others to share this happiness and walk witli us in the way to everlasting life before Jehovah closes the “acceptable time” and begins his day of wrath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">20 min: &quot;Organization&quot; book, p. 113, par. 3, to p. 116, par. 2. Questions, with answers from audience. Highlight the scriptures cited in support and illustration of points made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Discuss briefly congregation report for February and encourage all to consider how they might increase time devoted to the field ministry during March and April. Are some new ones ready to begin field service? Can more be temporary pioneers? Song 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Song 27. Introduction, text and comments. Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Let the Magazines Help You to Preach.&quot; Questions and answers. Interview several publishers who have good success in placing magazines. Have them tell briefly how and when they do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Organization&quot; book, p. 116, par. 3, to p. 120, par. 4. The brother handling this part may want to consider the sections in this portion by interviewing brothers looking after the literature and territory for the congregation, also one or two book study conductors. If this is not convenient, the part may be handled by a talk or by questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Encourage all to participate fully in Jehovah’s service by imitating the Master, Christ Jesus. Use highlights of his ministry as discussed in January 1, 1973, &quot;Watchtower.&quot; Song 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 mln: Song 28. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Organization&quot; book, p. 121, par. 1, to p. 124, par. 4. Questions and answers from audience. May take material by sections so as to emphasize following points: Reasons for revisits (p. 121, pars. 1-4); reasons for home Bible studies and how to start them (p. 121, par. 5, to p. 122, par. 1); method of conducting studies (p. 122, par 2); building proper qualities in disciples (p. 123, par. 1, to p. 124, par. 1) and developing heart appreciation (p. 124, pars. 2-4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">16 min: Making a Personal Examination. (To be handled by or in cooperation with field overseer.) All publishers invited to reflect back over the past year to see what has been personally accomplished in the field ministry as the activity of the congregation for the past year is briefly considered. Nationally there have been fewer hours devoted to the field ministry during the past service year In comparison to the previous year, ' even with more publishers sharing in the preaching work. And hours continue to be slightly lower so far this service year. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Could it be that some of us have had a little difficulty doing our best without goals being stressed or special efforts being made to help us to get out in field service and to report each month? Now that there is less checking of records to see who have not reported and what we are doing in preaching-, we are put more on our own, are we not? It puts us to the test as to what we will do without someone urging us regularly to share in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As we individually think about what we have been able to do during the past year, likely some fine blessings will be recalled. Our own hours may not have dropped off but may actually have increased. We may now have a Bible study. These are causes for rejoicing. But where we find room for Improvement, we will want to put forth the effort needed to refine our schedules or show more love and zeal for Jehovah's service. We may find that our hours have decreased without real cause and perhaps, if a study was discontinued, added effort could enable us to replace it with another one. Or, if we have never conducted a study, it may be possible to start one now as we continue without letup, looking to Jehovah to bless us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is good to examine our own activity from time to time and draw our own conclusions about what has been accomplished and what might be improved. In coming months, will it be possible to spend more time in the field service? You may find that you can be a temporary pioneer during April. Each one can make his own analysis without making comparisons with another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The field overseer can begin preparing for this part several weeks in advance. (Your congregation may be doing fine, and new ones coming in. If so, this discussion can be adjusted in harmony with local circumstances.) The Publisher's Record cards should be posted through February. The congregation can be told that the field overseer will be at a particular location in the Kingdom Hall after the meeting and if anyone wishes to sec his Publisher’s Record card, he may do so. This may be helpful to some in reflecting on what has been accomplished and what might be done to improve their personal ministry. (If the congregation is large, he may need assistance in distributing the cards and collecting them again.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Good work is being done and the publishers should be encouraged, but as we finish up the preaching of this good news and the gathering of the remaining ones of the Lord's “sheep,&quot; we do not want to slow down. Wherever we can, we want to speed up the witness, because the time is short. 16 mln: Concluding comments. Discuss the prospects of having new ones we have been studying with to join us in the field service during April. They will particularly enjoy placing the special magazines in April. Help them to see their responsibility to share in Kingdom-preaching as they otherwise progress toward dedication and baptism. Remind publishers to turn in field service reports. Song 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Song 36. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Organization&quot; book, p. 124, par. 5, to p. 128, par. 2. Symposium by two brothers if available. First talk: &quot;Helping Interested Ones to Advance&quot; (p. 124, par, 5, to p. 125, par. 3). Second talk: &quot;Reports and Why They Are Helpful&quot; (p. 126, par. 1, to p. 128, par. 2). Emphasize the reasons for and the proper view of reporting. 15 min: “Presenting the Good News.&quot; Discuss and demonstrate suggested presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 mtn: Concluding comments. Include discussion of Question Box and announcements on page 3 that apply. Encourage temporary pioneering for April, Song 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min; Song 88. Introduction, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: “Organization&quot; book, p. 128, par. 3, to p. 132, par. 2. Talk, with audience reading some Bible texts cited. Emphasize need to impress on interested person’s mind and heart that it is part of true worship, part of the WAY of life to follow' the principles outlined in God’s Word. Vital for our worship to be acceptable to Jehovah. Information under “Reasons for Joyful Confidence” will be very encouraging if properly presented to the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Encouraging All to Attend the Lord’s Evening Meal.&quot; Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Concluding comments. Discuss what congregation was able to do in field ministry during March and plans made to make April a fine month. Song 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the Magazines Help You to Preach</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>How much can you tell a person about the Kingdom while standing on his doorstep? If you can speak with him for several minutes, this is fine. But, if you can also leave at least two magazines for reading later, think how much more is accomplished. The magazines can be “preaching” while you are busy reaching still others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Obviously, the more magazines we place, the more the magazines help us to preach. And the more time we spend in magazine distribution, the more placements will be made. Have you reviewed your personal arrangements lately for sharing in this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Do you have definite arrangements for magazine service? Leaving things to chance seldom produces as good results. You may be able regularly to support the congregation’s magazine day, and if so, this is tine. But, suppose you cannot go out on this particular day. If you took the initiative to invite others, there is a good possi-</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal is a most important occasion. It is not just another yearly meeting, nor merely a memorial of an event. Jesus said: ‘‘Keep doing this in remembrance of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">me.”</span><span class="font11"> (Luke 22:1!); 1 Cor. 11: 24) It is a calling to mind of Jesus Christ as a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">person.</span><span class="font11"> It concerns what he did and what he is now. It is a recognition that he is alive and active today, in the kingship and glory that resulted from his faithful course and sacrifice. As its Head lie is directing the affairs and activities of the Christian congregation. We are concerned with Jesus’ sacrifice and his position in God’s purpose—how these things affect us. The Lord’s Evening Meal provides opportunity to consider where we stand in Jehovah’s arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> God is highly concerned that all his Christian witnesses respect the occasion and be on hand for this observance. This fact impresses us, particularly the shepherds in the congregation, with the urgency of seeing that all who associate with the congregation lie encouraged and helped to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To this end it would be good for the elders to arrange for the brothers to reach all persons in the » congregation’s territory who are known to have some interest, or who have attended in the past. For the most part these would be persons known to the various publishers. Each book study group could survey the matter in their area and see that these persons are called on. In addition, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">subscribers could be given a special invitation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">HOW DID WE DO IN DECEMBER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There were 6,785,762 magazines placed in December, resulting in an increase in the average placed by publishers, from 11.6 a year ago to 12.4. In December we were featuring the Bible and the &quot;Word of God&quot; book. A total of 717,499 Bibles and books was placed. What a fine witness was given by distributing all this literature! And with all these placements, think of the opportunities you have for return visits and offering to study the Bible with interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There were 9,388 more publishers tills December than last December, which is good to see. But the hours were somewhat less; this continues to need our attention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What can be said to appeal to interested persons, aside from offering the printed invitations? For one thing, they may have never been inside a Kingdom Hall. Also they may not understand why they should be there, particularly if they are not members of a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. And interested ones may not see the full reason why those not having heavenly hopes should be there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Therefore it may be helpful to mention to some that they will not he expected to participate In any formalism or ritual. There is no emotional display. The Kingdom Hall serves Bible educational purposes and is accordingly not decorated with images, crosses, altars, candles, and so forth.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is suggested that the field overseer review the congregation’s arrangements for magazine distribution to see if any adjustments are advisable; also to see what can be done to encourage more to share in magazine distribution. If some cannot tit magazine service into their schedule otherwise, a portion of their regular house-to-house witnessing could be devoted to working with magazines only.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In many congregations magazine day is on Saturday, but if some have shifted their house-to-house work with the regular offer to Saturday, then Sunday might be used effectively for magazine day.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> What about additional opportunities for placing magazines? If you are alert to possibilities throughout the week, hardly a day will go by without your placing copies where they can begin to &quot;preach” instead of accumulating at home. There are friends, relatives and tradesmen who visit. You usually are going places too: to the store, to your job, to visit others.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1973 International Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The number of brothers interested in attending the conventions in Honolulu, Hawaii, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, in September and October has been overwhelming. The Society has arranged for additional charter flights, and the majority who applied have been accommodated. But these Hights are now filled, and no more planes will be chartered. The reason is that our assembly locations in Honolulu and San Juan will be more than tilled. We feel that it would not be fair to the local brothers to bring so many delegates from abroad that the local publishers could not get seats at their own assemblies. We suggest that any who are making their own travel arrangements plan to go to international assemblies in other places that will be less crowded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly in El Salvador</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In view of the earthquake in Managua and the subsequent evacuation of most of the city, there will not be an international assembly there in 1973, as was earlier planned. But arrangements are being made for an assembly for Central America nearby in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, from December 18 to 23. If you are scheduled to be on one of the Society’s tours to this area, in due time the Society’s Travel Desk will write to you about changes in travel arrangements.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Many are finding the opening articles in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> during the campaign very helpful in presenting rhe subscription offer. They are about the qualities of Jehovah, and it is just natural for us to talk about our God, is it not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> You will likely find other articles in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> that you can feature enthusiastically in presenting the subscription offer. Check each issue to see what might appeal to j&gt;eople in your territory. It is important to have some definite points in mind to talk about. These can be woven around the suggested theme of “Getting to Know God,” or another of your choice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The April 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> will be a special issue, featuring the subject &quot;How Resurrection Benefits All the Dead in Hell.” You aud many interested ones will hear this interestingly discussed in the public talk on March 25, but since it will be in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> you will be able to give this attention-getting and heart-cheering information to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How can you approach people on this subject? Well, if you find that a person believes in hellfire, or wants to know something about the subject, you could ask, “Do you think that hell will ever be done away with?” Or, when you present the article, the householder may express a fundamentalist belief in a “burning hell” or he may reply with the commonly held idea that we have our “hell here on earth.” Whatever view is expressed, you will be able to point to the Bible’s clarification on this subject of helL</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You might ask the householder if he remembers Jesus’ words that he has the “keys of death and of hell.” (Rev. 1:17, 18, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Douay)</span><span class="font11"> If Jesus opens hell, as this scripture implies, will this bring back the worst kind of people, making our earth au even more dangerous place to live? After establishing that the “hell” in this case is Hie common grave of mankind, we can point to John 5:26-29. While there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked, never again will Jehovah allow the wicked to take over this earth. True, God has mercifully arranged for billions to come forth in the resurrection. But they will be under the control of his Messianic kingdom. Rebellious ones will not be permitted to harm others. Ask the householder if he is not thrilled at the prospect of seeing loved ones lost in death brought back into such a fine world.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Encouraging All to Attend (Coat’d) Christ. It is the only day for special observance. For this reason all who believe in worship of God should be concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>0</sup> But the important thing is, Why this command? And what does the Memorial signify? Why should we want to attend? Because it has to do with our very lives. It has to do with our hope of world peace and of life in happiness in such a world. Regardless of who we are, Christ is our Purchaser and Owner by reason of his ransom sacrifice. He is our Judge. (John 5:21, 22) He is no longer a mere human, but a mighty spirit person, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Lord</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King,</span><span class="font11"> aud his government is going to have complete charge of the earth in the very near future. We are certainly concerned about the government that rules us. Where are we going to stand in the sight of our Owner, Judge aud King?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The benefits of Christ’s sacrifice will soon be applied in actually healing the diseases of all obedient persons. So all persons who believe in God should attend to get a better, deeper understanding and to know how we can receive his sacrificial benefits. In the annual observance of this occasion by Jehovah’s witnesses on the evening of April 17 this year, a speaker will explain the meaning of the Lord’s Evening Meal and its significance In our Ilves today. The Bible account at Luke 22:19, 20 is followed closely in use of the bread and wine—a simple but meaningful ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Out of love for God and his Son we will attend the Lord’s Evening Meal, and out of love for others we will aid those who may not realize its importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• When funds are needed to assist brothers in disaster areas or for special purchases requiring<sup>-</sup> more money than is presently on hand, how should the matter be handled in the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paul made known to the congrega- ** tions their privilege to minister materially in behalf of the brothers in Jerusalem when famine conditions became severe there, but, of course, he did not specify how much individuals or congregations should give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">—1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 9:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the case of a disaster, brothers in that general area, since they are in the best position to help, may individually desire to contribute funds, food, clothing and other items needed, with the eiders coordinating the efforts. If the elders of these and other congregations deem it appropriate to make a contribution, and funds in the cash account are limited, the need could be presented to the congregation. A separate contribution box might be set up for this purpose. Or, a recommendation could be presented (for approval by the congregation) that the funds received during the next few meetings in the regular contribution box, above the normal expenses, be sent to those in need through the Society’s branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If sufficient funds are not in the circuit account to pay for unexpected needs involving special purchases to be used in behalf of the circuit, the assembly overseer may explain the need to the other elders. (If a district matter cannot wait until elders for other circuits can meet at a circuit assembly, a letter containing the details may be sent to all the presiding overseers.) The elders in each congregation should discuss matters and then the proposal may be presented to the congregation for approval. They may assist according to what their circumstances permit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is thrilling to see the news that has been coming in to Brooklyn from all parts of the earth in recent weeks. Reports from the brandies indicate one new peak of publishers after another! We counted such peaks for at least fifty-three lands, along with ours, in March!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">New publisher peaks were reached in Austria, Belgium. Bolivia, British Isles, Canada, Colombia, Greece, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Finland had its third peak for the service year. Germany exceeded 91,000 publishers (91,068). Italy had an 18.1-percent increase over last year’s average: the Netherlands, with their fifth peak of tlie year, reached 11.4 percent : Spain, 19 percent, with 18,722 publishers. Other examples are I Ivory Coast, 18 percent: Korea, 16.2 percent, and Puerto Rico, 14 percent. Japan, with a 24-percent increase, reported 16,274 publishers, and their 68th month of consecutive publisher peaks! As the end draws near, Jehovah is indeed ‘speeding up' the increase!—Isa. 60 : 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Along with these peaks in number of publishers, many of these lands averaged 11 hours or more. Italy averaged 13.6, and Peru, 16.1 hours. Love for Jehovah should move all of us to exert ourselves, whole-souled in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work is not slowing down. It is on the increase in ever so many lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “Divine Victory” International Assemblies will soon begin. They should do much to strengthen all of us for what lies ahead in the grand work that God has given us to do. We hear that 480 missionaries plan to attend assemblies in the U.S. Also large delegations plan to come to assemblies here from England, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries. We have a blessed spiritual feast ahead of us. Don’t miss any of it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We send you our warm love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brothers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Readily Sharing Our Hope </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Peak of 446,311 Publishers Share</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How delighted we were to see 446,311 sharing in the field ministry in March ! This is 9,852 more than our previous all-time publisher peak in February, and an Increase of exactly 22,000 publishers over last March. And what fine enthusiasm was shown for the Ixtrd’s work! Over a million hours more were devoted to the field ministry this March than a year ago. And 1,863,718 more magazines were placed and over 100,000 more return visits were made than in March 1972. What fine evidence this is of our confidence in the marvelous hope that God has given us and of our readiness to share it with our fellowman!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During June all of us will have splendid opportunities to demonstrate our readiness to share with others the source of our hope. We will be offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher</span><span class="font11"> on a contribution of $1.25. The Bible can </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Im?</span><span class="font11"> featured whenever possible, but if persons say they have a Bible and are not interested in obtaining another one, you can offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher </span><span class="font11">book alone. Its simplicity of expression and yet depth of thought will appeal to many adults and children alike.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As for sermon suggestions in connection with the offer, you may want to use John 17:17 and John 8:32 in combination or singly as the circumstances dictate. If a warm, friendly greeting is exchanged and some comment is made about the great need to hear the truth, as well as to speak the truth, it may be possible to read and perhaps discuss briefly either one or both of these scriptures. The majority of us have offered the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> before, and we may have found a particularly successful presentation that we want to use. In this connection, one sister from New York State wrote recently about what she found effective:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> “After giving the sermon, when offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation, </span><span class="font11">1 would ask the householder, ‘How much do you think a person can get a Bible like this for?’ They would say $5.09 to $10.00. Even if they would reply that they didn’t know, 1 would tell them what others had said. When I told them that they could have a copy for only $1.00, you could see the amazement on their faces. Many said right away: ‘I’ll take it.’ ‘How do you do it?’ And this would then provide opportunity to explain our Bible study program and the printing operation of the Society.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> To help each one of us to feature God’s Word in our field ministry, the Society has provided something special. It is a four-page folder that nicely describes the Bibles that we have available for the public, as well as a few of our Bible study aids. No doubt you have received your copy of this folder and have had opportunity to examine it. Only one per publisher is being provided: it is for your individual use. Please keep in mind that there will be no replacement, so take good care of yours. You may want to enclose it in some sort of protective covering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Obviously, we cannot carry with us samples of all the Bibles and Bible study aids we have to offer. But we can show this folder, and a person can pick the publication he desires and we can bring it to him. Display it freely. Many honest-hearted ones may want the large-print </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Neto World Translation,</span><span class="font11"> available for $5.00, or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Interlinear Translation</span><span class="font11"> for $2.00. There are also many other English as well as foreign Bible translations that can be obtained from the Society. And if people say they do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Chairman: Brief introduction to material should include some comments on displaying genuine love and Christian hospitality toward one another at assemblies this summer. What we do, how we act, can be a powerful influence for good or can cause disappointment, even stumbling some. After very brief introductory comments proceed to ask the following questions, letting brothers look up scriptures, commenting on them and applying them to our conduct at Christian assemblies. (1) What do Christian assemblies provide for us in these momentous days? (Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10:24. 25) (2) What quality primarily should we display if we are to be identified as Christ’s disciples? Why do you so answer? (John 13:34, 35) (3) How do Bible principles show that we should conduct ourselves with respect to waiting in line for food or for releases at a literature counter? (1 Cor. 10:24; John 15:12, 13) (4) When it comes to seat saving, what Bible principles should guide our outlook and decisions? (Heb. 13:1, 2; Phil. 2:3, 4; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Col. 3:13) (5) What would we do if newly Interested ones came to our house to learn about the Bible and the entire family was seated, occupying all the chairs at the table? Would we just tell them that they would have to stand, or would some of us help them to be seated? (Rom. 12:10; 1 Pet. 4:9) (6) How can we aid elderly people to enjoy assemblies? How can children make the assembly more enjoyable for their parents? (Lev. 19:32; Ex. 20:12) (7) Why is setting a good example at assemblies of great value to fellow believers, new ones and worldly observers? (1 Pet. 2:12; 2 Cor. 6:3, 4)</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are We Missing Any Opportunities?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Arc we missing any opportunities to do what? To start Bible studies! As we work our territory more often, there is a need to exercise even greater discernment in speaking with those we meet. No matter in what feature of the field ministry we may be engaged, it is good to be ready to adapt our presentation so as to start a study then and there.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When one sister observed that a householder was showing more than the usual Interest in the good news, she adjusted her presentation and explained our free Bible study program. The householder was surprised and asked, “Do you mean I get another chance?” She then explained that someone had called on her several years earlier and she had refused to study at that time because she was pregnant. This time the study was started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When a householder already has our literature, has friends or relatives who are Jehovah’s witnesses, and as a result has some interest in our work, often a study can be started on the first call. In fact, if the person has one of our publications, why not simply suggest he locate it and then show him how easily he can learn about Jehovah and his purposes. Arrangements can be made to call back later and continue the discussion. You may decide whether It would be best to mention “our Bible study program” at that time or to wait until the study is under way.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> One publisher met a man who had relatives who were becoming interested in our work and, after getting acquainted with the situation, the publisher answered a few questions and started a study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> hook, which the man had obtained already. It was not necessary to offer any literature, only the Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Whether in magazine work, using the regular offer in house-to-house work, or witnessing on the street; seize every opportunity to start a study immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Readily Sharing Our Hope </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font11">not want a Bible, we can show them the folder’s description of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,”</span><span class="font11"> which they may be interested in obtaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> What should we do if, in our field ministry, we come to a clergyman’s house? Should we pass it by? No. Some of those men too have accepted the truth. You might show him the special folder, pointing out one of the Bible translations that you think he would enjoy, or perhaps </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid to Bible Understanding </span><span class="font11">or the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">lx the Bible Keally the </span><span class="font11">Word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of Godf</span><span class="font11"> These are excellent publications, and he may want one of them. (Acts 6:7) Clearly, we do not want to overlook anyone in our public ministry.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Should Be Done?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What should be done when an elder or a ministerial servant moves to another congregation and the body of elders there wants to use him as an elder or a ministerial servant? The governing body has asked that the entire body of elders in the congregation to which he moves make inquiry of the entire body of elders where he was appointed and had served. In other words, it is not merely a matter of the current committee making the recommendation, but the entire body of elders should make the recommendation. The recommendation can be sent in by the committee, but the full body of elders is to be consulted and should register its approval of the brother being recommended as an elder or a ministerial servant in their congregation. They should await a letter from the governing body making the appointment before any announcement is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">- If</span><span class="font11"> someone serving as an elder or a ministerial servant commits a serious wrong and is put under restrictions by the judicial committee he is no longer irreprehensible or free from accusation and thus he loses his privileges and his status as an elder. (1 Tim. 3:2, 10; Titus 1:6, 7) This, of course, is announced to the congregation, and q the notification of this should be • sent to the branch office so that the records there can be adjusted accordingly. (Pages 157, 158, 170, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font11"> book.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> However, what should be done when there is a question regarding the brother’s qualifications and the body of elders decides to recommend one’s removal as an elder or a ministerial servant? The body of elders should discuss matters thoroughly with the one whose qualifications are in question, decide what they are going to recommend to the governing body, and furnish briefly the reasons for their recommendation and the facts on which their decision was based. They should, however, await notification from the governing body as to whether this brother is being retained or deleted before making any announcement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In every ease where an appointed elder or a ministerial servant moves or is disqualified for some reason, the governing body should be notified. If you know to where he has moved, please advise the Society, as this information is very helpful. If the brother was serving on the committee, then let the Society’s office know who will be caring for the position on the committee.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Challenging, Yet Rewarding, Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some have asked for more details in connection with working business territory. We are pleased to offer some suggestions, which we hope will help you to meet the great challenge that is represented in the vast amount of unworked business territory in some areas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To get business territory worked on an organized basis, it is recommended that the city overseer, with the cooperation of the presiding overseers and circuit overseers (for these areas), make up a list of names of pioneers and publishers who waut to work business territory and who likely would he successful therein. We all appreciate that, as pointed out at 1 Corinthians 12:5, “There are varieties of ministries.” Some, because of background and experience, would be more effective than others in this “ministry.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In preparation for this activity a special meeting may be arranged with all those selected to work business territory. A few weeks prior to this meeting it would be advantageous to have several qualified brothers and sisters work in tiie main business district, giving preference to some of the larger office buildings. A review of the March 1971 and May 1973 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> will aid them. In New York city some of the circuit overseers and a district overseer spent several days working a sampling of business territory, concentrating mainly on the large office buildings. Periodically, they exchanged Ideas on approaches that proved effective, made notes of problems encountered and how these were handled, as well as experiences they had. This experience proved valuable in connection with a meeting to launch this program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> For the special meeting to set this program in motion, a program could be worked up under the direction of tiie city overseer. Those who initially worked business territory can relate experiences, realistically fea ture demonstrations, discuss ways of approaching business and professional people that met with success and talking points that appealed to persons in this type of territory. Thereafter, any questions that the publishers and pioneers have can be handled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Prior to this meeting the various congregations that hold business territory not being worked will, through their field overseers, have worked up territory maps for the business territory, making them available after this meeting, and these territories can be checked out before the brothers leave the meeting. Thereafter, an arrangement can be worked out locally so that territories can be systematically and appropriately checked in and out. It is hoped that this territory will be worked at least once a year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We might add that the experiences of the brothers here in New York city have shown generally that it is not advisable to try to talk to everyone in an office or to every individual in a certain building. In many cases it is best to ask for particular individuals where their names appear listed in directories in the lobby, on individual floors oi- on the doors leading to their offices. Sometimes, one might find it necessary to ask for the office manager. If referred to a person in charge, it is proper that he be approached with the message. In a tactful, straightforward way explain what you are doing. Then offer the subscription or other </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on. page 4, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Right Approach</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Personal motivation and an effective approach are important aspects of a house-to-house presentation. It is important to keep clearly in mind our desire to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, also our deep concern for our fellowmen. It is also good to analyze our approach from time to time and determine whether we impart the kind of information that will capture and hold the householder’s interest from the beginning of our presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Wo might ask ourselves, “If I do not gain a hearing ear, is it because of the householder or because of my approach?” In some territories, when an introduction is too general, the householder may quickly excuse himself without ever really bearing the Kingdom message. What can we do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> No doubt we could profitably put forth greater effort to get into the subject of our presentation early in the introduction. For example, after briefly introducing ourselves, we might mention some local or world problem and ask If they know a remedy. Or, if you feel that your territory requires an even more direct approach, you might begin by asking, &quot;What can we do</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Challenging Territory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">literature, depending upon the circumstances, time available and other factors. In large firms it may be possible to get permission to talk to other officials or key men. It is good to have your identification card available should it be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Much literature has been placed already here in New York city by those working business territory. For example, one brother working several hours placed 80 magazines and 20 books in that short ]&gt;eriod of time. Those who have been contacting the business people find that they are generally courteous, and usually our brothers are well received. Since these people are knowledgeable. good discussions often result. Where persons are very busy at first, but suggest that an appointment be made (or the publisher may ask for one), it is recommended that you arrange for a later visit. This has been done with good results. Also, return visits have alto upgrade the quality of life today?” Then when you have their attention and interest, use the Bible to show how the Kingdom will solve man’s problems. No matter what the subject of our presentation, it is beneficial to have an introduction that quickly gets into the subject and arouses interest in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The same principle applies when engaging in magazine work. It is usually more effective to feature a specific article rather than just holding </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">up to the householder’s view and offering them for ten cents. Apart from special issues, the covers on the magazines reflect little change —but their contents do, every issue. So if we draw attention to a title and say something about the article that will quickly show its value, the householder may take them even if he has refused them before. If he is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">interested</span><span class="font11"> in an article he will not only accept the magazine, but read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When engaging in the field ministry, keep in mind that the message is the Important thing. If we can get into our subject rather quickly, then people will have an opportunity to accept or reject the Kingdom message, rather than turn-I ing us away without really knowing I wliy we are there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> By setting things in motion in the above-mentioned manner, such a program will assure that the challenge of the business territory will be met. If this work cannot be started before the assemblies this summer, then city overseers can organize this activity right after the assembly.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> In addition to downtown business areas, there are outlying business sections that need to be covered, and even in small towns there are business places that are sometimes left unworked by publishers. All publishers can work in small towns covering the business sections.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> It is Jehovah’s will that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

<p><span class="font9">• Are there any circumstances under which ministerial servants may be used to give public talks outside their own congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the elders upon whom the Scriptures place the responsibility to do “speaking and teaching” in the congregations. (1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2) Wherever possible, they should give the public talks. If there are not enough elders available, even with an exchanging of speakers between congregations, the body of elders may assign certain ministerial servants to give public talks (or, possibly, to handle part of a symposium) in their home congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under normal circumstances, only elders would be assigned to give public talks in congregations other than their own. But if there simply are not enough elders available in the area, then, In order to keep the public meetings going on a regular basis, ministerial servants may be requested from nearby congregations to give public talks. If a request is received by the presiding overseer for the services of ministerial servants and the local body of elders feels that they will handle the assignment well, they may be assigned to speak in that other congregation. However, unless ministerial servants are specifically requested as speakers, only elders should be sent out to other congregations to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Where it is not possible to arrange for public speakers at. all on certain weeks, then it is suggested that the material in the extensive outlines provided by the Society be read to the congregation and they can look up and discuss the scriptures together. (Do not order handbills for such presentations.) In this way, whether public speakers are available or not, all will receive the spiritual food provided by means of the public meeting program.</span></p>

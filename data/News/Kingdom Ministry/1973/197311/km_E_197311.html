<p><span class="font10">On every hand there is evidence of an upsurge of interest in the truth and increased participation in the field ministry on the part of Jehovah’s people. What a pleasure it is for us here at Bethel to receive reports of this from the field I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reports submitted by presiding overseers indicate that meeting attendance in many congregations is 22 percent more than the number of publishers. One congregation with 161 publishers averages 228 for its public talks; another, with 147 publishers, has 234 at its meetings. And for the service year that ended in August, here in the United States there were 55,775 baptized, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year. Just as Isaiah long ago foretold, now, in &quot;the final part of the days,” many people are joining us in ‘going up •y to the house of Jehovah’ to be instructed in his ways.—Isa. 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As more persons become convinced that God’s kingdom of a thousand years is close they feel impelled to tell others about it. What lias been the result? During August there was a new peak of 472,662 publishers in the field. That is 54,269 more than the number reporting last August, and a 13-per-cent increase over last year’s average. Isn’t that grand? These publishers, whether new or experienced, do not share the world’s view that ‘God is slow,’ but they see that his patience affords opportunity for repentance. Appreciating it themselves, they are urging others to do the same. (2 Pet. 3:9) During this same month they spent 7,964,141 hours in sharing the good news with others, nearly 2 million hours more than were reported last August. Magazine placements went up more than 2 million. Return visits and Bible studies also showed fine increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Stimulated by an awareness that Divine Victory over this wicked system is near, many more are buying out the time to pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When you received your personal copy of the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Tears Has Approached</span><span class="font10"> and looked at the table of contents, how could you avoid being impelled to begin reading! And as you read, your faith was built up wonderfully. The book gives one a visionary preview of the thousandyear rule of God’s kingdom, the words painting such a clear picture that One can easily visualize many marvelous things connected with the Kingdom reign. Here we are at the threshold of the ihousand-year reign, and how grateful we are that Jehovah has provided us with so many details concerning the Millennium and what will take place during that time!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> At the end of the first chapter we read: “What those thousand years usher in upon our earth is something vitally necessary to the endless life and happiness of the world of mankind. How, then, can we reasonably hold back from at once examining closely the prophetic picture of the marvelous millennium that the apostle John so beautifully drew for us?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Then we had great pleasure in During August, 17,484 were temporary pioneers, which is unusually high. Others planned to do it in September in order to share fully in distributing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Neies</span><span class="font10"> No. 16. And no doubt many will do it again in December when we take </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 17 to the people. Will yon?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">We keenly anticipate the Divine Victory that lies ahead. May we prove our faith in it now by firmness in our integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To all of you we send our warm Christ ian love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your fellow servants, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn Branch Office </span><span class="font10">examining the prophetic picture of the Millennium. The book directed our attention to the Scriptures, which let us look even beyond the Millennium, so we are able to see more than a thousand years into the future and know what we will experience if we prove our faith by firmness in our integrity to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Prove Our Faith by Firmness in Our Integrity.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> After reading the first nine chapters, our appetites were stimulated to read on as the opening words of chapter 10 said: “When we look at it according to what the Bible says about it, the Millennium is a thing very much to be desired for all mankind, the living and the dead. That is why the announcement that it has approached is most welcome news for all who understand. We ought to be excitedly interested in knowing what valid reasons we have for being convinced that it has approached.” Then we were treated to a view of the events taking place now and immediately ahead of us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Our preview of the thousandyear reign should move us to want others to have this same visionary preview. The month of November gives us a golden opportunity to thrill many others with a vision of God's kingdom of a thousand years. (Matt. 10:27) Some of the points mentioned above can be used by us as wo work among the people with this new book. People of Christendom have for centuries prayed for God’s kingdom to come. Now we can show them that It has approached, what it will really mean for them and the great blessings in store for those who prove to be integrity keepers. It is no longer a case of praying and not knowing when the Kingdom would come, but now the Millennial rule has approached and the time re-</span></p>

So our follow-up on each placement of the book is very important. There are many appetizing points that can be discussed. Surely good people will want to know that there will be one human race, one language, international peacefulness, and what the rulers will be like; that there will not be immediate perfection but there will be no evil influence of Satan and the demons around; when the resurrection will occur, etc. These are but a few of the wonderful things the Bible reveals about the Millennium. Some may want more proof or information about the sign of Christ’s presence, and we have all these points to refer to in the book.

Surely we all are interested In what kind of government it will be, and the Bible tells us much about it.

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Can You, Too, Share in the Joy of Disciple-making?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font11">ESUS commanded his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.” In 208 lands and islands throughout the earth today, over one and a half million praisers of Jehovah God are living testimony to the fulfillment of this commission of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is a special joy associated with making disciples. The apostle Paul wrote of this joy to a congregation he worked to establish in Thessalonica, Macedonia: “For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you? . . . You certainly are our glory and joy.” (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) It is especially exhilarating to observe the happiness of sheeplike ones as they come to appreciate basic truths about Jehovah God and his purpose. Can you, too, share in that joy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In modern times Bible studies have been the most effective means of making disciples. But some publishers may think that the Bible study work is not for them. Why? Possibly some feel unqualified due to old age, sickness or lack of secular education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Others have worked hard for some time in the field ministry but have not been successful in starting studies. Many have discontinued unproductive studies after six months and have been unable to find replacements. Is there some way for these brothers and sisters to share in the joy of making disciples through Bible studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">How Much Do You Want a Bible Study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Success in the Bible study work is closely related to how much one really wants to share in it. Do you have a deep desire to teach someone the truth? Have you made it a matter of regular prayer? Have you exerted extra effort in harmony with your prayer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit overseer relates the experience of a sixteen-year-old girl who did so: “This young girl really wanted a Bible study and so she prayed to Jehovah, asking his direction upon her efforts. Then she opened the telephone book to the letter “A” and began calling people. She would introduce herself and say: ‘I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses offering free Bible studies to people.’ Many calls were made without success. But she did not give up. Then a woman was contacted who replied: ‘I would love to have a Bible study.’ How interesting, too, to learn that this woman lived in a building in which Jehovah’s witnesses had not been able to preach!” Is your desire to obtain a Bible study as strong as that? If you make it a matter of prayer and work at it, Jehovah will surely bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Studies Be Started?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many ways to start Bible studies. In some areas this can be accomplished on the first call by a direct offer to aid the householder to understand the Bible. This is especially so where people have a reverence for the Word of God. But in other places brothers may find it necessary to break down barriers such as prejudice, false doctrines or indifference. In cases like these, several Scriptural discussions may be necessary before a study can be established. You yourself are the best one to decide which approach to use in a particular situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Where you discern interest, be careful not to let it cool off by waiting too long before calling again. There is no Scriptural requirement to wait a week or two before returning to visit an interested person. Some publishers arrange for a return visit </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the very same day </span><span class="font11">where unusual interest is detected. Others call again within the week of the initial contact and report excellent results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Have you noticed that in some places our brothers work the territory over and over but few studies are started? Why is this so? Is it that the people simply are not interested in the truth? Of course, this is possible. But could it be that what the brothers are saying to the people does not arouse their interest? If you are to be successful in starting Bible studies you must </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">find out what the people are interested in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In some areas people do not respond to discussions of Bible doctrine. But frequently these people are disturbed about the dishonesty, immorality and lack of neighbor love in the world today. Would people in your territory who seem uninterested in Bible doctrine respond to a discussion of such matters that definitely are on their minds? We have just what they need in the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—From What Source?</span><span class="font11"> Direct their attention to chapter 10, 12 or 13, or read to them the opening paragraph of chapter 14 or chapter 15. Perhaps this will open the way for a fine study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Or is it war, food shortage, pollution, disease or crime that disturbs them? The first two chapters of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font11"> book are ideal for discussions with such persons. Just select an appropriate section and start reading it to them. The reasonableness of the presentation may move them to realize that, really, this is exactly what they have been looking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit overseer’ in New York observed: “People in the world frequently view Bible study as something dull and uninteresting. Our brothers must avoid making their presentations too general, simply mentioning the Bible or Bible study. They need to show people something specific.” How can this be done? This brother explains his own approach: “After introducing myself I often say: 'We are asking a question of our neighbor’s today: Why do you think God allows innocent people to suffer?’ ” Then he directs their attention to chapter 8 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font11">book. What subject would arouse people’s interest in your territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One good way to find out what people are interested in is to listen carefully to what they say. True, a person may bring up a subject completely different from your prepared presentation. But, instead of pressing forward with a matter that does not interest him, would it not be better to direct him to a section in one of the Society’s publications that deals with what he is interested in?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another effective method is to show the householder the table of contents in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Peace and Security</span><span class="font11"> book. Then ask: “Which of these subjects would you like to learn more about?” One circuit overseer in New York says that in his. territory people often pick the subjects “Why We Grow Old and Die,” “Why Has God Permitted Wickedness Until Our Day?”, and “How to Pray and Be Heard by God.” Would these subjects be effective in your territory? If not, which ones would?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is it always necessary to conduct studies in a printed Bible study aid? Not at all. In fact, with some individuals it may be advantageous to use only the Bible for a period of time. A missionary tells of the experience of a sister in Niigata, Japan:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“A </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book was placed with a woman but on the return visit she did not invite the publisher in. She had read some of the book and noticed that it did not harmonize with the Catholic religion.” Did this sister give up hope of starting a study there? The missionary continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The sister suggested using only the Bible, and the woman agreed. These discussions went on for four months. Sometimes up to fifty scriptures would be used in one sitting. When this woman was convinced that she was learning the truth, the sister pointed out that she had gotten most of her material from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font11"> book. Thereafter this interested person agreed to the use of printed publications. Soon she got rid of her Catholic images and began attending meetings. Then she wrote to her priest to have her name removed from the church roll.” This woman is now a Kingdom publisher with two Bible studies of her own and hopes to bo baptized in the near future. Are there people in your territory who would be willing to discuss the Bible with you even though they refuse the offei’ of literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Search Out Every Possibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In most countries the house-to-house ministry is the principal way interested people are contacted. But there are many other ways of obtaining Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The place to look for an interested person may be in the household of someone who is already studying. Unbelieving mates will often respond favorably if approached in a friendly way. A missionary in Morocco tells of his visit to the home of a woman with whom his wife was conducting a Bible study:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Previously her husband had shown no interest at all in the study. I began talking to him about his automobile and we became friendly. Then he mentioned that he would like to learn the French language. I explained that the English and French editions of our book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font11"> go nearly page for page. I suggested that we study French together with the aid of this book. He accepted and we began a Bible study. Later he gave up on French but not on the truth. He and his two children are now Kingdom publishers and his wife is a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A district overseer for the United States tells of a pioneer couple in Concord, New Hampshire, who concentrated their efforts on unbelieving husbands. This helped them to achieve a total of twenty-six Bible studies between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Asking persons with whom you study for suggestions as to others who might be interested is another fine way of obtaining Bible studies. A circuit overseer relates the following experience of a sister in Massachusetts: “The sister started a study and out of this four additional studies were started which she turned over to other publishers. From these five studies twenty people are now serving Jehovah. Then the same sistei' started another study. After a while she encouraged the interested person to invite others. This, too, resulted in an additional four studies. On my last visit to that congregation twenty-six people were attending meetings from this last group of studies.” Thus through referrals two studies grew to ten and forty-six people got started on the road to everlasting life. Have you explored this avenue of finding Bible studies? Why not try it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those who have limited education and who may not read well can also be developed into fine Bible studies. These people may refuse offers of literature. But does this mean that they are not interested in the truth? Not necessarily. Often these persons have keen minds and are hungering for truth. Would you be willing to call on someone like that each week and read to him from the Bible or from a Bible study aid? Many zealous publishers learned the truth without being able to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What about children? Youngsters are usually eager to learn and delight to have someone teach them about God. In New England a seven-year-old girl spoke about Bible truth to another little girl of the same age. The girl became interested and asked her parents for permission to study, but they refused. So the little girl went to her friend’s house and asked if she could live there. It was explained that being one of Jehovah’s witnesses would mean giving up the celebration of birthdays and holidays and things like these. But she replied: “I don’t care. Living in paradise is more important.” Of course, this young girl continued to live in her own home, but she would visit the Witness family each week to obtain Bible articles written especially for children. Her desire to learn about Jehovah God was so strong that she would read these articles instead of playing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Older people and those infirm or handicapped are another field where Bible studies may be cultivated. They are often pleased to have someone call on them to discuss the Word of God. A circuit overseer tells of two sisters in New York who made a special effort to study with elderly and infirm people: “One of them began by offering magazines to patients in a nursing home. She now conducts several studies there. The other sister points to a building housing senior citizens and says: ‘That’s my territory.’ She visits these oldei’ people and studies with them to the extent possible, even teaching some of them to read.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">When and Where Can</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Studies Be Conducted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When you make return visits on interested people do you find they are seldom at home? Today’s high costs and the fast pace at which people live often keep them away from home for long hours each day. But some publishers have gone out of their way to share in the joy of conducting Bible studies with such people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Florida, for example, there is a sister who got out of bed and went to conduct a study with an interested couple each week at 3:30 a.m. because this was the only convenient time for that couple to study. An overseer from the Netherlands tells of a brother in Amsterdam who studied with a dance instructor weekly between two and four in the morning. This man eventually sold his dancing establishment and entered the pioneer ministry. He now serves as an elder in his congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Perhaps you cannot study with a certain person in his home. But could the study go on somewhere else? Many Bible studies are held in Kingdom Halls, in automobiles or in places of business. An overseei’ from South Africa says that there many brothers conduct studies at work during lunch hour because the interested persons live far away from the brothers’ homes. A brother who is now a missionary tells of conducting a study in New York in a subway change booth. A circuit overseer started a study with a New York taxi driver, but they were not able to get together at a central location. What did they do? The brother explains: “Somehow we managed to study regularly. We held our study in his home, in his taxi, at the Kingdom Hall, in restaurants, in the park and in my home.” Now this interested man attends all meetings, has joined the Theocratic Ministry School and plans to be baptized soon. Would it be possible for you, too, to conduct a Bible study at an unusual time or place? Are you willing to make the necessary adjustments in your schedule to share in such a joy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Do You Feel Unable to Conduct Studies?</span><span class="font11"> i</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you feel ill-equipped to conduct Bible studies for some reason? Some might feel that, because their secular education is very limited, the Bible study work is not for them. But is this necessarily true? Consider the experience of a brother from Guadaloupe who could neither read nor write. The branch overseer in that country relates: “This brother met a man from door to door and placed a book with him. When he made the return visit he did not mention that he could not read. Instead he encouraged the man to get his book. He would have the man read the paragraphs and then the questions. Then he would ask: 'Could you give me the answer to the question you just read?’ In this way the man progressed to the point of meeting attendance and now shares in the field ministry.” Others with limited education take another publisher along with them to help them to conduct their Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is it sickness or some physical handicap that keeps you from sharing in the joy of conducting Bible studies? A circuit overseer from Massachusetts observed: “Often the/ ones conducting studies are those that are older or infirm, not the younger, healthy ones.” An example is a special pioneer in the Netherlands who became crippled for ten years. Did this keep her from teaching the truth to others? An overseer acquainted with her points out: “During all of that time this sister continued in full-time service as a regular pioneer. She would conduct studies by her bedside. In fact, she had such capabilities in this feature of the service that other publishers would bring their interested persons to her. This sister has aided scores of people to the point of dedication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is it your heart’s desire to share in the joy of making disciples? Then make it a matter of prayer and explore every way open to you of obtaining a Bible study. Remember, success in the Bible study work does not depend on natural ability or worldly educational status. No, but “our being adequately qualified issues from God.”—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Missing the Purpose of Our Field Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Today, more and more we find people who do not listen to our message or take any literature but yet say: “My religious organization is doing the same thing,” or “You are doing a fine work. May God bless you.” We may have found ourselves going to the next door with the feeling that we merely left them in a good frame of mind for the next Witness. But we must remember that one day we may be making the last call on these people. Will our next call be the last one? What, then, should we do and say under these circumstances? —2 Cor. 6:2; Isa. 55: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Is not our purpose to give a witness about the Kingdom, and are we not convinced that we are doing a work that no other religious organization is doing? So if these people just agree with us or merely say that the Bible is a good book and should be read more, and this is all we establish at the door, have we missed the purpose of our call? When we read the life history of Jesus, what do we find? He did not allow soft words and flattery to sway him from accomplishing his purpose. For example, on one occasion certain religious persons said to him, “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach ihe way of God in truth, and you do not care for anybody, for you do not look upon men’s outward appearance.” This disarming approach did not cause him to miss the purpose of his ministry. He took the initiative and gave a witness about the truth so effectively that they marveled at what he said. —Matt. 22:15-22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’During the month of November we offer to the people the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font10">book. You may try different ways of arousing interest in the book and see what is effective in your territory. An approach that may be successful is to ask a parent at the door: “If your child who has learned the Lord's prayer from you were to ask, ‘What is the Kingdom?’ could you answer him intelligently? Or, the child might ask, ‘When is the Kingdom going to come?’ What would you say?” Then you might explain that to make this prayer mean more than just words, he can get real answers concerning the Kingdom in this publication. (Page 191, paragraph 14)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Some individuals may be very satisfied with their religion, but we could frankly ask them if their religion has taught them how to obey the Bible command in Revelation 18:4. We could read the scripture if permitted or, if not, tell them what it says. Since they are satisfied with their religion and do not know what Babylon is and how to come out of it, we could tell them that because it is so urgent and they have not yet received this vital information we would like to leave this book with them to help them to find out how to obey this commandment. (Page 202 has good pointed information on Rev. 18:4.) It may be good not to tell them on this first call what Babylon the Great is; give them a chance to see if they can find out. When you return, you could take the discussion from that point. Their waiting a short period for the answer that they could not Scripturally get from their church may impress on them their need for something outside their religion.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> To those who feel that all religious organizations are doing the same thing we might say: “No one other than Jehovah’s witnesses has ever called at my door with this message. How about you? Do you know what message God’s people were commanded to take to the people?” You might then refer to Matthew 24:14 on page 307. Interest might be cultivated in the book by using the good talking points on pages 306 and 307.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In making return visits it Is always good to keep in mind our goal of giving a witness. If the person previously witnessed to is not home, then how about the person </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for December 22-31</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 17 will be distributed from December 22 to 31. Supplies are being consigned to all congregations. If you have territory that was not worked with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News No.</span><span class="font10"> 16, then plan to work that territory first when distributing No. 17. [If your congregation received more tracts last time than could be distributed in your territory, please inform us how many your congregation can use and we will consign that number of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 17.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you have a Spanish section and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">there is no Spanish congregation working it,</span><span class="font10"> you may send in an order for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 17 in Spanish and they will be sent to you. Specify how many you need. We are not in a position to supply </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> in other languages. Send orders for Spanish tracts </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">now </span><span class="font10">and these will be shipped to you with your next shipment of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">who has answered the knock? It is very easy to say: “Mr.---- and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I had an interesting conversation on my last call and no doubt you likewise would be pleased to hear about a unique government—the thousand-year government.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We may be inclined to feel that some of these approaches are too direct and straightforward, but we can be assured that speaking the truth plainly but tactfully will not drive sheeplike ones away. Did not Jesus say concerning the true shepherd: “The sheep follow him, because they know his voice.”? —John 10: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Tobacco Users</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It will soon be about six months since </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> in English pointed out the need for decisive action in stopping use of tobacco by dedicated persons. If there are still any who use tobacco, it would lie good for them to make stronger efforts to stop now. Speak to the elders for assistance. The elders, applying the counsel of the Scriptures, must determine who may remain in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Nonbaptized persons who use tobacco and simply attend meetings, without advocating the use of it or trying to involve the brothers in such practice, may be permitted to continue attending meetings, but they should not use tobacco at the Kingdom Hall. However, where individuals who are not baptized have associated in the sense of sharing in the field ministry and the Theocratic Ministry School, they should have been talked to by this time and if, within the same period of six months, they have not broken the habit, they should be told that they are not acceptable to share in the field service or the Theocratic Ministry School, if this has not already been done. They should be encouraged to inform the elders when they have completely ended tobacco use. But no further action will be taken, since they are not baptized. They may attend meetings. It would not be necessary to make a public announcement concerning these unbaptized persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If a tobacco user was once baptized but left the organization a long time ago and does not now claim to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses and his use of tobacco causes no reproach or disturbance in the congregation, it would not be necessary for the elders to search him out and inquire whether he is using tobacco or to take action against such a smoker who no longer associates.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With the New Book “True Peace and Security —From What Source?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The book contains not only a wonderful and encouraging message, but many other features that will help us to place it in the hands of the people. This new book is really styled for use in the Kingdom field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The title itself gives us opportunities to make a presentation. When approaching someone, we might ask questions, such as: “Do you think the people of the world feel secure these days? How do you feel about your own situation?” There are many current events that cause people to think about their security. Perhaps in one community it will lie a flood or other disaster, an earthquake or a storm; unemployment may be widespread ; there may be robberies in the neighborhood, or assaults and murders that are widely publicized in the press. Children may be molested. All of these things will cause people to think about personal security. So we can ask appropriate questions according to what is likely to be on the minds of the people, then point to the title of the book and show them the table of contents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Or. one might consider the bad conditions in the world and raise questions about what all this means. Then introduce the book and open it to pages 82 and 83 and use those two pages as the basis for interesting conversation and placement of the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Many of the chapters have very fine opening paragraphs for use in arousing interest in the book. We might open to the first two paragraphs in chapter 1 and read them and then direct attention to the picture, which shows people living in peace and security.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> For other people In your territory you may find special interest in certain subjects. The first two paragraphs of chapter 2 raise some very thought-provoking questions that may appeal to certain people. For others you may find the words of chapter 5, the first paragraph, just right to stimulate interest in the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Those interested in religion may be aroused to want to read the book by our considering with them the first paragraph of chapter 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> You may find some concerned about the buildup of armaments and nuclear testing and the everpresent possibility of nuclear war. The first paragraph of chapter 8 can be put to good use among such people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Hope for the future Is aroused in the first two paragraphs of chapter 0, stimulating the reader to want to see how true [&gt;eace and security will come.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>0</sup> For a quick presentation one might show the title of the book, and then turn to the statement printed in bold type at the top of page two, the message from “The Publishers,” thus giving people reason to want to have and read the book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> These are examples of things that can be taken from the book and used in presenting it, and there are many more. Each Kingdom publisher can choose what suits him. Scripture texts can be read right from the book. If desired, two points could be combined to deal with a particular territory or situation. Some publishers may. want to try various presentations in their territory and see which works the best In arousing the interest of the people in that community in reading the book. For example, there are many points in chapter 2 that can be used in talking to people familiar with current events. In December we will try to place this new book and the Bible together, emphasizing the fact that the Bible contains the answers. However, since many people have a Bible and do not wish to get another, we can place the book by itself. Select a way of presenting the good news that will get results in your territory.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Who may perform weddings and funerals?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Weddings and funerals may be conducted by any dedicated, baptized brother as permitted by law. If there are any restrictions or requirements according to the local law, these should be carefully observed. When it comes to the selection of someone to conduct a wedding or a funeral, this is a personal matter for the individuals or the family involved to determine. Since weddings and funerals are not viewed as public talks, appointment as an elder or ministerial servant Is not a requirement for one to perform such services. If it is to be in the Kingdom Hall, then, of course, permission must be obtained from the congregation service committee. A dedicated brother from a different congregation could be allowed to give a wedding or funeral talk in another congregation’s Kingdom Hall with the approval of the committee and in accord with the local laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dedicated couples in good standing in the congregation may be permitted by the committee to use the Kingdom Hall for a wedding. A dedicated person who plans to marry an undedicated person should be counseled concerning marrying “only in the Lord.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:39) If the dedicated one goes through with the marriage, it is his responsibility. The committee may or may not decide to allow the use of the Hall, but, even if allowed, this does not mean that they approve of the marriage. Two undedicated persons may also be permitted to use the Kingdom Hall for a wedding if the committee gives permission, but such undedicated individuals should have a good reputation in the community. It is left to the conscience of the brother who is authorized by law to perform a marriage as to whether he would serve where undedicated individuals may be involved. All weddings and funerals performed in the Kingdom Hall should be dignified and should comply with the local laws. (See &quot;Watchtower&quot; 6/15/72, 1/15/69, 9/15/65 and 12/1/60.)</span></p>

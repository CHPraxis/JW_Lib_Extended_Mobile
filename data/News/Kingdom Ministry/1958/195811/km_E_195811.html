</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a message for the people! Over 194,000 Christian witnesses in New York city this summer were completely thrilled with it. Newspaper headlines proclaimed: “Witnesses Renounce War!” In a matter of seconds the message, in the form of a resolution, became world news. Were you there to enjoy this exciting event?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Compared with the population of the world, only a few persons were there to receive this providential declaration. All people, however, need to give this Resolution the thoughtful consideration that it deserves. How will this be possible? The November 1 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> will contain both the stirring Resolution and the arousing discourse “Why This Convention Should Resolve.” See that all persons of good will get a copy and study it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do not hesitate to distribute this issue. It deals a powerful blow, but it is the kind of information that people of good will are hungering for. People are sick of the hypocrisy of their clergy. They are tired of hot and cold wars. They want peace. And this issue will show them where to find it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The first point of the Resolution exposes the clergy as the ones responsible for hiding God’s name Jehovah from the people. It makes plain that God’s kingdom rules; that the clergy in fear of communism and war have turned their backs on Christ Jesus in favor of counterfeit world governments ; that the nations are now on judgment before God; that, figuratively speaking, Jehovah’s witnesses have beaten their swords into plowshares and will never learn war any more; that they will stand by Jehovah and his kingdom and proclaim it to the ends of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> What a magnificent message to get into the hands of the people! Read this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtovier</span><span class="font10"> and it will thrill you to activity. We want the world to know where we stand, do we not? This copy tells them. Already the Society’s presses in Brooklyn have printed 2,655,000 copies in English, which is 478,000 more than are usually run per issue. Now are you ready? Every congregation should have extra copies ordered. Each publisher should obtain an extra supply for distribution. Suggest to those with whom you conduct Bible studies that they take several copies to place with their friends and business associates. Carry copies with you to place with people you meet on the way to work or when shopping. Ask the people: “Have you ever wondered why in our day conditions should be so bad?” Then say, “I have here a copy of a Resolution adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Knowing Job's Happiness for Endurance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a fine example Job set for us of keeping integrity under stress! And, as the disciple James shows, Job’s endurance had a very happy outcome because “Jehovah is very tender in affection and compassionate.” (Jas. 5:11) It is our privilege now to invite others to share our</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">happy lot, particularly by distributing the Resolution, which, together with supporting argument, appears in the November 1 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How can we best do this during November? First of all by going from house to house, using the ser-Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York that I would like you to read and that tells you what the Bible shows to be the cause of these worsening conditions and the remedy.” Talk Resolution to the people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Get all your copies distributed early in the month. Place the issue with people that have taken the magazine before. Go over your list of friends, back-calls, Bible studies, relatives, neighbors, etc. Leave no stone unturned. Include with your book placements the November 1 issue instead of a booklet. When placing a magazine combination be sure to point out the Resolution. Stress the need of reading it first.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Some 70 million copies of the Resolution will also appear in a four-page tract for distribution during December. This tract will not be passed under the doors, but handed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page</span><span class="font10"> 4, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">col. 3) </span><span class="font10">mon “Condition of the Dead” and offering a bound book and a booklet or, until they have all been placed, a copy of the November 1 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toicer,</span><span class="font10"> on a contribution of fifty cents. As usual, where unable to leave the bound book try to place two magazines, calling attention to the Resolution in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Secondly, every congregation would do well to arrange for special magazine activity on America’s Thanksgiving Day. The November 22 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will carry two timely articles especially prepared for this activity, and on that holiday you will find householders generally more responsive than at other times. If some publishers are unable to get out in the morning, lovingly make arrangements through the service centers to assist them to get out later in the day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Theme: Knowing Job’s Happiness for Endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">13 min: Talk on monthly theme and article “Knowing Job’s Happiness for Endurance.’’ Include some audience participation. (See “Watchtower,” 10/1/57, p. 592, and 11/1/58, p. 668.) 12 min: Vacation-Pioneer During December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As great as the privilege of full-time service is, comparatively few appear to be so situated as to make it their life career. However, for others there is the vacation-pioneer privilege by which one can have the joys of full-time service for at least a part of each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Encouraging us to take advantage of this provision are the reports in our 1958 “Yearbook.” That parents of large families can vacation-pioneer can be seen from the reports from British Guiana (103) and Grenada (272). For proof that the principle of Proverbs 11: 25 applies to vacation pioneering see Dominica’s report (202). After serving one month you may want to extend it to two because of the joys and interest found (170, 172). It may even serve as a steppingstone for regular pioneer activity (269). So why not try vacation pioneering during December?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of main article “Begin Distribution of Resolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">8 min: Talk on November 1 “Watchtower.” Give talking points for placing it and encouragement to place remaining ones this week end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Matt. 5: 16] at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Talk on “Happiness Not from Things.” (See “Awake!” 9/8/58.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Questions and answers on article “Make Return Visits and Start Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">25 min: Demonstration on “You Can Start a Study in November.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Talk on goal of conducting one home Bible study by November 15. All should have a study now. Do you have one? If not, why? Lacking back-calls? Interest cool when you return? Can’t find calls at home? Put yourself in the place of the publisher in the following scenes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (5 min.) Bible study servant, in conversation with mature publisher, asks: “Have you reached the goal of one study yet?” Publisher says he has not because of not having good back-calls to develop. Servant asks to see house-to-house record, but none has been kept. Servant pinpoints need for a record. Publisher acknowledges value, used to keep one, but had no time to make back-calls, so quit keeping record. Servant gives remedy: share regularly in back-call work. There are arrangements made for one hour of back-calling on Sunday, back-call night, prestudy calls on Tuesday night. Publisher agrees, wishes he had done this so he could have a study in November. Servant replies that there are still two weeks left, asks if publisher ever tried to start study on first call. Reply is “No.” Servant arranges to show him how on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (12 min.) Publisher accompanies servant in house-to-house work. Servant presents current sermon; bound book and “This Good News of the Kingdom” are placed. Having interest of householder, servant suggests taking a few minutes to demonstrate use of aids with Bible. She invites them inside. Reference is briefly made to information on death in booklet on page seven. Then discussion is tactfully directed to “good news” theme, which leads to page one, where paragraph consideration begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Chairman cuts in. Bible study servant has been friendly, positive, has shown householder the need to study the publications and has built up the initial interest. But how will he establish a regular home Bible study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (2 min.) After paragraph four is read, publisher joins servant in accentuating value of discussion like this. Householder agrees. To keep interest alive, servant raises interesting questions on God’s name, offers to return and continue discussion on “The True God,” page five. Wednesday evening is agreed upon. Householder is encouraged to read portion to be covered and to look up scriptures cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Stress that you too can start a study. Householder was no exceptional case. Sermon stirs up interest. Unless householder is pressed for time, endeavor to use this proved, successful method to build up initial interest into a study. If he is too busy at the moment, try returning later that day or at least within a few days. Whether we do or do not have a study, all can use this method to start a study in November. 10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [John 21: 17] at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">7 min: New World News report—a talk or discussion between publishers. 10 min: Report from Bible study servant on visit with congregation servant. 10 min: Talk on “Kingdom Service on Thanksgiving Day.” Give suggested presentations and encouragement for all to share in service. Last year’s experiences may be reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18 min: “Presenting the Good News.” To be conducted by the school servant. Demonstrate or illustrate points being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN NOVEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">30 min: Reading of Resolution tract and comments offered on it by the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 min: Demonstration on “How to Distribute the Resolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) You will soon receive 100 tracts containing the Resolution. What will you do with them? Cannot inform world of what you believe if they are left home. We are proud of this Resolution and we want everyone to read it. On December 1 all your brothers in the United States will begin distributing it. Surely you do not want to be left out of this tremendous witness. But how shall we distribute them? Watch how this publisher does it. He has completed his sermon and is presenting the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE I (4 min.) Publisher offers literature, which is taken, and then presents tract. Mentions when and where Resolution was given. States that it is so important that more than 70 million copies are being distributed world-wide in over 50 languages. PMnts out a high fight or two in tract. Chairman then asks publisher what he would do if householder refused literature. Publisher turns to householder, offers literature, which is rejected. He then offers tract, stressing its importance and the immense number being distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE II (3 min.) Publisher accompanied by one with whom he conducts Bible study and who is out in work for first time approaches door. Chairman introduces scene by mentioning that person has been studying and is being started in work. Publisher knocks at a door but no one is home. Good-will person starts to slip tract under door, but publisher says no and explains that tract should be left only when it can be handed to householder. Chairman sets scene at next door, where householder is in, by mentioning that sermon is given and literature is offered. As publisher concludes offer good-will person hands tract to householder making a few remarks about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE III (2 min.) Chairman sets scene by stating that publisher is in street magazine work and has just made presentation and magazines are taken. Publisher then presents tract with a few words about what it contains and about scope of its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SCENE IV (3 min.) Chairman describes scene as a home Bible study. Study has just concluded. Publisher tells good-will person that Resolution was adopted at Divine Will International Assembly and has since been adopted at follow-up assemblies throughout world. He tells about scope of distribution and that it is a declaration to world of our faith in Jehovah’s promises and of our determination to be loyal to Him. He stresses its importance. Encourages good-will person to take several tracts and give to friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Asks audience to suggest additional ways tracts can be distributed. Explains why 100 tracts for each publisher and 500 for pioneers are not too many. Stresses that none should be left undistributed. Help one another to get them out. This is your Resolution. Distribute it enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">5 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant Meets with Bible Study Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In each congregation one brother is appointed by the Society to promote the back-call and Bible study work. This is his assignment and he should be particularly interested in it. With the Bible study servant doing his work well, needed assistance is provided to all to expand their back-call and Bible study activity so that the ingathering work may be speeded up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During November the congregation servant is scheduled to meet with the Bible study servant to review his duties, check on the progress made since their last discussion, and to see how better service can be given to the congregation. This may not always require more time on the part of the servant, but what is desired is that a better use be made of the time he already spends caring for his duties. They should meet early in the month, having prepared ahead of time for their meeting by reviewing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry, Preaching Together in Unity </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font10"> They should also work together several times in the back-call and Bible study work, with the congregation servant giving helpful counsel for improving his teaching ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In addition to briefly taking up the eight points outlined in the November 1057 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font10">the two servants will discuss extensively how the Bible study servant will aid individual publishers (1) to have more back-calls and Bible studies and (2) to conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation-Pioneer During December</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">December is going to be a busy and blessed month filled with theocratic activity. The more one shares in it, the greater his blessings. Arrange to be a vacation pioneer in December and enjoy the blessings in full. Write for an application right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1959 Yearbook and Calendar</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregations may now order the 1959 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> and calendar. It will be appreciated if publishers will order through the congregation. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font10"> are 50e and calendars 25c each. Pioneers on the list before July 1, 1958, may receive a free </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> by placing their request with the literature servant, who will order<sup>1</sup> it with the congregation’s supply.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">Bible studies progressively. The Publisher’s Record card file shows who are not making back-calls regularly and who are not conducting studies. Talk to these publishers personally from time to time. Make definite appointments to assist them with their back-calls and to go with them on their studies. Is there anything that could be done to give these good-will persons better service? Discuss the study with the publisher conducting it. The Bible study file gives a good picture of the potential growth of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In many congregations the Bible study servant is also a book study conductor, but there will be many opportunities over and above the activity in his own service center to promote back-call and Bible study work as far as the congregation as a whole is concerned. He will be able to talk enthusiastically to the publishers at their homes, from the platform, before and after meetings. After a number of months, the congregation servant can give consideration to assigning the Bible study servant to conduct another study, if convenient, so as to build up that group in the back-call and Bible study work as well as in other ways. If the Bible study servant is not a book study conductor, arrangements will be made for him to work with a service center long enough to really build up the back-call and Bible study work. He may remain in one place several months if neces-I sary.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Make Return Visits and Start Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> One of our service goals this year is calling back on all who show interest, with the objective of establishing home Bible studies. The need is great: 61.7 percent of the publishers make some back-calls, but 38.3 percent are not sharing in the work at all. A fine 3.5-percent increase was made last year in the number conducting Bible studies, with 37.8 percent now having some share, but there is more to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Why do some not participate in these features of service? They may fail to appreciate their importance or they may not make placements; they definitely do need help. Many irregular in service are not regular in meeting attendance either, so naturally their appreciation is not strong. Build a solid foundation by helping them with meeting attendance and participation at the same time as you are taking them along on back-calls and Bible studies. And do not leave them on their own until appreciation is clearly evident both at meetings and in interest in the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Those needing assistance with back-calls and studies should receive it through the training program, and by the personal interest of the Bible study servant and the book study conductors. These servants should take the lead, making appointments to go on back-calls with one or more publishers to establish Bible studies each week. If you feel that you need help and you are not now receiving it, then take the initiative by requesting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Publishers short on back-calls should remind themselves to call back on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> who take any literature or show any interest. This requires time, and it should be a time set aside each week for back-calls. Do you personally have such an arrangement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Persons of good will are the Lord’s sheep and their lives have been entrusted to our care. We love them; we are anxious to see them progress. Each back-call should be planned with the needs of the individual in mind, and with a view to starting a home Bible study. Your joy will be multiplied in proportion to your share in this rewarding service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 12—Motivating Climax</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The goal of our doorstep sermons is to arouse the householders’ Interest and then to place Bible literature with them. To realize that goal we must go farther than merely having interest-rousing introductions and instructive sermons. We must convince, awaken a desire for the literature and then induce the householder to act on that desire. In short, we must have a motivating climax.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This motivating climax cannot be hung on thin air, as it were. It must be reached through proper development. Even though by use of scriptures, logic and coherence we convince as to the rightness of what we say, still often the householder is not interested in taking any literature. We have failed to awaken a desire for it. Our presentation may have seemed academic. So we must do more, we must show the value of this message in his life, what peace of mind, happiness, hope for the future it can bring. Point out what it has done for you, for others, especially as noted by the recent international assembly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> So climax your sermon with real appeal. Show the householder how the book will benefit him and his family and will aid him to help</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Job's Happiness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> But, above all else, November should see us stressing the starting of home Bible studies in keeping with the second of our service year goals: “Calling back on all interested persons and placements with the objective of establishing home Bible studies.” Remember, our goal is for each one to be conducting at least one home Bible study by November 15. Pioneers should now strive to meet the goal of seven studies, and special pioneers ten each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> To establish a home Bible study we must start right with friendly, effective and regular house-to-house activity. Sensitive mental discernment will keep us from causing needless offense at our back-call. Let them find the texts in their own Bible, using the sermon outlined in the October </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font10">others. Show him that there never will be a better time; that he likely will not have more time to read than now in this busy world. With eyes sincerely directed at the householder, be positive and forceful so that he feels impelled to act in harmony with your words. Let him feel, “This is for me.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Upon having made your final point appealing to the individual there still may be a bit of suspense as he hesitates to make the decision. Since your motive is wholly unselfish, feel free to help him make the right decision. So instead of leaving the decision up to him by asking him if he wants the book, positively state: “This book we place on a contribution of only fifty cents. You may have this copy [placing it into his hands], I know you will gain lasting benefits from reading it together with your Bible.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Joshua’s final speech to Israel is a good example of a sermon that had a motivating climax. So effective was it that even though he challengingly tried to dissuade them from theii- decision they stuck to it, saying: “No, but Jehovah we shall serve!” (Josh. 24:21) So too, if we arouse sufficient interest, conviction and desire, they will want the literature even though they may know that others will oppose.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Lead logically to a study in the October 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> in any booklet having study questions or in a bound book, including </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Prom Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR DECEMBER Any bound book and a booklet for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR DECEMBER Finding a Safeguard in Integrity. —Ps. 25: 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> And how about helping others to establish a home Bible study or turning one of yours over to such a one if you have several? It is preferable, however, to assist the one you are training to follow through, from original call to back-call and home Bible study. Let us make November a truly fruitful and happy month !</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ In spite of opposition, Poland reports three successive new peaks, in May, June and July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Two more pioneers give impetus to work in Greenland. Peak of six publishers in July.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution of Resolution </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font10">directly to the people, and they will be asked to read it. It will be all right for the brothers working in scattered rural territories to leave a copy of the Resolution under the door if the people are not at home. In some rural sections brothers do not get back over their territory very often and if they have few homes to call on because of distance between homes or ranches, it will be all right to leave the Resolution tract. If there are plenty of homes, however, talk to the people and hand them their copy. Each publisher will be assigned 1.00 for distribution; pioneers will receive 500 tracts each. These will be consigned to the congregations and will be on hand for distribution December 1. So plan now for the greatest witness ever given to Jehovah’s name and to the advancement of the theocracy.</span></p>

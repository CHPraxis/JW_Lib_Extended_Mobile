</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry goes</span><span class="font9"> to press Jehovah’s witnesses in New York are as busy as any people can be. The tremendous assembly preparations are reaching their climax and already persons from many countries are arriving. Work ! Work I Work! and we all love it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s people everywhere confidently expect that many spiritual blessings are in store for them at the Divine Will International Assembly and they are making every effort to attend. They look forward to .seeing and hearing much to help them keep the divine will clearly in mind. Without doubt, their expectations will be more than realized.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>s</sup> Even as in going to such an assembly we should have uppermost in mind the spiritual blessings to be received, both of taking in accurate knowledge and of service, so upon returning from it we should have most prominently before us the applying of the knowledge received there, so that we might be more efficient and zealous witnesses for Jehovah.—John 2:17; 2 Tim. 2: 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> To realize that result, however, takes conscious, deliberate effort on our part. So, after we have returned from the assembly let us look over the notes we have taken—in obedience to instructions—and refresh our minds regarding the valuable suggestions received and make use of them as opportunity affords. If all of us do that, then we will indeed be effectively “pr'eaching the Kingdom in unity,” our theme for the month, and be harmoniously telling to all: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and over.”—Rev. 11: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> This means co-operating with our brothers, particularly with the servants appointed to direct and take the lead. It means being regular and punctual at the various contacts for field service. It also means being properly equipped, with literature, with a well-prepared sermon and, above all, with a heart full of love for Jehovah and our fellow man.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> AU of us will be looking forward with keen anticipation and joy to getting back to those on our back-call lists and all those with whom we conduct Bible studies to tell them about tiie many blessings received at the assembly. Show them the program, newspaper clippings and whatever else we may have of theocratic interest. This may furnish the needed impetus for newly interested ones to appreciate that they need a regular Bible study and for those with whom we conduct home Bible studies to appreciate their-need of sharing in the witness work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Working unassigned territory will be our special activity during August as well as September. It is difficult to reach the people in this territory in the wintertime, so let us make good use of the fine summer</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> A life of expectancy is a living expression of a Christian’s faith in Jehovah’s Word and promise of a new world. And there is no better way to keep the spirit of expectancy alive than to remain active in the ministry; more than that, to expand our usefulness in the ministry to the very limits of our ability. “For whoever has, more will be given him and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”—Matt. 13: 12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">and early autumn weather to witness to them. It is very likely that they will have heard about our assembly on the radio or TV, or read about it in the newspapers, all of which should make them more receptive to the message we bring to them in person.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> The literature offer to be presented in all such territory will be subscriptions for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines, with six free booklets, on a contribution of two dollars. Where the complete offer is not desired try to obtain a subscription for one of the magazines (with three free booklets) or else try to place the offer that applies to all other territory, two bound books and two booklets on a contribution of one dollar If unable to place either of these, then offer two magazines on a contribution of ten cents. In any event, leave at least a booklet or a tract at every door, whether anyone is home or not. Your congregation may have some older booklets </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Seeing the nearness of Armageddon, the glorious fulfillment of Bible prophecies, should move us to want to expand our ministry as never before. It should fire us into tlie pioneer work, into areas where the need is great and, what is more, it should keep us there. The full-time ministry, an expanded ministry, keeps alive the freshness of Christian faith, hope and the vision of the new world. An active life in the ministry becomes a living sermon of what we believe. It is a life of expectancy.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> “But we can’t all pioneer,” you say. Perhaps not. But we can all look ahead and plan to vacation pioneer as often as possible.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Theme: Preaching the Kingdom in Unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12 min: Talk on “Where the Need Is Greater.’’ “Serving where the need is great” originally meant going to another country, such as the examples given in our 1958 “Yearbook” in reports from Australia and North Borneo. (86, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">248) However, it also</span><span class="font8"> means serving in isolated territory in one’s own country, as noted by the reports from France, Korea and Liberia. (158, 194, 205)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">True, most of us may not be able to go to a foreign country, and we may not be able to pull up stakes, as it •were, and go to some distant part of the United States, as did one couple. (72) But if we have the spirit of serving where the need is great we most likely can do something about it: Work such unassigned territory as may be accessible to us during August and September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the main article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">18 min: Stirring talk on “Preaching the Kingdom in Unity.” Enthusiastically discuss the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses and what an outstanding example it is of preaching the Kingdom in unity. (See “Watchtower,” 8/1/58, p. 479.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on reference based on 1 Cor. 1: 10 at bottom of page one.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Assembly Blessings Report. Discuss high lights of the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, bringing in a few appropriate experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Talk, together with questions and answers, on “Aiding the Other Sheep Through the Theocratic Ministry School.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">20 min: Sermon Refresher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Talk on “Need of a Sermon.” Show necessity of using sermon to cultivate interest and to impress on people the Scripturalness of our work. Effective use of Bible by all shows we are ministers, not salesmen. Sermons should draw people out, reveal their thinking so it may be brought in line with Bible truths. Our sermons have been used world-wide to help set the thinking of multitudes straight on “Who Is Jehovah?” “Armageddon,” etc. When all use sermons, truths on these matters are driven home to millions. They cause people to open their minds and think on Bible subjects. Effect is felt in territory only when all use sermons regularly. Let us go over current sermon together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (10 min.) Discuss current sermon (May “Kingdom Ministry”) with audience. Different introductions might be suggested, such as: “We are making brief calls this morning to share some good thoughts with you and your neighbors. As part of an international group of ministers, we’ve noted a serious trend toward materialistic thinking throughout the world. It appears to us that most people today are concerned with getting wealthy or at least ‘keeping up with the Joneses.’ You may have noticed this yourself. This way of thinking is quite in contrast with the wise course Jesus said would gain God’s approval. Perhaps you’ll recall the principle he expressed at Matthew 6: 33. After showing we should not be overly concerned with our daily needs, he said</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When discussing parable (Luke 12: 16-21), encourage all to tell story in their own words and then read just verses 20 and 21, contrasting course of right thinking that leads to life with materialistic thinking that leads to death. Different ways of presenting this point may be suggested by audience. Transition to Eccl. 7: 12 might be handled by saying: “While money is needed to defend one against starvation and to clothe us under present conditions, only real knowledge from God’s Word can give persons everlasting life. As the wise man said . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then going from that scripture to John 17: 3 one could say: “To live forever under perfect and righteous conditions is certainly worth knowing more about. To gain everlasting life means taking in knowledge of the one who can give it to us—Jehovah God. As Jesus said . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Audience can then give additional suggestions for making transitions and for going from the sermon to the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN- (7 min.) Calls on mature publisher to give sermon before audience. Then chairman concludes with brief remarks on value and need of all using sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: New World News Report. Include items and experiences pertaining to the international assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">23 min: Demonstration on “Sharing Assembly Benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Rousing talk on need of taking assembly benefits to those who missed it. Much good publicity has been given in newspapers, on radio and television (local examples might be mentioned), so people are familiar with the assembly and will wish to know more about it. Put new things learned into use immediately so they are not forgotten. Real value will come in talking to good-will persons on whom we make back-calls and those with whom we study about the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Assembly</span><span class="font8"> talks and activities and how greatly all benefited from being in attendance. Help all to know* what the divine will is for today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On introducing demonstration, stress to the brothers that when making back-calls or talking to ones with whom we study we can briefly mention the city of New York and its many wonders or our trip to and from the assembly. But then quickly get down to the really important part of our visit to New York, the assembly and its benefits. Watch and see how this may be properly done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION (6 min.) Publisher making a back-call the first week following his return from the assembly. The good-will person inquires as to his trip, how he liked New York, etc. Publisher briefly tells of pleasant travels, comments about New York city and how much the city was impressed by the huge assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. With the notes he has taken and with the program at hand, he tells the person of good will some outstanding assembly high lights— statements made, new truths, things of real interest to the good-will person. He describes the harmony and the orderly operation of the various departments, the great advertising done. He briefly describes the packed stadiums, the people from foreign countries that were met, things he has brought home from the assembly, etc. Good-will person is greatly impressed and accepts publisher’s invitation to attend next meeting with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (12 min.) Chairman invites publishers in audience to give their impressions of the assembly. Thoughts should be directed along lines that will be helpful to persons of good will and brothers ■who did not attend the assembly. Points from talks, experiences and any other assembly happenings may be mentioned with the thought of stirring others to associate with the congregation and to engage in the field service. Chairman will also use some of this time to encourage all to keep assembly spirit alive so they may be activated throughout the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Talk on “Expand Your Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font8">min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on reference based on Heb. 13: 16 at bottom of page four.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things” on Minister of God, from page 263 to 265, Acts 4: 13. To be handled by question-and-answer method. 20 min; “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration. To be conducted by the school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">15 min: Arrange locally. (Suggested talk: “Do Today’s ‘Faith Healers' Measure Up?” See “Awake!” 7/8/58.) 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those congregations having a fifth meeting should arrange their own program locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for “Awake!” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Congregations wishing additional copies of the October 8 and 22 Issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> for use in the campaign are requested to fill out and submit Magazine Distributors’ order blanks. Orders should be sent in by September 1. The October 15 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will be a very special issue too and all the publishers will want to give it a wide distribution in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Starting September 7, 1958, circuit servants will give the public talk: “Is Love Practical Among the Nations in Our Time?” At circuit assemblies starting in September district servants will give the public talk: “The Watch Tower Society in God’s Purpose.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Aiding the Other Sheep Through the Theocratic Ministry School</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> All Kingdom ministers, not just the servants, have a special responsibility toward those newly interested in the truth. God’s Word shows that our responsibility Is to aid the new ones to preach the Kingdom in unity with the New World society and to encourage and aid them to attend assemblies and all congregation meetings. The theocratic ministry school is one meeting that plays a special role in aiding the other sheep.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> It is at the ministry school that newly interested ones, as well as the brothers, really work at gaining the required maturity by making a systematic study of the books of the Bible. It is at this meeting that they learn how to express themselves clearly and how to explain a subject logically. The ministry school program has kept us up to date on the recent publications of the Society, enabling us to keep important points fresh in mind. Truly the ministry school aids those in attendance to be “fully competent” in Kingdom preaching.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Are you doing your part in encouraging newly interested ones to attend the ministry school? The school servant should take the initiative in inviting new ones to attend and enroll. He should do this, not only from the platform, but also by showing personal interest in them. All publishers have this responsibil-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REVISED FORMS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Sample copies of the new “Remittance and Credit Request” and “Subscription Record” sheet are being sent with the August statements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The new “Remittance and Credit Request” form serves the same purposes as the two former forms, the “Remittance Form” and the “Literature Credit Request.” See instructions on the back of the new form for proper use of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The revised “Subscription Record” sheet has no place to record the number of subscriptions and the accompanying remittance, as this is now to be shown on the new “Remittance and Credit Request” form. Each time a “Subscription Record” sheet is sent to the Society, it must be accompanied by a “Remittance and Credit Request” form properly filled out under the subscriptions section.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Please use up all the old forms first and order the new ones when a new supply is needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">ity also. (Phil. 2:4) at the congregation book studies all publishers can encourage new ones to attend the ministry school. Do not feel that the study conductor has the sole responsibility in this regard. Another good time for stressing the ministry school is after home Bible studies. By referring to page 206 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”,</span><span class="font9"> you can explain the Scriptural precedent for the ministry school.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The invitation to attend the ministry school will include, for some, encouragement to enroll in the school. Remember, one does not have to be baptized to be enrolled. Each student should be encouraged to accept his assignments and to fulfill them to the best of his ability, not only for his own benefit but for that of those attending. All publishers, whether enrolled or not, should come prepared to answer review questions and to offer interpretative points on the Bible reading. The training in public reading, in preparing talks, in giving talks, in receiving counsel, in listening to instruction and student talks and taking the written review will be of inestimable value in aiding the newly interested ones to “press on to maturity.”—Heb. 6 :1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Do your part. Attend yourself and encourage others to do so Let all publishers be alert to their responsibility in aiding the other sheep through the theocratic ministry school.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION REPORTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While many of the brothers will have obtained 5-cent copies of the report at the assembly, everyone will want the 128-page report when it is over. The congregation servant should therefore ascertain the quantity desired and order them. They are a cash item and the charge is 30 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION PANORAMIC PICTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society is not providing any 8&quot;-x-10&quot;-size photographs or any other pictures at the stadium during the convention itself. However, we are planning to have a large beautiful composite picture showing Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds on one large picture, 16&quot; x 30&quot;. It is a very fine picture for your Kingdom Hall and undoubtedly every congregation will desire to have one. If any others are wanted by the publishers, the congregation servant should ascertain their needs and order them as cash items. The charge for these will be 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE INVENTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two Literature Inventory forms are being sent to each congregation. An actual-count inventory of literature is to be taken accurately and completely on September 1 and recorded on these forms. Pioneers associated with congregations will turn in to the literature servant a signed slip showing how many books and thirty-two-, sixty-four- and ninety-six-page booklets they have. The total for pioneers will be shown at the bottom of the Literature Inventory form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The congregation servant should check with the literature servant to see that the inventory is properly taken and give him help if necessary. Also, he will check with the magazine-territory servant to see that he takes his inventory properly and records it on the Literature Inventory form, which has been revised to include the magazine inventory. The original should be sent to the Society not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">later than September 3</span><span class="font9"> and the duplicate retained for the congregation’s files. The results of this inventory and the latest statement of the congregation’s standing with the Society should be read to the congregation at a service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH EDITION BIBLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following British edition King James Version Bibles, approximately 7&quot; x 5&quot; with a soft flexible cover, are now in stock at Brooklyn. Remittance should accompany orders for these cash-item Bibles. Bible AF 3401, 5/8&quot; thick, in blue, maroon or black, $3.15. AF 3491, 5/8&quot; thick, in black only, $4.80. A 3801, 15/16&quot; thick, in blue, maroon or black, $3.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Identification Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The identification cards now in use expire August 31, 1958. New cards, which expire August 31, 1960, are available at the rate of two cards for one cent. It would be well for congregation servants to reconsider information in the September, 1954, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font9"> regarding the use of the card before ordering. Only dedicated publishers and pioneers who regularly engage in house-to-house work, and who are capable of doing so alone, qualify for cards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential Qualities of Sermons Part 9: Enthusiasm</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What is the purpose of our ministry? Is it not to convince and stir to action those to whom we bring the message of life? To do that we need to employ one of the prime requisites for successful sermons— enthusiasm. Without it we cannot be entirely productive in our ministry. But what is enthusiasm? Interestingly, it means “God-inspired.” It suggests zeal and devotion to a cause.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> To be enthusiastic about something you have to be convinced that it is good and worth while. You want to share it with others and help them to appreciate its value too. Is not the Kingdom message the most valuable possession we have? In your delivery of it, are you keenly Interested in what you are saying? Do you reflect that in an animated, warm delivery?

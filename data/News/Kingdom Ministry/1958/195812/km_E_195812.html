<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>SERVING JEHOVAH WHOLE-SOULED IN DECEMBER</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">70,000,000 Tracts to Be Distributed A 1 O-Percent Increase</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Whole-souled service to Jehovah is what will be required if we are going to accomplish the tremendous task ahead of us this month. But all of it is integrity-keeping work, the kind of work that brings Jehovah praise and is a safeguard to us. David prayed: “Let integrity and uprightness themselves safeguard me,” and that they will, if we serve Jehovah whole-souled. There are some 70,000,000 tracts containing the Resolution to be distributed, back-calls to make and a special Magazine Day in which to join. There is also a 10-percent increase to achieve by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, all of which calls for whole-souled service.—I’s. 25: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In the United States publishers and pioneers are set to distribute 26,500,000 tracts as their goal. Each of us has a quota to meet and work to do. The congregation publisher will be consigned 100 tracts, the pioneers and special pioneers 500 apiece. The quota for the circuit and district servants and their wives is 250 tracts each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> To be sure that we are able to get all of these tracts into the hands of the public, the following manner of distribution will be used : Instead of presenting the tract with the literature offer as recommended in the November </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font9">it will be presented alone. Give a brief introduction, placing the Resolution in the hand of the householder and encouraging him to read it. Tell the people that you would like to hear their comment regarding it when you call again in a few weeks. That is all. Each place where a tract is placed be sure a record is kept of the address and of the person’s name, if possible. After having placed all your tracts or your quota, start back over your territory, making back-calls on each receiver of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Resolution. Get people to express themselves on the Resolution. Give the Kingdom sermon appearing in “Your Service Meetings” and present the literature offer for the month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> A word of caution. The tract is not to be left where people are not at home, unless you are working in the rurals and do not intend to return during this special campaign. In the city make a note of the notat-homes and call back. Take a personal interest in each one with whom you leave a tract. Do not hand out the tract promiscuously on the streets. It is not a handbill and it should not be used as one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Thorough planning will be necessary for effective distribution to begin with special activity on Monday, December 1. At the earliest moment possible the congregation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR DECEMBER Any bound book and a booklet for 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THEME FOR DECEMBER Finding a Safeguard in Integrity. ' —Ps. 25:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">servant should meet with the study conductors to arrange midweek witnessing for tract distribution at times suitable for each group. Some evening distribution could be done in some territories. He should see to it that arrangements are made so publishers can conveniently engage in prestudy tract distribution. Study conductors can briefly demonstrate to their groups how best to present the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Make personal preparation as to when and where you will share in this special service. Do incidental witnessing to and from work and during your lunch hour. Remember, it is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font9"> Resolution. Eeel personally responsible to distribute your quota. If for some unavoidable reason you cannot do so, then let your congregation servant know so that he can assign someone to assist you to distribute them all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> The Resolution tract invites people to write to the Society for the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom Rules —Is the World’s End Near?</span><span class="font9"> As quickly as requests are received by the Society the booklet will be sent to the individual and a back-call slip will be sent to the congregation. Congregations should quickly make visits on these persons, as outlined in the demonstration in “Your Service Meetings.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazine Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>s</sup> Christendom’s “Christmas” is a good day to be found whole-souled for Jehovah by aiding others in Kingdom service. Each congregation will make this day a special Magazine Day. Last year many congregations had morning and afternoon contacts, with excellent results. When working with the regular offer during the time of the world’s holidays, publishers will find the Kingdom sermon outlined under “Your Service Meetings” very suitable. Unusual results and experiences should be sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10-Percent Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> The prospects for reaching a 10-percent increase this December are excellent. We need 222,355 publishers, and we have had 226,797 in April. The assistant congregation servant should check his files and inform the study conductors of those needing attention. The Bible study servant should check his files and select those studies that appear to be prospective publishers. Then he should check with the one holding the study about the possibilities of starting the new one in service with the tracts. Both servants should do this by the first of December. If all publishers go out sometime dur-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN: (4 min.) Talk on importance of Resolution and our following through on it. By now almost all the seventy million copies are undoubtedly in the hands of the people. Now what? Shall we let this mighty effort end here? By no means! All publishers have kept house-to-house records and have addresses of at least one hundred homes where Resolutions were left. Make return calls immediately. Start home Bible studies where possible. Demonstration of effective follow-up of Resolution placements is introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DEMONSTRATION: (12 min.) Publisher approaches door where he left</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Resolution. “Good evening, Mr. ----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I’ve returned to talk with you about that Resolution I left with you a couple of weeks ago. Its subject matter is so vital that I wanted to obtain your opinion on it and explain any points you might wish further information on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Opinions can be discussed or objections overcome; then lead into the sermon on “God’s Kingdom” given below. If householder offers no comment, publisher can lead into the sermon as follows: “You may wonder how Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide can overcome the barriers of race, creed, nationality and language to adopt such a Resolution, uniting men of all kinds and embracing one common hope for mankind’s problems. It is because their hope is God’s answer to man’s problems—his kingdom. Did you know that the Kingdom is the theme of the Bible? Undoubtedly you pray the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ [or the ‘Our Father’] . . .” Sermon on “God’s Kingdom” is then given. (Scriptures marked with an asterisk may be paraphrased.)</span></p>

Use the method outlined in the November “Kingdom Ministry” to start studies, wherever possible, on the first follow-up call. The Society will send congregations good-will slips for all persons in their territory who write to the Society for the booklet. As these are received, give them special attention. On making these calls, follow the arrangement just demonstrated. About seventy million homes have the Resolution. In our territory ---homes have it. What a tremendous potential is there! Be sure the full potential is realized in our territory by making prompt and effective followup calls!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN DECEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things,” page 268, Method of Preaching, to Eph. 4:11 on page 269. To be handled by audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10 min: Report from the magazine-territory servant regarding his visit with the congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">24 min: Demonstration in which partners outline complete plan of action for back-call and carry it out, starting home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) All God’s ministers want to get results in their ministry. To do so must be TEACHERS. Servants responsible to see goal of Bible study for each publisher realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE I (4 min.) Congregation and Bible study servants discuss need of mature publishers not only teaching new good-will persons but also their brothers not yet teaching. Servants select from file cards of some doing well in placements but without studies. They plan to work with some of these themselves and to arrange for mature publishers conducting studies to work with the others as partners to show them exactly how they must plan every step of back-call before, going, so that newer one can follow and take part. He will be taught, not just impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE II (6 min.) Bible study servant, having made arrangements to make back-call with brother needing help, meets with him to plan and prepare for back-call. Using current sermon, “Hope for the Dead,” they plan introduction, how to lead into first scripture, what to say about it, how they will get householder to comment and how to lead to next scripture. Chairman breaks in after second text discussed and says: “Let’s see how they plan to follow from the last scripture of the sermon to a place in the literature.” Partners then do this. (“This Good News of the Kingdom,” page 7, par. 10, may be used.) They decide on which texts each will read and what comments he will make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SCENE III (8 min.) Back-call starts at door. Householder manifests interest after first text and invites partners in. Encouraged to comment, he takes part in discussion. (After second scripture chairman breaks in to say, “Now we will see whether they follow their plan to get into a study in the literature.”) Publisher reads final scripture, comments, speaks of God’s love and mercy and how he fulfills purpose originally intended with Adam, then asks: “But what made the resurrection necessary in God’s purpose? Why has there been so much suffering? God’s Word, the Bible, with the helps available today, answers these questions. Note here in this booklet you have, ‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’ ” (Discuss paragraph 10.) Chairman breaks in, explains, that study is thus started and definite arrangements are made for continuing study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Stresses need for plan before each call and following that plan with confidence. In that way brothers will not only get better results but will also be TEACHING their brothers. Privilege not limited to servants. All in training program to remember it is not completed with house-to-house training. It must extend into back-call and Bible study work. The goal is for each one being trained to conduct a home Bible study of his own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Visit with Magazine-Territory Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> December is the month the congregation servant reviews the work and duties of the magazine-territory servant. A key role is played by the magazine-territory servant: Falling upon him is much of the responsibility to organize magazine distribution properly and to see that coverage of territory is systematic and complete. In meeting together, the two servants will be alert as to how local arrangements can be improved. Several times during the month the two should work together in the field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> First they should review the duties of the magazine-territory servant in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers. </span><span class="font9">Then the ten points listed in the December, 1957, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font9">should be briefly considered. Most attention should be given to these three points:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Greater support of magazine distribution:</span><span class="font9"> The magazine-territory servant should enthusiastically encourage all publishers to share in magazine distribution. Provision is made for all to receive a regular supply to distribute throughout each week. It is important that definite service contacts be arranged, especially on Magazine Day. The magazine-territory servant should take</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">From January through April the literature offer will be a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> with three booklets, for $1. Congregations should ascertain their increased magazine needs for the campaign and submit a Magazine Distributor’s Order right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bound Volumes</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Orders may now be placed for the 1958 bound volumes of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> It will be appreciated if publishers and pioneers will order through the local congregation.

He should be adept in using the thirty- to sixty-second presentations and be an effective teacher of others. By taking the initiative he will be able to tactfully make arrangements to have those who share irregularly in magazine work to accompany him and cultivate the good habit of regular participation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Systematic coverage of territory: </span><span class="font9">This requires proper use of the territory records and closely checking with the publishers and study conductors holding territory. Some territories may not be worked as frequently as others. Arrange to cover all territories regularly with the literature offer and with magazines. Do this so that one coverage does not conflict with the other. Try to witness to the occupants of every home in the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Advertising local activities:</span><span class="font9"> Consider ways to advertise the Kingdom Hall and meetings, such as a literature display and a sign showing time of meetings. Notices of meetings in the newspaper are good advertising. Special events can also be used for publicity, such as special public talks, Memorial, Kingdom Hall dedications, etc. Let us use all reasonable means of advertising the reigning King and the Kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving Jehovah in December </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font9">ing December and if we help new ones to preach, we should not only reach a 10-percent increase but a new all-time peak in publishers. Those congregations reaching the goal should put “We Made It!” on the bottom of the report card.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Many publishers have begun to share in the back-call and home Bible study work. Now we want to follow through and apply the information appearing in the September 1, 1958, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> article, “Teaching Men of Good Will,” especially paragraphs 18 through 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Here, then, is the work outlined for us: Concentrate on Resolution tracts, putting all of them out as early in December as possible. Call back on each one receiving a tract. Aid others to preach. Join in the special Magazine Day. Follow through, bringing new ones to maturity. Together let us work whole-souled, as the apostle counsels: “Be slaves with good inclinations, as to Jehovah, and not to men, for you know that each one, whatever good he may do, will receive this back from Jehovah.”—Eph. 6: 6-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Appreciating the Pioneer Service</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What stirring words were heard at the Divine Will assembly concerning our desire for a life full of Jehovah’s service! The talks on “Fullness of Service Day,” such as “Filling the Need in Our Own Country” and “Can I Pursue Pioneer Privileges?” resulted in many expressions of fervent desire to have a fuller share in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Knowing this desire is in the hearts of the brothers, the Society has planned a special program for the next six months. It will enable many to realize their heartfelt desire to do the divine will full time; it will aid all to a richer appreciation of the pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Starting in December, the Society will send the first of a series of special letters to each congregation. These letters will be read at the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study early each month and thereafter will be read and discussed at the service meeting, according to instructions that will appear under “Tour Service Meetings.” Pioneers and circuit and district servants will also receive special letters of instruction as to their part in the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Our keen desire is to get the good news preached, to see Jehovah’s Word move speedily and mightily. So all who are assigned a talk or a part in conjunction with this program will want to give it wholehearted support. Prepare well. Take into consideration local circumstances. Really help Jehovah’s people talk and think pioneering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> True, not all can pioneer, but appreciation can be deepened and many who previously could not pioneer may now see the way open. So remember that your counsel and admonition should enrich everyone associated with Jehovah’s organization with the gem of appreciation for the full-time service. Your thoughtful, enthusiastic participation will aid many to have a fuller share in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Distribute the Resolution</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Before going out to distribute your quota of Resolution tracts, have clearly in mind the manner in which it is to be done and what you are going to say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When the householder comes to the door, offer nothing else but the tract. Greet him and say something like this : “Here is your copy of a Resolution [hand it to him] that was adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses this summer. It is a declaration of Christian faith that is of great interest to all persons who take their religion seriously.” Or you could say it this way: “I would like to leave this Resolution for you to read. It was adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses and clearly states their position. What it says is of vital concern to everyone who prays for God’s kingdom.” for persons who do not profess to be Christians you might say: “This is your free copy of a Resolution that is of vital concern to all people. It was adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and more than seventy million copies are being distributed world-wide.” There is no need to comment on the tract’s contents.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The divine wull for the 1959 service year has set before us seven goals. Fittingly, one of these is regularity in all features of field service. Though many publishers fail to appreciate it, such regularity is most basic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What an honor it is to be witnesses of Jehovah in this day of his vindication! What a privilege it is to bring life-giving truths to men of good will I If we appreciate our happy lot we will do our best to meet the divine will of regularity in all features of the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Why be regular in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> features of field service? Because each is essential. Magazine activity has its particular effectiveness by reason of hear his comment on the contents of the Resolution when you call again in a few weeks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> On the return visit remind the person of your initial call with the Resolution. Answer his questions. Whether he offers comments or not, give the sermon on the Kingdom and present the current offer of literature. You might say something like this: “I called on you a short time ago and left a copy of a Resolution that was adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I promised to return for your impression of it.” If you are not certain whether this is the same person to whom you gave the Resolution, you could mention your previous call and the Resolution that was left, and say : “Did you have opportunity to read it?” If the answer is no, state that it was a declaration of faith in God’s kingdom and proceed to give the sermon on the Kingdom arid offer the literature. The back-call would be more effective if the person’s name could be obtained at the first visit so that the same person could</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">the appeal of magazines, the short sermon and the small contribution. It reaches those with but a minimum of interest. By the house-to-house work we most thoroughly search for the other sheep, appealing to serious-minded lovers of righteousness by our Bible sermons. By following through with back-calls and home Bible studies we help them to grow in knowledge and understanding, leading to their dedication, which is an important step in gaining life. And by incidental witnessing we reach many we could not otherwise reach, and that under more favorable conditions.</span></p>

Share in magazine activity on Magazine Day, before the congregation book study, on the way to the market or after school. Care for your back-calls and Bible studies on that third hour Sundays, some weekday, on back-call night or before the congregation book study. And be alert to opportunities for incidental witnessing, at home, at work, when shopping or traveling.</span></p>

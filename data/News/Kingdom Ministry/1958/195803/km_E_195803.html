<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Christian ministry is indeed a beautiful trust that has been committed to our care. It is a trust by reason of our dedication to God, and should we fall short, this trust will be taken away from us and given to others who will properly guard it. Guarding it gratefully and appreciatively results in life to both ourselves and those who hear us. So, “this beautiful trust guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us.”—2 Tim. 1:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> This trust obligates us to share in all features of the ministry, cooperating with those who bear rule over us. (Heb. 13 :17) During March this means concentrating on obtaining </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions on a contribution of one dollar, offering therewith also three booklets. Where the householder already is a subscriber, a subscription for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">may be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How are we doing so far ? Is this campaign the best yet for you? Does our Kingdom Hall chart show that we have reached the halfway mark ? Has each congregation publisher obtained at least one subscription? each pioneer ten? each special pioneer fifteen during the first two months ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Often included in the present heavy subscription mail being received by the Society are happy experiences had by those getting new subscriptions. Our new sermon ties in very well with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">offer. Use that sermon regularly and efficiently and you too will have interesting experiences to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Nor should we overlook the back-call and home Bible study activities. Be sure to call back on all those promising to subscribe later, as well as on all those having subscribed. Use the sermon outlined under the third service meeting. Prepare it well and you will enjoy using it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>G</sup> More than that, you will find it to be effective in starting a home Bible study. Are all publishers in the congregation who are able to do so conducting at least one home Bible study? Are the servants exemplary in this regard? Studies can be started very easily with the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”. </span><span class="font11">Reports one circuit servant: “I met a young housewife on Wednesday and placed a book and booklet with her; called back on Friday and started a study; on Sunday she was at the public talk, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and final talk. As she left she expressed very warm appreciation for what had been done for her.” Another letter just recently received told of a publisher’s calling back the</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">evening meal along with Christ’s brothers April 3, ready for a special talk April 6, ready for special magazine distribution, using the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and the April 22 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> ready to wind up the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription campaign with an extra-special effort, ready to help new ones to get started preaching, ready to care for a 20-percent increase and a new peak a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> But whether on the same day, a few days or a week later, by all means let us keep on calling back, endeavoring to start home Bible studies. After all, our goal is gaining additional praisers of Jehovah, who will share in the vindication of his name and gain life in his new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> And so, what about those with whom we have been studying for a time? If we are to reach our 20-per-cent increase in Jehovah’s praisers in April we must be working at this goal in March, starting them out in the service and continuing to aid them during April and in the months to follow. We may not make our goal if we wait until April to begin I in Kingdom publishers. Indeed, we have sound reasons for wanting to be ready, but are we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> First and foremost is the Memorial celebration. You most certainly will want to be present at the celebration and you will want all persons of good will to be there too. So invite them now. Help them to attend by calling by for them. Keep reminding them of the date, April 3, each time you call between now and then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Remember, too, that Memorial weekend will be devoted to special service. Congregations having no service meeting Friday should make back-calls, inviting people to attend Sunday’s timely talk, “A New Song for All Men of Good Will.” All day Saturday will be magazine day and every publisher should want to have a part in this feature of service. Sunday will be devoted to house-to-house work with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription offer and, of course, you will want to invite people to the special talk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Brisk New World News report. (Include “Happy in Congregating.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Use of the ‘American Standard Version.’ ” (For additional information see Lesson 70 m “Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, on Marriage, page 253 to 1 Tim. 4:1-3 on page 255.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 10 min: Local experiences on getting subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Demonstration on “Subscription Promises and Expiration Slips.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Stress importance of all sharing fully in “Watchtower” campaign. Often after sermon is given and subscription offer made, householder says: “I would like to have it, but I can’t take it now, maybe later.” Many are sincere in their expression. We should give such persons every opportunity to subscribe by following up. But how can we be reasonably certain they are sincere? Observe what an alert publisher does on encountering this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE I (3 min.) Publisher (using current sermon with an American Standard Version Bible) is talking to householder on last scripture and goes into subscription offer. Householder is favorable but does not have money now. Publisher offers two magazines for 10c and then tactfully asks when would be a good time to return for subscription. Householder sets time. Publisher says: “I’ll be happy to call back then. And while thinking about it, why don’t I write your name and address on this subscription slip now so as to have all the necessary information ready when I return?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Comments as to the many benefits of doing this: Usually only really interested persons will set a definite time and agree to have publisher fill out subscription slip; it is a ready record for publisher, etc. On making return call publisher should not say: “Hello, I’ve returned in regard to the subscription for ‘The Watchtower’ that you said you would like to take.” Rather, publisher should briefly rekindle interest of potential subscriber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE II (4 min.) Same publisher calls, saying: “Hello [name of householder]. You’ll recall I was here recently and we enjoyed discussing some Bible scriptures. Also, I was glad to leave with you copies of our Bible journals. Did you have opportunity to note on the cover of ‘The Watchtower’ [have one in hand] that it ‘Announces Jehovah’s Kingdom’? To many persons the name Jehovah is not a familiar term, even though it is in the Bible and is of greatest importance.” Refer to Psalm 83: 16-18, making appropriate comments; then explain how Jehovah is the “hallowed” name Jesus referred to in model prayer. (Matt. 6: 9) Purpose of “Watchtower” is to bring pertinent information to people regarding Jehovah’s kingdom. Then publisher produces slip made out on last call and obtains subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (1 min.) Our attention now turns to expiration slips. These should be distributed immediately upon receipt and calls made promptly. Do not merely call and say subscription has expired and may be renewed for $1. The following suggestion has been effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SCENE III (5 min.) “Hello. [If person is not known to you] Are you . . .? My name is . . . I’m calling on some ‘Watchtower’ subscribers to encourage further study of the Bible.” Go into current sermon. In conclusion bring out current “Watchtower” and comment on interesting points. Then advise householder you have noticed his subscription has expired and that you would be pleased to renew it for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Remember these are reported as new subscriptions. Summarize key points of demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Service talk on “Is Your Conscience a Sure Guide?” See “Watchtower” of September 15, 1957, p. 547. Service counsel pertinent to local congregation may be added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MARCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font10">min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Grand Increases During 1957.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among the many scriptures telling of increase in our day are Isaiah 9: 6, 7; 60: 8, 22. To Jehovah goes all the credit, even as indicated by such texts as Ps. 115: 1; Zech. 4: 6; 1 Cor. 3: 5, 6. Implicit, however, in such increase is the thought that God’s people have been zealous, faithful to their commission. To read of such increases, therefore, is encouraging to us, even as it was in Paul’s day.—1 Thess. 1: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Organized religion in the United States is proud of some 3-percent increase, but Jehovah’s witnesses world--wide had a 10-percent increase in the past year. And in the eight “Other Countries,” where the work has to be done underground, the increase was 15 percent! Among individual countries especially rejoicing in grand increase in recent years are Alaska (74), Fiji (87), Germany (164), Morocco, where in one year the publishers increased from 15 to 46 (212), and Uruguay, which has had almost thirtyfold increase in thirteen years’ (276) Comparisons with previous issues of the “Yearbook” show many other grand increases, as in. French Equatorial Africa and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">23 min: Demonstration on “Reaching Our Goal in April.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) The work ahead for April: 20-percent increase peak for month, all out for Memorial week-end and extra-special magazine activity. Will we meet our goals? What must be done? Watch and see. (As he talks, signs are posted showing 20-percent quota of publishers for congregation, last year’s local Memorial attendance, which they will try to exceed, and figure representing number of magazines congregation must place to average one a day for each publisher reporting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">DEMONSTRATION (18 min.) Congregation servant optimistically soliloquizes as he plans out work for April. Reflects on preparations already made to reach goals and what must be done in days ahead. Assistant congregation servant comes up. They discuss plans. As they look over publisher’s record card file, mention is made of prospects for reaching 20 percent through present potential and good-will persons ready to publish. Goal is in sight. Assistant will give study conductors list of those not reporting each week during April. He will check with conductors to see what they are doing to help irregular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bible study servant joins discussion. What will he do to help reach goals? He has prepared list of those being studied with and will contact those conducting' studies to see that they invite persons of good will to Memorial and April 6 public talk. Special emphasis will be placed on encouraging publishers to invite good-will persons to share in service during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Magazine-territory servant joins group and is asked what he will do to help congregation reach magazine quotas. He responds enthusiastically, telling of plans made for all territory to be covered with magazines during month. Sufficient magazines on hand so all publishers may reach quota of 30 magazines each and pioneers may place their minimum of 9 a day. Introductions will be taught publishers for use in placing special magazines. (He gives one or two he has worked up.) All-out magazine day on April 5 planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Group joined by representative study conductor. What will he be doing in April? Zealously he relates how he will use lists given him to check with publishers. He has arranged to contact irregular publishers and briefly tells of Scriptural admonition he will use to help them see need of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregation servant asks “average publisher” who joins group what he will do during April. He and all other publishers will be working to meet goals set, to start new ones in field service and co-operate with servants in making this best month yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Goals can be reached with Jehovah’s aid. “The heart of earthling man may think out his way, but Jehovah himself does the directing of his steps.” (Prov. 16: 9) All servant body fully behind effort and are confident all publishers will give their hearty support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Stirring talk on “Are You Ready for April’s Activity?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Arrange locally. [Include comments on text [Heb. 10: 24] at bottom of page 4.]</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant Meets with School Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Application of the principles learned in the school is more important than the exposition of them. In this connection it is observed that some school servants are neglecting to take the lead zealously in field service. Preparing for and giving constructive counsel is very important, but the school servant should always remember his more important obligation to teach publishers in the field service. He must share in the various features of the service regularly if he is to be in position to give this assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Early in March the congregation servant will meet with the school servant, after each has reviewed the duties of the school servant. They will discuss ways and means of improving his service to the brothers. Also, they will work together in the field.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The following outline will serve to guide the special meeting between</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Happy in Congregating</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses have good reasons for being happy; for is it not written: “Happy is- the people whose God is Jehovah”? (Ps. 144: 15) And is not a great international assembly of his people scheduled for this summer? These are reasons for happiness. When his people can come together in one grand gathering for eight days their happiness knows no bounds. They are thrilled to be with other happy ones congregated from many parts of the earth and to join their voices with them in songs of praise. Surely none of his people would prefer to stay home from such a great event. The good association, the edification, the spiritual food and the worship of our God in a united group will bring joy to the hearts of all who attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rooming (private, hotel, trailer city) and other* essential convention information will be published in sufficient time to care for your needs. It would be appreciated if all will await the information and not write now, making inquiries.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Use of the “American Standard Version”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version </span><span class="font11">is a reliable, literal translation that, for the most part, uses language common to our day. Translated in 1901, nearly 300 years after the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King James,</span><span class="font11"> it has taken advantage of the better understanding of Bible languages, and of improved texts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The most important advantage of this version over the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King James </span><span class="font11">is its use of the name Jehovah in the Hebrew Scriptures. We want the people to know the name of our God, and this translation with its correct rendering can help us. Other merits it has are its uniform translation of words such as “Sheol” instead of “grave,” “pit” or “hell” and the fact that many spurious passages and words have been deleted or corrected.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Many brothers find it practical to use this version in all features of the service and in giving public talks. Its modern paragraphing style rather than arbitrary verse arrangement makes it easier to read at the doors.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In view of all this, the Society recommends that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font11"> be used extensively in the field service. Where only the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King James</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font11"> versions are acceptable to the people, we may find it advisable to use them. But most ministers of Jehovah will find this complete Bible with its great number of superior, reliable and effective renderings best for general use in field service. While it is not better than the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> it is in one book, which makes it easy to use and carry in field service. Beginning March 1, the Society’s new thinner edition is only 90c for publishers and $1 for the public.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Change in Society’s Bible Prices</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As of March 1, 1958, the following Bibles published by the Society, that is, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Scriptures, </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font11"> (10) and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version(U), </span><span class="font11">will be placed with publishers at the rate of 90c each. (Congregations having any of these Bibles billed at the old rate may request credit March 1. State clearly on a literature credit request form how many of such Bibles you have so that your account may be credited.) Publishers will place these volumes with the public for $1.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential Qualities of Sermons Part 7: Coherence</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Just as cement and mortar hold well-arranged bricks in place to form sturdy buildings, so coherence ties words, sentences and thoughts together to form constructive, edifying sermons. So important is coherence that without it even the best material would fail to stick together, with this result: The householder probably would not get the point of your sermon or reach the desired conclusion. What, then, is coherence? Literally, it is a sticking together within. It implies a logical sequence of thought that can be easily followed by those of average intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Where does coherence begin? With the selection of appropriate material and the careful arrangement of it so it can be presented in proper sequence to its effective conclusion. You will observe that the scriptures in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> sermons all support one theme, thus lending themselves to coherence. One point is designed to blend right into the next, allowing for the theme to be accented and carried through to a successful climax. This is a must for persuasive argument.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Further, coherence is achieved by the skillful use of transitionals. These are words and phrases used to bridge the gaps that appear from one point to another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> To illustrate how coherence</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">April’s Activity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Coni’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> April is also a special month for magazine distribution with the April 15 and 22 issues. It can well be the month for an all-time peak of magazine placements, and it will be if all publishers place at least one magazine a day, pioneers six and special pioneers nine. The quota for the month of April is 30; 180 and 270.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> One more thing to keep before Jehovah in prayer is our desire for a 20-percent increase, which is 225,314 publishers. If we do our part, God will do his. The increase will be there, because It is “God who makes it grow.” Aid new ones to be regular preachers. Start persons studying out in the service during April. Get them to think and talk the truth. works let us analyze one part of the current sermon. The third scripture establishes the fact that Christ Jesus will destroy Satan. The fourth scripture outlines how he taught his followers to pray for the Kingdom. How can we bridge this gap effectively? After reading Hebrews 2:14, you might say: ‘Since we have the promise that Satan is to be destroyed, we can truly rejoice; for Jehovah will not only destroy Satan and wickedness but he will also bring in a new world of righteousness ; in fact, that is what we pray for when we say the Lord’s Prayer. So we can see how urgent it is to learn about the Kingdom ; and this very journal, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> announces that kingdom.’ Thus by the use of these transitional sentences the gap has been successfully closed and the material made to stick together in the person’s mind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Clearly, then, coherence is very necessary for a successful sermon. Without it the householder could not follow your discussion through to its proper conclusion. So use coherence wisely and let it play its vital role in improving your sermons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has promised to “teach the meek ones his way.” (Ps. 25:9) He is doing that through his theocratic organization. One of the instruments it is using is the ministry school. Since this is the month for the congregation servant to consult with the ministry school servant, it is a good time to consider how the school helps us “walk with God.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The instruction talk and student talks are a big help, as they refresh our minds on Scriptural material we have learned. An accurate understanding of this material is essential if we are to be efficient ministers. But for all to benefit, the students must prepare well.</span></p></li>

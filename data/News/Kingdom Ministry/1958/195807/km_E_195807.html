<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark1"></a>DIVINE WILL INTERNATIONAL ASSEMBLY</span></h1>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New York City, July 27 to August 3</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The attention and Interest of all of Jehovah’s witnesses at this time are directed to New York, even more specifically they are focused on Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds, which, for eight days, will be transformed into huge Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The question in the minds of all individuals should be, not, Am I going? but, Am I ready to go and are my plans completed? If you haven’t written for a room, take care of the matter right away, because there is still time to write and obtain an assignment. In the event accommodations are not received through the mail they may be obtained at Convention Headquarters, 77 Sands St., P.rooklyn, up to and including July 24. If you arrive on the 25th or 26th or thereafter, you should go to the Rooming department at Yankee Stadium in Section 46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Have your personal matters planned carefully so you can take full advantage of the entire assembly. Do not miss any part of it. Stay for the entire assembly and do not plan to leave until after the final talk, Sunday evening, 6 p.m. No trains, airplanes or buses will be scheduled to leave New York at hours that will jeopardize your staying until the convention is over.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> VOLUNTEER SERVICE : Many of the brothers are sending in Volunteer Service applications and indicating their desire to aid and assist in the convention to organize the work. Why not plan to join them in this labor of love by sending in your Volunteer Service application now. When you receive notice of your assignment, be dependable. Stick to it and render all service and work as to Jehovah. Please have in mind too that the volunteer service work is not over at the conclusion of the last talk, because there is a gigantic task of dismantling all the assembly equipment. Many helpers will lighten the task. So why not plan to stay Sunday night and Monday, and Tuesday, if possible, after the assembly to render much needed assistance in this respect. Be sure to bring appropriate clothing for your task.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> FIELD SERVICE : In addition to witnessing while en route to New York, each publisher should without fail include some preaching in his schedule while in New York. There will be the regular house-to-house ministry. Four mornings will be devoted to field service activity. Visit the bookroom for supplies. Then try door-to-door field service. Everyone will want to advertise the public talk. Some will do this by wearing a placard and giving out handbills, as five million will be printed for distribution ; others will share in magazine street-witness work. A field service instruction sheet is being sent with the June statements. Each congregation should consider it before leaving for the convention.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As dedicated servants of Jehovah you have responded to his question “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” as Isaiah did: “Here am I; send me.” (Isa. 6:8, 9, AS) Because of this agreement you will want to preach at all times.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Those who attend the assembly can preach on the way and after they arrive. Because most publishers will be gone, the brothers staying home should not consider this a reason to become silent. They can carry on with the regular offer for July.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Field service will emanate not only from Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds but also from seventeen strategically located Kingdom Halls throughout the city and one in New Jersey. You will be able to go directly to one of these contact points and arrange to get in several hours of field service. You may prefer going to the cafeteria at Yankee Stadium or the Polo Grounds in the morning, then getting territory. If this is the case, go early so you will not lose time. No time will be lost at the Kingdom Hall contact points, because you merely receive your territory and then your group can go directly to the field service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> You should retain your pink rooming card, and you will notice on the front side in the upper lefthand corner there is listed a territory number. The number is preceded by three letters. In the follow-</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Fulfilling the Commission to Go Preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk on “Fulfilling the Commission to Go Preach” and questions and answers on article “Fulfill Your Commission.” (See “Watchtower,” February 15, 1957, p. 113, and July 1, 1958, p. 392.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Question-and-answer coverage of paragraphs 1 to 15 of the convention article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Demonstration on “Witnessing en Route to and from the Convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Nationwide a tremendous witness will result as we travel to and from convention. Multitudes of autos will advertise with signs; chartered buses will bear identifying signs and on each delegate will be a lapel badge. In addition, and in more effective ways, publishers should be ready to witness to various persons with whom they come in contact, as Jesus did. (John 4: 5-26) What a mighty witness all this will produce’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (3 min.) Traveling by auto, publisher stops for gas. While car is being serviced, a brief discussion ensues and publisher tells attendant that car group is on way to New York to attend world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. So big that two stadiums will have to be used. From all parts of world people are going; to assembly to receive Bible instruction centering on God’s kingdom, the only hope of all mankind. Peace and prosperity to prevail on earth soon. Two Bible-study aids that have been of great help to all going to assembly are . . . (produce two books and make offer; if offer is not taken have two magazines ready for 10c).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (2 min.) Illustrate how conversation can be started at restaurant by speaking to waiters at appropriate time. One way to begin is: “I know you are busy and I don’t want to take up much of your time, but here is a tract that I am sure you will enjoy reading very' much. It discusses our need of the Bible in these difficult times.” Magazines can also be used in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE III (2 min.) Many traveling by bus, train and airplane. Demonstrate how a publisher can take the initiative and direct conversation to opportunity for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE IV (2 min.) Demonstrate how a witness can be given to a motel manager.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">10 min: 'Talk by congregation servant on “Be a Publisher in July.” June “Kingdom Ministry” pointed out that 219,000 publishers were needed each month to average 10-percent increase for service year. Need for all to be out in service in July. Encourage all to report before going to assembly. Also, do incidental witnessing at every opportunity, going to assembly, at assembly (plus regular witnessing in New York) and on the way home. Keep a record of time spent witnessing. If publisher will not be home by August 12, he should mail his report to congregation servant so he receives it by then. Since all will be at assembly through August 3, congregation servant need not submit July report for congregation till the 12th of August.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk by congregation servant on “Pay Attention to Things to Be Learned.” Point to text (Heb 2: 1) at bottom of page 4. Encourage all to take notes, having in mind use of information later for self and also for talking over points with those unable to attend. We come to assemblies to learn, must be attentive and listen carefully to all that is said. Supervise conduct of children so they also pay attention. Do not be distracted or visit during sessions. Be at all sessions and enjoy the grand sights at the stadiums rather than elsewhere in the city. Sight-seeing should be done other than at session hours. Listen carefully to all that is said and do not leave before dismissal. See “Watchtower,” July 1, 1953, p. 397, and May 15. 1958, p. 318; also, “Awake!” June 8, 1958.</span></p>

Publishers going to the assembly will be able to share in this work both before and after the assembly. Tell the joys and benefits of serving people living in unassigned territory and the need for wisely using available time in the territory to witness.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW JERSEY:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JCA, JEN, JFL, JFV, JHA, JPA, JPE, JPW, JTE, JPR .... 315 W. Palisade Ave., Englewood, N.J.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> TRAFFIC AND PARKING: All means of transportation will be used by the brothers coming to New York city. Room requests show 55 percent coming by automobile. Allow yourself plenty of time so that you can travel carefully and avoid accidents. Upon arriving in New York, observe traffic and parking signs. Parking regulations are enforced. There are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, col.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">International Assembly </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">many one-way streets, and these especially should be watched. If you need travel information watch for one of Jehovah’s witnesses Information Signs along the main arteries on your way to New York. These will be at gasoline filling stations. Gasoline is cheaper in New Jersey than in New York. It is in order to ask a policeman for directions. They will be courteous and helpful. The police department has strongly urged you to lock your automobile at </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font13">times and then never leave any valuables visible inside. If it is necessary to leave any of your apparel or other equipment in the car, be sure to put it in the trunk. Some neglected this counsel a few years ago and suffered the penalty of having their suitcases and other personal effects stolen. Parking places are extremely limited near and around both Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. What is available in commercial garages and parking lots is expensive, generally running from $1 to $2 a day. If you use such space, be sure the price covers twenty-four hours, or ascertain beforehand what the price is and when extra charges become effective. Prices and time periods are generally posted. Be sure you read them carefully. The advisable way to travel to and from your room is by subway or bus. The fare is 15c, which provides you the cheapest and fastest means of transportation. We urge that you park your car for the eight days (watch parking signs) near your room or drive to the subway and park it and use the subway or street public transportation. We recommend those staying in nearby New Jersey check local bus travel to subway transportation to either stadium.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> BUS : We expect to have a place where chartered buses can be parked, but it will be some distance from either Yankee Stadium or the Polo Grounds. Make definite arrangements for all your group before you get off your chartered bus on arrival for your bus departure after the assembly. Each bus should have a brother acting as a captain of the bus group. Each group must decide where to meet for departure after the assembly. No departures should leave before 9 p.m. (preferably later), giving ample time to stay for the full program. The proper and most suitable place to load for departure is at 161st Street near River Avenue, at Yankee Stadium, and 155th Street and 8th Avenue adjacent to the Polo Grounds. If you are in a group, be on time, so as not to keep your brothers waiting.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1 9</sup>TAXICABS: When using the taxicab transportation in New York, you should bear in mind that the price on the meter is the total fare, regardless of how many people are in the cab. No more is required unless you wish to tip the driver, which is customary and expected. There is no additional charge for ordinary suitcases that you may handle yourself in entering and departing from the taxicabs, but you will find an extra charge of 50c for each article when the taxicab driver places it in the trunk or handles it. Do not ride with the taxicab driver with the understanding that he is to take you to your destination for a flat rate and not using the meter. Such practice is illegal. Incidentally, the maximum load for any one vehicle is five passengers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> PROGRAMS : Obtain your copy at Yankee Stadium or Polo Grounds and then carry it with you at all times for reference to sessions as well as other information. Do not lose youb program or get copies for someone else. Each one will get his own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> FIRST AID : This department is set up to take care of emergency cases only. Chronic cases will not be treated by doctors present. If an individual needs special attention for chronic ailments, he should contact city doctors in the same manner that he would anywhere else.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">is CONVENTION DECORUM: Most of the brothers attending the convention will have traveled for many days to reach New York so as to assemble together. AU of us are spending much time, effort and money in order to be in attendance at all the meetings. Let us all be in our seats when the session begins. If the stadiums are filled, seats will not be held after the music begins at each session. If there are any articles left on the seats to hold the seats after that time, such articles will be taken to the Lost and Found department by the attendants, and other persons will be directed to those seats.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> In times past some have made a habit of leaving their seats before the session is over to avoid the crowd. This is inconsiderate of the rest in attendance that are anxious to obtain all the spiritual food that is presented on that occasion. Please refrain from this practice. There will be very few compelling reasons for anyone’s leaving any session early, including the evening session before the concluding prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> The objective in coming to the assembly is to obtain the greatest amount of spiritual benefit from it. This being the case, you will not be found milling around the passageways or through the concourses around the stadiums during the sessions. To be helpful to all and for the smoothness of operation of the entire assembly, please follow the directions of the attendants. It will be of no value for you to leave early to go to the cafeteria because the feeding lines will not be opened until the session has' been concluded.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">is CAFETERIA AND REFRESHMENTS : There will be a cafeteria at the Polo Grounds and also at Yankee Stadium. Similarly, there will be refreshment stands in operation at both stadiums and also in the tents on both parking lots. In addition to having the regular breakfast, dinner and supper meals, a snack lunch on a contribution of 35c will be served at the conclusion of the evening session at nine o’clock. Menus and refreshments will be the same at both stadiums.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> SURPLUS MATERIAL: Potted flowers at the platform of each stadium as well as surplus food items at the cafeteria kitchens will be disposed of at the conclusion of the assembly. Convention equipment, that is, cafeteria as well as public address equipment, w’ill be available to the circuits at the conclusion of the convention. However, in regard to the latter, when you come to the convention we would like you to place your order with the Trucking and Equipment department at either stadium, so proper arrangements and adjustments can be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> VISITING BETHEL AND THE FACTORY: Many will be interested in knowing that the factory at 117 Adams Street and the new building at 77 Sands Street and the Bethel Home at 124 Columbia Heights will be open for visitors Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 8 a.m. to 10: 30 a.m. You must be out of the buildings by 11: 30 a.m. so the brothers can get to the assembly on time, You are also invited to visit Gilead at South Lansing, New York, about 2(50 miles from New York city, if you wish, either before or after the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> MUSIC: Those who will be used in the orchestras at both Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds have been or are being notified directly by the Society. If you have not been notified by the Society of an assignment to the orchestra, do not bring your instrument or plan to share in the music department this year unless you .want to do so as a standby or substitute musician.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> However, we still need six to eight musicians that play French </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 4, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">International Assembly </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">horns in F and four bassoon players. If you play these instruments well, you may bring them with you and plan to share in the orchestra.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> BAPTISM: Candidates bring bathing suits and towels the morning of July 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> DEAF-MUTES: Interpreters for our deaf brothers will be located in Section 24 of the lower stands at Yankee Stadium and Section 18, lower stands, at the Polo Grounds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>23</sup> CONVENTION REPORT: This year the Society is preparing a complete convention report of 128 pages, including sixteen pages of pictures on special paper, which will be ready a short time after the convention is over. Congregation servants should order right away, so the Society will know how many to print. The cost is 30c each; it should be considered a cash item. Emphasize this now and get your order in before you leave for New York.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> TAPE RECORDINGS: Tape recordings will be available at both Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. The Society is happy to announce the tapes will be $4.00 each instead of $4.50 as announced in the June </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>25</sup> NO</span><span class="font13"> TRAILER CITY: The Society has worked diligently to locate a trailer- site, and at the same time obtain municipality permission. Such sanction could not be obtained. Consequently, there will be no trailer camp. Without question we should take it as a provision of Jehovah. It is apparently His will that all attend the convention at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. These facilities provide almost twice the seating and other necessities as enjoyed formerly in New York itself. Conveniences are much better than living in a trailer city. More importantly, those in attendance at the convention will derive much more spiritual benefit by attending in New-York, and actually being at the convention, than when they stayed at a trailer city before. There are far too many distractions and too many other disturbances that interfere while the talks and sessions are in progress at a trailer city. You will benefit far more by attending the convention in New York than you possibly could at a trailer city.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> When considering all costs to car, damage and extra gas, etc., in pulling a trailer- and staying at a trailer city, it is not always the most economical. Then too, it required (1950 or 1953) over an hour’s travel each way to and from the trailer city to New York and return, besides extra gas and tunnel tolls. No trailer city was set up for any of the district assemblies last year and everyone attended for five days. This is only three more days, and the increased cost slight.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>27</sup> We would suggest that those who may have waited for this final announcement of not having a trailer city write for accommodations that will take care of their needs. Consider, too, the great advantage you have by being able to accomplish a far greater witness in the homes of the people with whom you will be staying than when you stayed at a trailer city. Many accommodations are coming in at $1.00 to $1.50 per person per day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> Requests for trailer space are, therefore, automatically canceled. Any parking without obtaining a permit constitutes a violation in New York or New Jersey, except in licensed trailer parks. These are limited and generally filled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> YANKEE STADIUM OR POLO GROUNDS: Remember the same live program and same speakers will give talks at both stadiums, with very few exceptions. It will make no difference where you attend. Most will want to see both stadiums, but obviously the crowd will have to be divided. Beautiful speakers’ platforms will adorn the second base areas of both fields. Also, each will have its own fine orchestra.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY BE PRESENT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>30</sup> All loving Jehovah and desiring to serve him will do everything possible to attend the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York this summer. Recall the important announcement in the December 15, 1957, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> wherein it stated, “This may probably be the largest convention ever arranged for by the Watch Tower Society before Armageddon.” In all your convention activity and decorum, let it contribute to reflecting favorably upon Jehovah’s name in everything you do. It is His assembly for us, his people. Will you be included?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">NOTE : Take this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> to New York with you, read it on the way and refer to the instructions from time to time at the assembly. The assembly program will be most helpful too, so please read it carefully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">▼ Branch in Jamaica, West Indies, moved into newly constructed home in Kingston. The new branch is a beautiful two-story building, including a Kingdom Hall, local brothers helping put finishing touches on home and grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">▼ 300 attend circuit assembly in Ve-nustiano Carranza, Chiapas, Mexico. A waiting mob, expecting witnesses, attacks bus in which priest is traveling. On Friday, brothers disperse before mob arrives. Saturday, mob is dispersed by a cloudburst. Sunday, soldiers are on the scene to keep peace. Brothers use messengers to warn of mob’s approach. No one actually attacked, many good-will persons attend, in same circuit of Comitan reported on in 1/8/58 “Awake!” Jehovah gave the victory,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">▼ Brother in Ethiopia charged with baptizing Christian people and sentenced to five months' imprisonment. Before the district court he was asked whether the Orthodox Church was the true mediator. Because he denied this to explain that Christ is the only mediator, the judge sentenced him. Religious freedom guaranteed in this country, but brothers reports ‘‘Even if we appeal we will never win this case.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSPORTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Society has completed its air arrangements and announced them to those congregations affected. If your congregation has received no such announcement, it means the Society has been unable to arrange satisfactory air transportation from your area. We suggest you either go to the regular airlines or consider group train travel. All Watchtower Travel Committees will accept remittances for ticket orders for rail travel up until July 10.</span></p>

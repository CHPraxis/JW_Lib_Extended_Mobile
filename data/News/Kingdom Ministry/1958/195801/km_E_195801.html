</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> This is the day for increased praise to the One God, Jehovah. And it is not just increased praise in the United States; it is international praise that must be increased. The command is: “Praise Jehovah, ail you nations.” (Ps. 117:1) Increasing international praise to the One God—what a fitting theme for the beginning of the world-wide </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How can we increase international praise to Jehovah? Certainly not by being hermits. The Christian’s life should bring him in contact with strangers. “Do not forget kindness to strangers,” admonished the apostle. So we must miss no opportunity to show kindness by talking to strangers of Jehovah’s goodness, helping them to come to know the One God.—Heb. 13 : 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> To help these strangers respond to the command of Psalm 117:1, we must do a work of kindness, just as the kind Samaritan did. In this “time of the end” Satan’s highwaymen have beaten the masses and left them half dead. Who will come to their aid? “Happy is he who is showing favor to the afflicted ones.” Wiry? “He that is showing favor to the lowly one is lending to Jehovah, and his treatment he will repay to him.” —Luke 10: 29-37; Prov. 14: 21; 19: 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you wish to have the unspeakably thrilling privilege of lending to the Creator of the universe? Do you wish to do the most rewarding work there is on earth today, that of increasing praise to Jehovah? Then what opportunities open to you January 1, the beginning of the twentieth annual </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> campaign! You can show favor to the afflicted strangers and speed up recovery from their half-dead state by helping them receive regularly the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine. What “healthful words,” what spiritual food a year’s subscription brings I (1 Tim. 6:3) Look at the 1957 subject index in the December 15 issue! There is a feast of spiritual fat things ! There can be no doubt in our minds that the afflicted strangers need </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Will you help them?</span></p>

Since our desire is to increase international praise to the One God, the time has come to set new magazine quotas.—Ileb. 10:24; 1 Tim. 6:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Consider now the new quotas: For congregation publishers the quota is 12 magazines a month; for pio-contribution of $2, they may do so. Each publisher should use his own judgment as to whether or not to offer subscriptions for both magazines. If a person is already receiving </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake! </span><span class="font12">should be offered. Publishers will remit ninety cents for each new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> subscription throughout the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> To help us increase praise to Jehovah by showing kindness to strangers, we have a quota for the fourmonth campaign. For congregation publishers it is two; pioneers 20 and special pioneers 30. Last year’s campaign showed the reasonableness of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">neers it is 100 and for special pioneers it is 150.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> See how attainable the new quota is: Congregation publishers, for example, seek to place 12 a month —about three magazines a week. That really is not difficult. Why, by going into the field service before the congregation book study, you will usually be able to place more than three magazines I Likewise Magazine Day. Additionally, there are so many other opportunities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> So carry magazines with you at all times. Incidental witnessing, back-calling and the regular house-to-house work provide numerous opportunities. When you find persons who do not take the regular offer, present two magazines on a contribution of ten cents. One Sunday morning’s house-to-house service alone may easily afford opportunities to place more than three magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Individually, let us all strive to meet our new quotas. Do not depend on some other Kingdom minister to make up a deficiency for you. Do your share. Reach the quota, to the increased praise of the true God, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">In harmony with the new program for better servant leadership, this outline schedules assistant servants to make a report to the congregation.

<p><span class="font11">FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Increasing<sup>1</sup> International Praise to the One God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Talk on “Increasing International Praise to the One God.’’ (See “Watchtower,” October 15, 1957, p. 625, and January 1, 1958, p. 7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the main article “Show Kindness to Strangers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Develop and demonstrate a model sermon for the “Watchtower” campaign. A competent brother should be used as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Kingdom ministers need to be “fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” Are you ready for the “Watchtower” campaign? Now is the time to prepare an effective sermon. Multitudes blame God as the one responsible for world woes. The new sermon exposes Satan as the guilty one and points to Jehovah’s kingdom as the remedy.—2 Tim. 3: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PREPARING SERMON (15 min.) Chairman calls for suggestion or two from audience as to appropriate introduction that could be used with sermon below and then have a panel discuss and develop the sermon. In conclusion have suggestions from the audience, especially on going from concluding scripture text into presentation of the “Watchtower” subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Theme: Who Is Responsible for World Woes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your introduction might begin this way: “Good morning. I am Mr.---, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Mrs.----, a minister, doing a public</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">service in your neighborhood. Have you ever wondered why almost all the news we get today is bad? Who do you think is responsible for these terrible conditions in the world? Some people blame God. They say that he is punishing the world for its wickedness. But is God to blame? It is interesting to note what the Bible has to say on this point:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Not God, but Devil is responsible one. He is misleading whole world</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■—Rev. 12: 9, 12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Satan controls world—Luke 4: 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Promises to destroy Devil—Heb.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">2: 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Taught followers to pray for God’s kingdom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Matt. 6: 9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">In conclusion tell how the purpose of “The Watchtower” is to announce Jehovah’s kingdom, which is why they need it. The magazine opens up before them the hope of a better world on a paradise earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">DEMONSTRATION (5 min.) Publisher selected beforehand gives model sermon and householder takes offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Stress importance of all sharing in house-to-house service and being well prepared to give sermon. This subject is of keen interest to many people. Would be well for publishers to review chapter on “Satan the Devil” in the book “Let God Be True” and “Your Word Is Truth” in October 22, 1957, issue of “Awake!” for additional talking points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: Talk and audience participation on “New Magazine Quotas.” This talk should stress the value and reasonableness of the magazine quotas and give helpful information on ways publishers may reach their quota. Suggestions from the audience will also be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration by the school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk on “Supporting Kingdom Service.” Include accounts servant’s report. (If a sister is accounts servant, she could relate points of discussion under direction of the chairman.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Heb. 13: 15] at bottom of page one.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">THIRD MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text and comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: New World News report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Literature servant’s report. (If literature servant is a sister, she could be interviewed by congregation servant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: Talk on “Literature Placements a Means to an End.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Talk on “Doing Right Christian Works.” (See “Watchtower,” November 1, 1957, p. 645.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FOURTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: In “Make Sure of All Things” cover from “The Channel Through Which God’s Love Is Expressed to Us,” page 251, to John 21: 15-17 on page 252. To be handled as a call made by one of the congregation committee upon a brother who is staying away from meetings because of being offended at what another brother said or did. Or cover by question-and-answer method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22 min: Demonstration on the value of the “Yearbook” and calendar to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Talk on value and benefit of “Yearbook” to all. Opening pages set theme for coming year and give resume of past year’s activities. Accuracy of report in chart depends on each publisher. So all have part in “Yearbook.” Reports in congregation help make national total in each country. Views from various branches show how internationally Jehovah’s witnesses are a nation of praisers to Jehovah. Helps us appreciate worldwide unity of Jehovah’s organization. In Bethel homes throughout world text is discussed each morning, a couple of questions are asked on the text and members of the family are called on for their comments. Much spiritual maturity is result of consistently starting day this way. Watch how this can be done in family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE I (6 min.) Setting is theocratic home with family gathered at breakfast table. Father looks at calendar for date, makes brief comment on calendar picture, reads text and calls for questions from family. Young son asks question on point he does not understand. Father asks others for comment. Daughter of high-school age has looked up point and offers comment. Mother too gives Scriptural reason. Father asks young son for own thought. He replies that now he understands and gives comment showing he has grasped the points made. Father sums up points in text. Comments from “Yearbook” read and mention made that report from a branch will be read and discussed at evening meal. All look forward to discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SCENE II (8 min.) Audience discussion. Chairman calls for expressions from audience on value of “Yearbook” to them. Different thoughts expressed, such as: much knowledge gained through daily reading and discussion of text (just 5 to 10 minutes a day would mean 30 to 60 hours of study a year); better understanding of new truths expressed in past year; expressions from brothers in other countries on overcoming problems in field service and meeting situations in divided homes most helpful; sisters whose husbands not in truth find interesting experiences enjoyed by mates and interest is aroused to know more; experiences used to help persons of good will we study with to see need of association with organization and to preach; others may mention value in preparing talks, etc. (It may be well for the chairman to assign brothers these various points in advance so that they will be brought out during the discussion.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Recounts points made. Like all other theocratic endeavors we get out only what we put into it. As we sow, so we shall reap. (Gal. 6: 7, 8) Daily use the “Yearbook” to advantage and benefit spiritually, coming to deep appreciation of Jehovah’s Word and organization. Also, point out the value of the new calendar and how it is an incentive to cause us to remember our brothers in concentration camps, in Asiatic countries, attending the international convention in New York and those in faraway places doing magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">13 min: Service talk on “This Is the Year.” Include material pertaining to local congregational matters and increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on text [Heb. 10:23] on bottom of page four.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FIFTH MEETING IN JANUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Congregations having a fifth meeting should arrange their own program.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant Visits with Literature and Accounts Servants</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Like the human body, an organization is made up of many parts, all functioning smoothly together. As Paul said: “There should be no division in the body” if it is to work effectively. The literature and accounts servants perform essential services in each congregation organization. The goal of all congregation servants and literature and accounts-servants during January will be to see if they can improve their efficiency to create a more effective, smooth-working organization to Jehovah’s praise.—1 Cor. 12:12-27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Some time prior to their meeting, all three servants should go over the material in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity, Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> and other publications of the Society pertaining to accounts and literature. The three will then meet together at a convenient time and have their discussion, using the following outline as a basis: (1) Check records. (Auditing of accounts to be done at another time.) (2) Ordering of literature so as to have ample on hand</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The 1958 public address outlines are being sent with this </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> so that the brothers may have ample time to give careful thought and preparation to them. The titles are: Which Religion Really Matters? What Did Christ Ransom? Why Zionism Must Fail, Should Worldly Science Weaken Your Faith? What’s This World Coming to? Testing the Holy Trinity’s Foundations, Why Spiritual Famine in Time of Plenty? Is Everlasting Life Only a Dream? It would be advisable for congregation servants to consider paragraphs 133 and 134 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity </span><span class="font12">before making the assignments. They will want to be careful to select qualified speakers who are capable of giving a talk that is interesting and instructive to persons not in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The new public talk for circuit servants will be “Meeting the Needs of Life-Seekers,” starting March 2. In February the district servants will begin the new talk “Facing the Future Without Fear.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">but not to overstock. (3) Care of literature, to keep clean and protected. (4) Co-operation between two servants and co-ordinating of work. (5) Promptness of handling subscriptions. (6) Closing out records promptly at end of month and forwarding remittance and credit request to Society. (7) Field service activity of servants and support of training program through service centers to which assigned. (8) Counsel on improving service before and after meetings. (9) Discuss any local problems.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> With both servants being present at the discussion with the congregation servant, they will become better acquainted with each other’s duties and will better understand how the two departments can co-operate together. The overseer should direct the discussion in such a way that places for improvement will receive attention and not too much time will be spent on nonessentials or minor points. The congregation servant will work with each of these servants in the field, and the meeting with them should be early in the month.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Public Meetings Held: 14,215</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">UNITED STATES QUOTA FOR 1958 206,538 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Placements a Means to an End</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> report shows that world-wide we placed over 18 million books and booklets, more than 76 million individual magazines and obtained more than one and a quarter million subscriptions during the 1957 service year. Why do we endeavor to place literature with the people? Because we want them to learn about Jehovah and his kingdom and get on the road that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But for this literature to serve its purpose it must be read and understood. That means that we must call back and stimulate interest in the literature and then aid people to understand it. If we fail to do that we miss the very purpose of our placing the literature in the first place, which is thus seen to be merely a means to an end. The same is even true of our subscriptions. Unless we encourage them to read and help them to understand the magazines, it may be that after a few issues they won’t even take the trouble to remove the magazines from their wrappers. So, let us never forget, placing literature is only a means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Praise ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">this quota: Congregation publishers averaged 1.7; pioneers 19.2 and special pioneers 29.8. That was fine.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What can you do to reach the quota? Remember where subscriptions mostly come from—the house-to-house ministry. So benefit from the new sermon outlined in “Your Service Meetings.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> What can congregations do to aid all to reach their quotas? At service centers and service meetings helpful suggestions may be presented. At the Kingdom Hall the congregation servant might arrange for a chart to show the week-by-week progress. Overseers should outline a program to cover the entire territory with the offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> And let us not forget that kindness must be directed not only to strangers but to our friends and brothers: “Become kind to one another.” Those who started in the service during December need our kindness. Assist them.—Eph. 4: 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Forward, then, into the rewarding opportunities January brings! Use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to comfort those oppressed by the Devil. Yes, deal rewardingly with your own soul: Show kindness to strangers and thereby join in with Kingdom ministers world-wide, who are using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to increase international praise to the One God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential Qualities of Sermons Part 4-—Tactfulness</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus, the great Exemplar, gave good counsel on one of the prime requisites for quality sermons, namely, tactfulness. He said: “Prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.” This meant that they must be tactful. Paul also declared : “But a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be tactful toward all.” But precisely what does it mean to be tactful? Tactfulness may be defined as: a sensitive mental perception; or an acute, keen discernment of the best course of action to take under given conditions; or the peculiar ability to deal with others without giving offense. Tact is knowing what to say, how to say it and when to say it. —Matt. 10:16; 2 Tim. 2: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Hence, the importance and value of being tactful is seen at once. It has many benefits to offer. Its proper use will aid us to go far in giving our sermons and will help us to reach the objective. It will help us to get oui- information across to the householder without offending him and closing his mind to the message. Tactfulness should not be confused with compromise or deceit. We can go too far in. the matter of tact and become overtactful, servile, apologetic, even compromising the truth, which would be wrong, the same as being untactful. So strike a happy balance and use the right amount of tact at the proper time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Supporting Kingdom Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As dedicated Christian ministers all we have belongs to Jehovah. We are merely stewards, obligated to make the best possible use of everything entrusted to our care, not only of our time and strength, but also of our money. As noted in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> March 1, 1955, we have privileges and obligations to give support to our local congregation, to the Society and to needy brothers, especially those serving full time. And until the big convention next summer, we all have an added privilege and obligation along this line, namely, to contribute toward bringing as many missionaries and other fulltime servants as possible to that convention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> A few examples perhaps will aid us to see the point clearly. We may meet a householder who says, “I’m a Catholic and I’m not interested in your work.” You could counter with, “I’m glad to know that you are a Catholic. We have at least one thing in common—we both see the importance of spreading religion in this delinquent world.” Such a statement is both truthful and tactful. You are glad to know that he is a Catholic, for that will aid you to adapt your presentation to appeal to him and at the same time you acknowledge his objection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Another illustration would be the householder who says, “I’m busy.” In all sincerity you could say, “But you shouldn’t be too busy to listen to the message I have for'you.” That would be truthful, but not tactful. It would be better to tactfully acknowledge we live in a busy world and then point out that even in a busy world we must pause to think about God and his purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> So always work for a tactful presentation. Think of what you say and how you say it. Think in terms of the householder’s reaction.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Here it is ! A new year, a special year I Why? Because of the greatest international assembly Jehovah’s modern-day witnesses will have ever held. Imagine! Two big stadiums for one gathering of God’s people. And think of the rich spiritual food that will be served.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This great assembly will certainly open the eyes of many who now sit in darkness. “The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.” (Isa. 9:2) This is the year for the light</span></p></li></ul>

This is the year to make it the greatest of all, as an appropriate match for the greatest assembly. And what about a new peak of 225,314 publishers in April? These two great achievements, along with a big Memorial attendance, would be the finest kind of introduction for the climax of the year—the assembly. Indeed, we can expect this to be a great year with great things for Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li></ul>

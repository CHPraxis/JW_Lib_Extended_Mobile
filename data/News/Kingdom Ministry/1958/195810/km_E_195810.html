<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Share in world-wide distribution of October 15 “Watchtower”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a stimulus Jehovah’s people have had to stay awake to the Kingdom ministry! The Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses has powerfully aided us to heed the counsel of this month’s theme text, 1 Corinthians 16:18, 14: “Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty. Let all your affairs take place with love.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How can we be awake to the Kingdom ministry in October? By participating fully in the distribution of the special October 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> which contains the absorbing public lecture “God’s Kingdom Rules —Is the World’s End Near?” by widely advertising the October 5 public lecture, and by offering people of good will subscriptions for both </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> To stimulate distribution of the special issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">special emphasis should be placed on Magazine Day service, and on magazine distribution before the congregation book study and at every other opportunity. Book study conductors would do well to discuss the prospects with their groups and then organize for increased activity during October in co-operation with the congregation servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What blessings good-will persons receive by having both magazines regularly coming to their homes I This month we want to stress the two-subscription offer. How can we do this? When offering the magazines present them in such a way that the householder understands that both magazines are vital. We must start with the right mental attitude ourselves. Be positive. Do not think that one’s territory is unsuitable for the two-subscription offer. People of good will in all territories will respond to the offer. But we need to present it in the right way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Show that the two magazines go together. Offer them, not as separate subscriptions for $1 each, but rather as two subscriptions for $2. Yes, offer two subscriptions as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font11">unit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Give the householder adequate reasons for subscribing for the magazines. Merely commenting on an article in each magazine is usually not enough. On completion of the sermon lead into the offer on the basis of the theme in which you have already stimulated interest. Then give the householder an overall picture of what he will be getting by subscribing for both magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Explain that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">makes a study of God’s Word. &quot;Use the October 15 issue effectively in obtaining subscriptions. State that it is receiving world-wide distribution. Stress that this lecture that thrilled more than a quarter million people is just the beginning of many convention talks to be published in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> By subscribing now the householder will not miss any of these talks explaining the divine will for our day. Mention other features of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> too.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OFFER FOR OCTOBER</span></a></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Show that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> complements </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. Awake!</span><span class="font11"> draws attention to world events in the light of fulfilled Bible prophecy. A brief way to give an over-all picture of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> is to refer to “The Mission of This Journal” on page two. It is not necessary to use all your points at each door. Rather, be alert to the needs of each householder and select points accordingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> When the householder does not take the offer, drop to one subscription for $1. If no subscription is taken, offer two magazines for a contribution of ten cents. At every house there is one thing we want to leave—a copy of the special October 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Think what a witness to the established Kingdom will be accomplished!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> During October every congregation publisher should try to obtain at least one subscription; pioneers, five, and special pioneers, eight. View these quotas in their<sup>1</sup> true light. It is not a mere quota we are seeking to meet but it is this: We have vital information, the message of the Kingdom, and we as individuals want to bring this message to the people, by helping them obtain subscriptions to both magazines. By so doing we aid persons of good will to gain life in the new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> To meet the quota let all publishers engage in as much house-to-house work as possible. Follow through on promises. Be certain that persons who already know of the Kingdom good news are given the opportunity to subscribe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Stay awake to the Kingdom ministry by giving the fullest support to the October 5 public meeting. So that as many persons as possible may learn that God’s kingdom rules, the lecture deserves effective advertising. For best results keep these three points in mind: (1) Let each publisher extend invitations both to persons of good will that they serve and to friends and neighbors. (2) Let publishers work in territory that is readily accessible to the hall where the lecture will be given. (3) In addition to being present himself, let each publisher make it his personal goal to bring at least one other person to the lecture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Stay awake to the Kingdom ministry by sharing fully in the great work October sets before us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">FIRST MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Staying Awake to the Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">8 min: New World News Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Talk on “Staying Awake to the Kingdom Ministry.’’ (See “Watchtower,” 3/1/57, p. 145, and 10/1/58, p. 603.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12 min: Question-and-answer coverage of the main article “Stay Awake to the Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">13 min: Talk on High Points of the Field Service for October, Novembei' and December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [Rom. 12:11] at bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: “Yearbook” experiences about subscription campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The value of a subscription for “The Watchtower” is brought home to us by an experience from Australia. (85) How much interest just one “Watchtower” magazine can arouse can be seen by the reports from Germany (165), Indonesia (185) and Colombia (120). How effective an “Awake!” magazine can be, whether a single page, one issue or a subscription, can be noted from the reports from Senegal (162), Peru (237) and Sumatra (186). And as for'activity with the special issue, one special pioneer placed almost a thousand copies (268), while in Germany a person of good will was so impressed she asked for ten to twenty copies more of the special issue to pass out to her friends. (165) Truly our threefold campaign for October should prove to be most interesting and fruitful in every way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Report from assistant congregation servant on visit with congregation servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Questions and answers and demonstrations on “Know Your Magazines.” (Advise publishers on previous week to be prepared to participate.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Talk about the good results that come from magazine distribution and what the congregation has been doing in this feature of the work during .the last few months. Encourage the publishers to make October a record magazine month. The goal for each congregation publisher is one subscription; for each pioneer, five subscriptions, and for each special pioneer, eight subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(8 min.) Divide audience into two groups. Propound a question to the first group regarding a point in the current issue of “Awake!” If the answer is not given promptly, turn to the other group and let them answer. Then give this second group the first chance to answer the next question. Frame the questions so that they will bring out talking points that can be used in presenting the “Awake!” either on Magazine Day or with the two-subscription offer. It is best to make up questions from three or four articles. Then publishers who have prepared in advance should be called on to give several thirty- to sixty-second presentations that demonstrate how the points can be used effectively in Magazine Day presentations. Although “Awake!” is the magazine being featured in the presentation, “The Watchtower” should be presented as its companion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(12 min.) Propound questions to the | audience on articles in the special “Watchtower” in the same manner as was done with “Awake!” The chairman might include among his questions one that asks for the points in the magazine that would appeal to a busy housewife or a workingman, or he might ask how certain local objections to the magazines might be overcome. Have two publishers demonstrate brief Magazine Day presentations using these points. Here “The Watchtower” should be featured, and “Awake!” will be presented simply as its companion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now have two model demonstrations showing how to present the two-subscription offer as conclusions to the current sermon. Keep in mind the suggestions offered in the main article and “Presenting the Good News.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(3 min.) Chairman reviews some of the practical suggestions given during the program and encourages the publishers to use them in the field. He reminds them to call back on all subscription promises as well as expiration notices. Even though such calls take time, it is time well spent. (See the March 1958 “Kingdom Ministry” for ideas that appeared in the demonstration on “Subscription Promises and Expiration Slips.”)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, page 265, Women May Be Ministers, to Heb. 13:15 on page 267. To be handled by audience participation, questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Report on 1958 Blessings in Your Congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">25 min: Discuss and demonstrate new back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Using local information on average back-calls and Bible studies, number in congregation participating in back-call work, in Bible study work, etc., chairman emphasizes need for preparing and using back-call sermons. Effective sermons result in home Bible studies. So all can use sermons Society publishes effective ones. Goal is at least two thirds of publishers conducting studies. Use sermons to reach this goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">DISCUSSION WITH AUDIENCE (11 min.) Following sermon should be listed on blackboard or printed on card large enough for audience to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Theme: Hope for the Dead</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Resurrection hope for those remembered by God —John 5:28,29</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Jesus’ resurrection makes promise sure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—1 Cor. 15:20-22</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Righteous and unwillingly unrighteous to be raised —Acts 24:15</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Wicked ones will not return</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">—Prov.10:7</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">5. Available to those who show faith by obedience &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 3:36</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. Hope for obedient ones now living never to die &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—John 11:25,26</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Success in making calls may depend on how we introduce sermon, making transition from previous visit. Introductions generally framed around previous conversation with householder. Should be enthusiastic, friendly and display genuine interest in presenting additional scriptures to build up hope for dead. Chairman calls for suggested introductions from audience. Scriptures in sermon next discussed with audience, with appropriate connectives between them all outlined. Theme of “Hope for the Dead” should stand out in mind of good-will persons. Show through discussion how to lead into publication to be studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SERMON (12 min.) Previously prepared publisher is called on to give model sermon. If you call the person of good will by name and greet him in a friendly way, you will often be invited right in. However, if the householder hesitates, you might say: “In view of our interesting discussion of a few days ago on the condition of the dead, I looked up some additional scriptures that show what hope there is for persons after death. May I step in and talk to you about them for a few minutes?” Suggest that the householder get his Bible. “In our previous discussion we learned that the dead are asleep, not alive in another world. The wonderful hope that Jehovah God holds out for the dead is a resurrection. John 5:28, 29 speaks of that hope; let’s turn to it in the Bible.” In going from the sermon to the publication, publisher might say, “The provision of eternal life for persons wno are righteously disposed, whether living or dead, is discussed clearly in the book ‘Let God Be True’ [or whatever publication is placed] that I placed with you. Here on page 272 [‘This Good News of the Kingdom’, paragraph 18; ‘This Means Everlasting Life’, page 288] it shows that many wonder about life after death, and it raises the question [on paragraph 2] as to where a person would look for the correct answers to questions about the hope for the dead. What would you say?” Then briefly discuss paragraph before chairman cuts in with concluding remarks on wisdom of all using sermons to start home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Concluding comments. (Include comment on text [1 Thess. 5:6] at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FOURTH MEETING IN OCTOBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">10 min: Talk on “Youthful Ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Congregator urges children to remember their Creator in the days of their youth. And even as God’s Word gives us such examples as Jesus, Samuel, Jeremiah and Timothy, so our 1958 “Yearbook” gives us modern-day examples. The report on British Guiana (102) tells of a very effective doorstep sermon being given by a youthful minister, while a report from Iceland tells of how successful such a one can be in placing magazines. (79) That youthful ministers can do much good by witnessing to their schoolmates and chums is shown in the reports from Faroe Islands (144), Netherlands (214) and South Africa (250). One Italian miss started a study with her professor (188), and one Nigerian youth explained the truth so well that a clergyman expressed admiration for his knowledge of the Bible. (205) Truly, youth is no barrier to fruitful witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">20 min: “Presenting the Good News.” To be conducted by the school servant. Demonstrate or illustrate points being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15 min: Talk on “Assembly Resolution to Be Widely Distributed.” 10 min: Concluding comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">FIFTH MEETING IN OCTOBER Arrange locally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Direct Relationship of Theme to the Literature Offer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 11</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> By means of striking introductions Jehovah’s ministers are able to arouse interest in their sermons, but more than a striking introduction is needed to convince a householder that he needs one of our Bible-study aids. The sermon must stick to a theme and then the literature must be tied into that theme. It will then be clear to the householder that he needs this literature to learn more about what was told him in the sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers give good sermons but fail to tie the literature offer to the theme. They may have excellent transitions between scriptures but still fall short of having a good transition from the sermon to the literature presentation. It requires preparation to keep your theme to the fore when presenting the literature. You must take the time to search through the publication for specific points that would fit your theme. Sometimes the title of a chapter or the title of the publication itself may be used in addition to these points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We might take the current sermon “Condition of the Dead” as a</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Overseer Meets with Assistant Congregation Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During October the overseer will begin a recheck of the congregation organization. He will meet with the assistant congregation servant for the purpose of reviewing his duties and ascertaining where improvements need to be made in building up the congregation. Both servants will find it profitable to go over the points outlined in the October, 1957, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> page 3. Each of the eight points listed there should receive attention. Special attention should be given to (1) the 1st- and the 15th-of-the-month checkup lists, which the assistant congregation servant furnishes the book study conductors, and (2) how he can be of the greatest assistance to the congregation servant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What should be on this checkup list that is given to the conductors? Not just a column of names of those that have not gone out in service up to a particular date. It should have means to illustrate how the literature offer can be tied in with the theme. Upon concluding the sermon you might say: “The resurrection hope is comforting, isn’t it? Additional information about this divine provision is set forth on this page of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine.” Then show the householder page 638 of the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> when you are using that issue. Draw his attention specifically to paragraph 50 of the article “God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When using the October 8 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> you might draw the householder’s attention to the article “World Peace in God’s Way” and then point out the paragraph in which John 5:28, 29 is quoted. In this manner the theme of our current sermon is emphasized when presenting these magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> By clearly demonstrating that your sermon has a direct relationship with the literature you present, you are helping people “get saved” by creating in them a desire to have that literature and to study it. It is a right desire because it means the gaining of accurate knowledge of God, and that, in turn, leads to eternal life.—1 Cor. 10:33.</span></p></li></ul>

The assistant should explain to the conductors how these lists can be best used. The congregation servant should check the over-all arrangement and give appropriate counsel where necessary. The two servants in their meeting should discuss how to apply the Society’s suggestions to local circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The congregation servant should be informed weekly as to the progress of the congregation in the ministry.

<p><span class="font11">Again this year it is recommended that all congregations and publishers arrange for special Magazine Day activity on worldly “Thanksgiving Day.” Two order blanks are being sent to congregations so they can order the extra copies of the November 22 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> and the December 1 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> that they will need.

<p><span class="font11">As announced by Brother Knorr at the Divine Will assembly, the study of the new book is to be started the first of October at all congregation book studies.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York city a forceful resolution was adopted by all present. Since then hundreds of thousands of our brothers in other lands have just as enthusiastically passed this same resolution, all wanting the world to know their stand for Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In brief, concise statements the Resolution sets out clearly the beliefs of God’s servants, their position as to politics and false religion, and their determined declaration to keep preaching that God’s kingdom rules. The nations of the earth must know of this resolute stand so that those of good will may appreciate the position that Jehovah’s witnesses have taken.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> With Jehovah’s blessing the message will first be distributed through millions of copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> The excellent speech of the Society’s vice-president introducing the Resolution and the Resolution itself, along with other interesting articles, will be published in the November 1 English edition. Congregations should immediately order extra supplies of this edition to the number they feel they can distribute. These orders for extra copies should be placed at once.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The distribution of the November 1 issue will begin in October. So this should make the October campaign outstanding, and you will carry on the distribution of this November 1 issue through the early part of November until all your distributors’ copies and additional orders are placed with the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The special world-wide distribution will next begin on December 1</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “Shout in triumph to God, all [you people of] the earth. Make melody to the glory of his name. Render his praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:1) Did we shout triumphantly during April? Did we sing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> glorious melody to the praise of his name? Yes! And even in March great was our joy with 206,883 publishers in the field. It was the first month in the service year we had attained the 10-percent increase. But then a mighty shout of praise, .a powerful surge of song broke forth during April with 226,797 in the field, a 20.8-percent increase. What glory to Jehovah’s name! A splendid report and great cause for rejoicing. This means there were 18,537 .more singers of the new song in one month than ever before. Also, last year only 1,538 congregations made it, whereas this year 1,669, or 44 percent, reached the goal of 20-percent increase by April. Well done, faithful Kingdom ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Then, too, your fine efforts in connection with the Memorial and the special public meeting brought excellent results. Outstanding was this week of praise to the composer of the new song. Consider the report as compared with the one from last</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> But this is not all. Consider further the magnificent effort put forth in distributing the special magazines. Here, too, it is evident that we have great cause for rejoicing, for we placed 5,394,910, this compared with 4,724,095 represents a 14-per-cent increase.

What are you doing to help the sheep of God to flee to the only place of safety, namely, the new system of things that Jehovah has created?

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Jesus urged people not to pursue selfish interests, but to work for God—“for the food that remains for life everlasting.” They then asked him: “What shall we do to work the works of God?” Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that you responsibility is ours to discharge.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> In the months ahead we should concentrate on achieving a 10-percent average increase for the service year. The prospects are thrilling, but to accomplish this we need to average 219,000 publishers each month for the next four months. Each congregation servant should now determine what his congregation needs to average each month to gain this goal. Then, by proper organization and sufficient effort, we should be able to do it. May Jehovah continue to bless us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">exercise faith in him whom that one sent forth.” Jesus meant for them to disown themselves and their selfish pursuits, to surrender their lives for the sheep by following him continually. All other work is vanity. —John 6:27-29; 10:11; Matt. 16: 24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> How best can we find and care for the sheep? A house-to-house search for the sheep is not only the best but the God-ordained way. It is a vital feature of a Christian’s ministry.—Acts 5:42; Matt. 7: 7.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Calling back where interest is manifested is an important part of your ministry. It is God’s way of feeding the sheep. Placing&quot; the June offer—two books and two booklets on a contribution of $1—should compel you to call back. Make notations of all placements, what subject was discussed and return while the experience is still fresh in their minds.

<p><span class="font7">22 min: Demonstration on “New York Assembly Reminders.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Time for world assembly rapidly approaches. Publishers admonished to work out and complete arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE I (8 min.) Servant visiting home of newer publisher family that has never attended an International assembly. Convention plans are enthusiastically discussed; also car group arrangements, route of travel, time of travel, etc. Conversation goes to rooming. Servant-has submitted his request, but newer family has not, as they have not decided whether to stay in hotel or private home. Servant comments choice up to them; however, Society’s letter of April 3 to all congregations pointed out the good that can be accomplished by staying in private homes. After brief discussion family decides to stay in private home. Servant suggests they fill out Room Request form and send it in immediately, as brothers in New York must have forms to know needs. Next, discussion goes to privilege, pleasure and need to volunteer service. All want to serve and will send in applications right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE II (4 min.) Publisher family and servant at Kingdom Hall couple weeks later. Family has received rooming assignment card and so has servant. Servant discusses with family value of writing a letter to householder right away, acknowledging receipt of rooming assignment from Society, giving anticipated date of arrival and how much publisher is looking forward to attending assembly and staying with householder. Publishers should plan time of arrival at householder’s address in New York during day or early evening, not in middle of night. On arrival in New York it is suggested a call be made (if householder has a telephone) to let householder know you are in the city and will soon be at the home. If householder has phone, the number will be on assignment card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SCENE III (4 min.) Servant and head of publisher family meet at cafeteria, where both are assigned to serve as attendants. As they relate experiences of finding rooms, etc., their wives (both assigned to work in kitchen) approach and join in discussion. All are pleased with rooming accommodations, etc. Householder where family is staying has shown good interest in truth and expressed desire to attend some of convention, particularly Sunday public meeting. All happily comment on blessings being enjoyed by staying in private homes and of volunteering services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Encourage brothers to follow through on points brought out in demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Col. 3:2] at bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">time in Jehovah’s work. The evenings in June are excellent and with more daylight hours to do prestudy magazine work and engage in the back-call activity, these features of service should show a marked increase. “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Be slaves to Jehovah.”—Rom. 12:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 7 min: New World News Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">10 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, on Mass, page 257, to Heb. 9: 15-20 on page 258. To be handled by question-and-answer method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Combination talk and questions and answers on “Feeding the Lambs Through the Congregation Book Studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk on “You Can Be a Good Listener.” See “Awake!” June 8, 1958, p. 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">8 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FOURTH MEETING IN JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5 min: Welcome, text, comments. 12 min: Talk on “Perseverance Results in Studies and Publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wisely the Scriptures stress perseverance, for perseverance brings results. (Gal. 6:9; Eccl. 11: 6) And this is especially seen to be true regarding our home Bible studies, as noted by our “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus by persevering a Tunisian brother was able to start a study with one who in just a few months became a publisher, was baptized and is now arranging his affairs to pioneer. (162) Because Moroccan brothers persevered in making friendly calls upon a subscriber to both magazines who had cooled off, a study was started with that one, who also soon became a publisher. (212) For a similar experience by brothers, in Sierra Leone, see page 246. By “keen persistence in making return calls” a Northern Rhodesian brother succeeded in starting a study with a headman, on which study a Roman Catholic priest sits in. (225) And, of course, we must persevere after we have started a study if we would get results, as a missionary in Haiti found. (175)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min; Talk by Bible study servant, covering congregation’s Bible study activity. Include suggestions for improvement. Allow time for experiences from audience on various features of Bible study activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15 min: Talk- on “Have You Been Baptized?” Upon reaching the age of mannood under the law Jesus lost no time in being baptized in symbol of his dedication. No sooner had the Ethiopian eunuch become persuaded that Jesus was the Messiah than he likewise was ready to be baptized. And Saul of Tarsus promptly heeded the call of Ananias.—Matt. 3: 15; Acts 8: 36; 22: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet today, in the United States alone, some fifty thousand are publishing the good news who have not been baptized in symbol of a dedication! The coming convention furnishes a fine occasion for all dedicated to take this step. (See “Watchtower,” 6/1/58, p. 329, Why Dedicate Ourselves to God?) 13 min: Arrange locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">complish your ministry” means toil, self-discipline—work I “Keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” Always have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” Work to make June a fruitful month to Jehovah’s praise.—2 Tim. 4:5; Phil. 2:12, 13; 1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The assembling of ourselves together is a God-given requirement. Gonsequently, Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide will be doing just that in a few short weeks. Will you be there too as a publisher of good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Have you made your personal plans for attending the assembly? Have you sent in your request for rooming accommodations? Have you included good-will persons in your plans? Also, have you sent in your Volunteer Service Application so some of your time can be utilized to assist visiting brothers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> New York publishers are working diligently to obtain an adequate supply of rooming accommodations. They are happy to do this, accepting it as their assignment of hosts for this great assembly. There is still time to obtain rooming accommodations, so we suggest that you write immediately. The rates in private homes are reasonable. Most of the room assignments will be mailed to you directly. However, those few who may not receive them before they leave home may obtain them at the rooming department in New York. You should keep the address of your rooming accommodation in a notebook or on a slip of paper in your wallet. Carry this throughout the entire convention. Do not trust your memory or depend solely upon others. If you have the address written down and with you, then you can always find your room and your luggage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Inasmuch as the July offer is two bound books on a dollar contribution, why not be prepared to share in the witness work en route to New York? Take literature with you, especially magazines and tracts. Be well equipped to tell others about the good news. You should keep an accurate record of the time you spend. Add it up and include it on your July report. And, of course, when you get back home, you will not want to forget to report the time spent in the field at the convention. Since many of you will be gone from home during the latter part of July, you should arrange to mail field service time to someone in the home congregation so the congregation report can be made out and submitted to the Society. Brothers from countries outside the United States should plan to airmail heir July reports back home. All ill want to be publishers in July as well as other months. To be sure you are, why not do some preaching before you leave for the assembly and turn in your report and then mail the others. July should be another good month for preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSEMBLY ANNOUNCEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">FIELD SERVICE: To facilitate field service while in New York the Society has arranged for a number of Kingdom Halls (15), which are strategically located, where territories will be available. One of these should be close to your rooming location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ELDERLY PEOPLE : Elderly people or others who require assistance going to and from Yankee Stadium or the Polo Grounds should make such arrangements with those they know from their local congregation rather than expect the convention to provide such assistance after they get to New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TRAILER CAMP : It appears very remote that a trailer camp can be located for this assembly. The Society has exhausted all possibilities within a radius of over fifty miles from New York. Consequently, we suggest you write for rooms that are being listed at reasonable rates. The next </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> will say yes or no.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PIONEER REGISTRATION: Meal tickets will be provided for pioneers who were on the list prior to January 1, 1958. These tickets may be obtained at the Convention Headquarters (77 Sands St., Brooklyn 1, N. Y.) up to and including July 24. From the 25th on, they will be available under the bleacher section at Yankee Stadium, near the Rooming Department. If you lose or forget your meal ticket, no others will be issued. Please do not ask for a replacement. This meal ticket will serve as identification, enabling you to obtain literature at pioneer rates. Vacation pioneers and those entering the pipneer service after January 1 will not get a meal ticket. They must bring their pioneer territory assignment card or appointment letter to obtain campaign literature at pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ORDER ASSEMBLY BADGES IMMEDIATELY. The Society is pleased to announce that a very attractive assembly badge card is being prepared. The badge cards announce the convention and will identify the delegate as well as invite others to hear the public lecture. These cards cost lc each. They may be worn by all conventioners from the time they leave home to travel to New York until the convention is over. This will help you enter many discussions with other persons along the way as you are traveling to New York city. The assembly badge card should be kept in a celluloid card holder to keep it clean and neat. These holders will cost 5 c each. Full remittance must be sent with order for cards and holders. Congregations should order immediately for all convention delegates that want this badge card or celluloid card holder. We would like to have your orders in by June 15 for both items. Delegates from overseas will be able to obtain badges at Yankee Stadium or the Polo Grounds if not supplied by your branch before you leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the attractive cards type or print the name of the person and the congregation represented. American delegates will show the city and state, others will give the city and province or country. It would be well for the congregation servant to supervise the typing or printing on the cards so it will be done neatly and legibly. If there is someone that is apt at printing, it may be well for him to take care of all the cards in the congregation. As in all other matters, we want to keep neatness in mind, as it will add materially to convention advertising. Wearing these cards in the badges will be an excellent way through which you can become acquainted with others as well as meeting delegates from various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CAR SIGNS AVAILABLE. The Society is again providing signs that may be used on the back of automobiles en route to New York. The sign will be approximately 4i&quot; by 20&quot; in size, attractively designed using fluorescent colors. It will provide good identification as well as advertising. The sign is very readily applied by merely removing a protective paper coating on the back and then sticking it on any clean surface, such as the bumper. It will not harm these surfaces. The adhesive is a latex material that will readily stick to irregular surfaces or areas. The sign may be applied to a board and then fastened to the bumper. These signs are available for 10c each, and should be considered as cash items. Congregation servants should ascertain quantity required and order by June 15 at the same time you order assembly cards and celluloid card holders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TAPE RECORDINGS: Many have inquired about tape recordings of the convention this summer. The Society will make tapes of certain sessions. The tapes provided will be of high quality and will contain a two-hour program, recorded at 3 % &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font8"> 4, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Feeding the Lambs Through the Congregation Book Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus’ command to Peter, “Feed my young lambs,” applies to all dedicated Christians since then. (John 21:15; Matt. 28:19, 20) To feed the young lambs to the point where they not only are mature sheep but also become shepherds themselves, we must not onlj’ conduct home Bible studies with them but also lead them to the congregational spiritual table provided by Jehovah’s organization. The first and most convenient step in this direction is the congregation book study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> That includes, of course, attending ourselves, coming prepared to do our part to make the study lively, friendly and upbuilding. Attending ourselves makes it easy to encourage those with whom we study to come along. How soon to extend the invitation will depend upon their appreciation and progress. Once they have started coining, encourage them to prepare in advance and help them to make comments if they seem timid. Especially here is a place where the strong ought not to please themselves but to bear the burdens of the weak. (Rom. 15:1) And do not neglect the children.

The cost of these recorded tapes will be in the neighborhood of $4.50 each, approximately a dollar less than retail price for good plastic tapes alone. This will ensure better-quality recordings for all. The convention program will list the sessions that will be recorded and the location of Tape Recording Counters where orders can be placed. When you arrive at the convention, select the tapes you want and place your order with remittance. Tapes may not be ordered by mail. If you will not be at the convention but desire tapes, arrange for someone else to obtain them for you. The tapes will be available one or two days after the program presentation and you should pick them up at a location designated on the program. If you have not picked up your tapes during the convention, do so on Monday, August 4, at the convention tents. Those not called for will be mailed to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">simplifying the questions and giving them special attention. The congregation book study is particularly suited to helping these as well as the new ones to take part in meetings, because the conductor is able to give them individual attention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Since congregation book study locations are also service centers, let all mature publishers show up at contact time, prepared, yes, eager, to help the new and weak ones. Use tact and show patience. Invite them to the service meetings and tell them of the interesting things learned there. Children are the primary obligation of the parents, both as regards study and their training for the ministry. There is need for personal self-examination, either as to the parents’ maturity or as to their relationship with their children, if they shy away from taking them along in the service. However, circumstances may make it advisable for children to work with others at times. Aid the children to be regular publishers.—Deut. 6:7; Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> If the study conductor properly looks after the needs of all, and mature publishers co-operate, progress will be made toward maturity, resulting in a strong segment of a strong New World society.</span></p></li></ul>

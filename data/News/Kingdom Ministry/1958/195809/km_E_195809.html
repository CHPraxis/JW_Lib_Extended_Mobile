<p><span class="font4">Fulfilling the Divine Will in 1959 Service Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Schedule Your Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> What joys fill our hearts as we begin the 1959 service year! Happy thoughts of the Divine Will International Assembly with its magnitude, its theocratic fellowship and abundant spiritual provisions continue to thrill us to overflowing. No keeping quiet for us! With a host of new releases to study and use in our ministry, there is no standing still for us either. Onward! is our watchword. “For the time that has passed by is sufficient for [us] to have worked out the will of the nations.” God’s kingdom rules! We have good and great things to talk about. We feel as did David, who exclaimed: “O let people laud Jehovah for his loving-kindness and for his wonderful works to the sons of men.” “From the rising of the sun until its setting Jehovah’s name is to be praised.” “Praise Jah, you people! I shall laud Jehovah with all my heart in the intimate group of upright ones and the assembly. ... A memorial he has made for his wonderful works.”—1 Pet. 4:3; Ps. 107:15; 113: 3; 111: 1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Inspired by Jehovah’s goodness and enlightened by his revelations, each of us should determine in his heart to perform the divine will better during the 1959 service year. We should want to improve our ministry and become efficient teachers of the Word. To help us meet our dedication vows, seven goals are suggested for the coming year. To meet these goals is to progress in doing the divine will, to advance in the ministry, which is a Christian’s obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> These goals, which will help us to perform the divine will, are (1) regularity in all features of field service. (2) calling back on all interested persons and placements with the objective of establishing home Bible studies, (3) acquainting the newly interested ones with the theocratic organization by bringing them </span><span class="font1">to Meet New Goals</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to the meetings, (4) teaching and training new ones to preach by aiding them with sermons and in the field, (5) helping new ones to be regular in the ministry, (6) pressing forward </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to personal</span><span class="font5"> maturity through private study and participation and aiding in the training program and (7) working for a productive, ministry by showing greater love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> To meet these seven goals will mean a close scheduling of our time and a sticking to our schedule at all costs. It will also require getting off to a good start from the very first day in September. Train yourself to become regular in every feature of service. Do not allow yourself to slip back into lazy habits. “Brace up your minds for activity, keep completely balanced.”—1 Pet. 1: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Set your heart </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to call</span><span class="font5"> back </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on all </span><span class="font5">placements after a few days. Have in mind the starting of a home Bible</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Imitate the Shilammite m Exclusive Devotion</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Not even the wealth and glory of King Solomon could weaken the love of the Shulammite for her shepherd lover. Hers was an exclusive devotion. Firmly she resisted the temptation of a life of materialistic lux</span></p><img src="km_E_195809_files/km_E_195809-2.png" alt="" style="width:119pt;height:65pt;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR SEPTEMBER Two books and two booklets on a contribution of $1. THEME FOR SEPTEMBER Imitating the Shulammite in Exclusive Devotion.—Cant. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ury. Holding true to her lover, she said to him: “Place me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; because love is as strong as death is, insistence on exclusive devotion is as unyielding as Sheol is. Its blazings are the blazings of a study with interested ones as soon as possible in order to teach them the divine will. Make it your goal to be conducting at least one home Bible study by November 15. Enthusiastically invite those with whom you study to come with you to the various congregation meetings, especially to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, and offer to bring them. Acquaint them with the theocratic organization. Say to them as Paul did to the Corinthians: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.”—1 Cor. 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> As you progress in your study of the Bible with new ones, cultivate a strong desire for service. Teach them a sermon. Invite them to join you in the witness work, where you can help them to learn how to speak at the doors and offer the literature. Is this not what Jesus did when he sent out his apostles? “These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these orders”; and the account relates </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, cat. ]') </span><span class="font5">fire, the flame of Jah.”—Cant. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> How can we imitate the Shulammite in exclusive devotion? By resisting the seductive advances made by the world with its materialism, by keeping unbreakable integrity in our love toward the Shepherd-King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Our main work in September is to bring the good news to persons in unassigned territory. This year’s unassigned-terrltory service comes to a close September 30, so congregations having this territory should make an all-out effort to finish working it. While the weather is still favorable make wise use of your time. The unassigned territory offer is subscriptions for both </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and six booklets, for $2.

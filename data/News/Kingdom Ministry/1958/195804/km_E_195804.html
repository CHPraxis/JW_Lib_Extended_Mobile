<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Make Memorial Month a Milestone in Theocratic Progress</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> This is the month we have eagerly awaited and planned for—a special month for acting on wise sayings, such as that found at I’roverbs 1: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Life-giving wisdom this I But how does this wisdom cry aloud in public places? By the true followers of Christ Jesus being filled with God’s wisdom, by their proclaiming this wisdom “publicly and from house to house.’’ In this way God’s wisdom cries out in our day, proclaiming publicly the good news of the Kingdom and the warning of the fate of this foolish world at Armageddon. Let wisdom cry out, then; let it be heard throughout April to resound gloriously in the greatest number of wisdom proclaimers and the widest witness ever achieved in a single month !</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> To help us do this we have special theocratic features; also, we have reached the climax of our annual </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtozver</span><span class="font13"> campaign. How well have you done? There is still time to do even better. Strive to reach the quota.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Weekend Activity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The weekend following Memorial offers fine opportunities to proclaim God’s wisdom. Saturday will be a special Magazine Day for all congregations and Sunday a special day for regular witnessing and offering the subscription. Sunday is the date for the special talk “A New Song for All Men of Good Will.” At the conclusion of this talk both the brothers and the public should be invited to take a supply of the April 15 special </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Use both the April 15 and April 22 special issues to make Memorial month a peak magazine month. What a milestone it will be if we attain not only the greatest number of Memorial attenders but also the greatest in magazine placements! We can, if all publishers place at least one magazine a day, pioneers six and special pioneers nine.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">My dear Singers of Good News:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As we walk in our integrity Jehovah showers upon us undeserved kindness. He wants us to help the other sheep and he blesses us in our doing It. For evidence of this, look at December’s world-wide report, 701,470 ministers preaching the good newsl What a host singing “a new song for all men of good will”! With this happy crowd working regularly each month Just tgink of the home Bible studies that will be conducted in April and the number of persons who will be attending the Memorial celebration on April 3 with us and the great crowd of new ones who will be saying, “Come.” April is certain to bring us more responsibilities in showing hospitality to strangers. (Heb. 13: 2) If we take advantage of this opportunity many of these will be privileged to come to the world assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in July, to climax our year. Now is the time for all of us to pray and work, “acting on wise sayings for our day,” so that Jehovah’s will may be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Walking with you in integrity,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Last year Memorial month culminated in the exultant news: “We Made ItI” Can we make it tills year —the 20-percent increase, or a peak of 225,314 publishers? Indeed we can, if all of us resolve to heed the apostolic counsel: “Thoroughly accomplish your ministry.”—2 Tim. 4: 5; Rom. 15 : 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Showing that Kingdom ministers are accomplishing their ministry and upbuilding their neighbors is the January report. Over 170,000 home Bible studies were conducted ! Here, then, is excellent potential for the 20-percent i ncrease! So let all publishers conducting studies invite and encourage new ones to begin acting-on wise sayings in April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">, <sub>t</sub> OFFER FOR APRIl “Watchtower” subscription for one year and three booklets on a contribution of $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR APRIl</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Acting on Wise Sayings for Our Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—Prov. 1:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup> If April is to culminate in a milestone of theocratic progress, publishers and servants must do their part, as outlined in the March </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> demonstration “Reaching Our Goal in April.” Assist all associated with the congregation to take a part in letting wisdom cry out publicly. Seek to make the congregation a 100-percent preaching congregation during April. All who have not reported by April 6 will be given special help. Assistant congregation servants will give lists to study conductors of all who have not reported by April 6 and for each succeeding weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> To aid new publishers further, service centers in April will feature a special program each Sunday</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">morning after the daily text. For the first Sunday: introductions appropriate to the territory will be discussed and demonstrated. The second Sunday: talking points from the special issue will be considered for use with subscription offer. The third Sunday: how magazines can be placed on conclusion of subscription offer if subscription is not taken. The fourth Sunday : local objections and how they may be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> So onward into the month’s blessed service: Memorial, the special Saturday Magazine Day, the special Sunday talk, work with the special magazines as we climax the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> campaign and special efforts to reach a 20-percent increase in wisdom proclaimers. Congregations reaching the goal should write on their report cards, “We Made It I” May we be able to say that, as a nation, the country resounded with life-giving wisdom to the praise and honor of its Source, Jehovah Most High.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Acting on Wise Sayings for Our Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk on “Acting on Wise Sayings for Our Day.” (See “Watchtower,” November 1, 1957, p. 657, and April 1, 1958, p. 208.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk, together with questions and answers, on the letter from the president and the main article “Proclaim God’s Wisdom in April!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">22 min: Demonstration on “Placing Our April Magazine Quota.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) April biggest magazine month yet. Presses have worked overtime printing them for us. Our responsibility now to place them with persons of good will. Each has quota: Publisher 30, pioneer 180, special pioneer 270. If 20-percent quota of publishers reached in United States and all place full quota of magazines it would mean about 8,000,000 magazines placed in one month—a stack thirty times higher than the Empire State building. Also mention combined total for local congregation and pioneers. How will we place them all?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">DEMONSTRATION (18 min.) (Set scene with table on platform containing one stack of 30 and another of 180 magazines; a third stack of 270 if special pioneers in congregation.) Magazine-territory servant explains stacks represent minimum quotas of publishers and pioneers for month or one-a-day and six-a-day average. Each to reach quota if schedule is followed and every opportunity seized to place them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Publisher is called to platform to explain how he will do it. Servant interviews publisher as to schedule he will follow. Replies he plans to support prestudy work, Magazine Day—morning or afternoon, back-call night and regular Sunday house-to-house work. How will this help him place quota? To answer in each case, publisher takes number of magazines from publisher stack and demonstrates how fast they will go. If he placed only tw’o before study, two on back-call night, four on Magazine Day and two more on Sunday he will have exceeded weekly quota. Generally he places many more when he shares fully in these features. Thus in four weeks all will be gone. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another publisher, not able to make all contacts, is asked how she will place quota. Taking magazines from stack of thirty she demonstrates how she will be able to do street work; will talk to people who come to house during week; will take some with her when shopping and offer them to businessmen she deals with and she also will share as often as she is able in regular service. In four weeks all will be gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Schoolboy then asked how he will meet quota. Taking magazines from stack of thirty, he demonstrates how he plans to at least place quota just doing house-to-house work after school. Servant asks if that is only service he will do. Replies “No,” that he will engage in other features of service also, and place many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Audience now asked if they know of any other ways to place quota. Some mention special midweek contacts for housewives and those working nights; others say they will talk to neighbors, friends or associates at work; others especially stress offering magazines when people too busy to hear sermon or can’t take subscription, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Large pioneer stack still remains so pioneer asked to demonstrate how they can be placed. Quickly stack diminishes and more are called for as pioneer shows that more time in service and seizing every opportunity makes six magazines a day go fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Quota is low in view of available time and ways to engage in magazine activity. Table now bare as magazine counter will be at end of month. Local and national quota will be exceeded if all share fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Col. 1: 25] at the bottom of page 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: News report based on “New World News” and “Memorial Day Witnessing.” Include local news such as names of sick, experiences and service arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Study conductor’s report. One or two conductors will give a report of the meeting with the congregation servant. Emphasize how conductors will aid all publishers in their group to be out in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration on “Special Magazine Presentations.” To be conducted by the school servant-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on “Older Books Now Available.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Talk </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font12">“Meeting Our April Magazine Quota.” To help us to do that let us note the magazine activity of some of our brothers in other lands, as reported in our 1958 “Yearbook.” If any think the quotas for April are high let them note the Okinawa report. (193) And in Iceland a sister, a widow with four children, placed 119 and 143 of the special issues for which there were two campaigns in that island. (79) Of special value in placing magazines is friendliness, as a district servant in the West Indies found. (274) In Martinique brothers And public bars good places for leaving magazines, as many as 30 in an hour! (172) Magazine routes also can greatly help, as one African publisher in Basutoland finds. (252) Can a publisher place 40 magazines in 30 minutes? Yes; see report on Ceylon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(114) And don’t overlook incidental </span><span class="font12">witnessing. One Cuban circuit servant placed 18 on one train trip. (139)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">24 min: </span><span class="font12">Demonstration on “Know Your Magazine.” Audience should have with them April 15 and 22 issues of “The Watchtower” and “Awake!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (2 min.) Point out need of being familiar with contents of magazines in order to use them effectively to awaken people out of sleep. (Rom. 13: 11) To awaken others we must first be awake to what is in magazines and to the points of interest in them. How well do you know the magazines you use?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (10 min.) Chairman selects some questions from “Check Your Memory” and “Do You Know?” and quizzes audience. Two or three of the publishers who answer are called to platform and interviewed on how they plan to present magazines. They should be notified in advance so they will be prepared. The things of interest they point out in the .articles should be usable in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (5 min.) One of the publishers demonstrates how he will direct householder’s attention to an article in “The W'atchtower” at completion of his sermon. Another demonstrates how points of interest can be used in a short sermon on Magazine Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE III (4 min.) A publisher demonstrates how “Awake!” can be presented effectively by knowing what is in the magazine. In a short presentation that can be used on Magazine Day he demonstrates how to use the articles in “Awake!” and how to offer it and “The Watchtower” for a ten-cent contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Summarize practical suggestions for presenting the subscription offer as well as when offering single copies. Encourage all to share in magazine activity for April by supporting service arrangements. If suggestions are used, should have little difficulty placing quota of magazines. Improve your magazine distribution by knowing your magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">11 min: Experiences on placing magazines—new publisher experiences, how individuals are doing in reaching the quota, etc. Conclude with talk encouraging all to push toward the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [Col. 4: 17] at the bottom of page 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font12">Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Talk on “Plan Now to Vacation Pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Reading of the convention letter with comments and talk on “1958 International Convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Talk on “Can You Serve Where the Need Is Great?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Arrange locally. (Include counsel for rounding out April’s special activity and making the last weekend a big one in magazine placements, subscriptions and new publishers.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION ORGANIZATION</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Servant Meets with Congregation Book Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Conductors</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Not unlike the nation of Israel, .Jehovah’s New World society today is organized theocratically. From the largest groups down to groups of ten or more, there are chiefs or servants to minister to the needs of the people. (Dent. 1:15) The congregation book study conductor usually has a small group to look after, but this does not minimize the importance of his job. No mere conductor, he is a teacher in Bible study and in the field ministry. He must lovingly minister to the needs of those in his group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> After the congregation servant and all book study conductors have reviewed the duties of the book study conductor, they will meet and discuss ways to improve the book studies and service center arrangements. This can be sometime during the early part of April. The congregation servant and the conductors should have uppermost in mind the improvement of their work by learning how to apply the instructions and suggestions of the Society in the respective studies and service centers so as to bring about steady improvement. As the name implies the places where book studies are held must be real centers for Kingdom service. Do not call them “areas.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Book Study: (1) Preparation by conductor and those attending essential for good study. (2) How to have more attend and participate. (3) How to make study more inter</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Older Books Now Available</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Society has taken an inventory all over the United States to ascertain the location of large supplies of older books being held by congregations that are available for distribution. It is felt many congregations and individual publishers would like to have some of these older publications for their libraries, and that some congregations may wish to have a few on their shelves for future use. The following are available:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font11">Preservation</span></a></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Service Center: (1) Conductor<sup>-</sup>must take lead and set proper example. (2) Use of two lists each month in aiding irregular publishers, assigning self and other mature publishers to help. (3) Keeping training program progressive. (4) Building up back-call and Bible study work. (5) Building up magazine work within service center. (6) Making service contacts more interesting and upbuilding. (7) Effective coverage of territory by group witnessing (magazines and regular offer).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> General: (1) Should be interested in progress of all in group. (2) Call on brothers at their homes periodically to build them up with spiritual discussion. (3) Directing interest to organization, having in mind that service center is steppingstone for attending other congregation meetings; group not to be isolated from congregation. (4) Any local problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The congregation servant will be visiting the service centers regularly to give attention to strengthening the groups. He should check the above points again as well as others needing attention in making his visits. At that time he will also work several times personally with each of the conductors in the field service. He should show the study conductor the importance of keeping in touch every month with all persons and publishers associated with his service center.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Day Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This day that has been set aside by the world for decorating graves is a splendid time to “comfort all that mourn” by going to cemeteries and quietly and tactfully witnessing to individuals there. Avoid crowds and ceremonies. Some publishers have done this with good success. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> issues of May 22 and June 1 will be designed for this type of witnessing. Orders for extra copies of these issues should be in the office no later than April 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Serve Where the Need Is Great?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Can you? Many have responded to the call and are enjoying great blessings. Among these are many colored brothers who have left large cities in the North and West to serve in the South, now so greatly in need of help. A number of congregation servants also have responded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> However, here in the United States we still have forty-five congregations with sisters as congregation servants. In all, there are 200 congregations badly in need of servant leadership. Additionally, there are 118 counties having from 10,000 to 30,000 inhabitants that are wholly unassigned. Among states having such counties are Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Most of the congregations needing servant aid to continue are in towns of but a few thousand in population, and the same is true regarding the towns in unassigned counties. Brothers who can serve where the need is great should keep this in mind. There is also still great need for families to move into towns and cities in sections of the Northeast, Midwest and South.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> So, if you cannot go to a foreign land, how about serving here in the United States where the need is great? And if you cannot go at once perhaps you can arrange to go to such territory on the way to the great convention this summer, get located and then return to work there after the convention. Write to 117 Adams Street stating in what particular section of the country you would like to work!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Unassigned Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">July, August and September are the months to work unassigned territory again this year. Under separate cover we are sending each congregation a letter explaining what territory formerly open is no longer available for assignment. When selecting territory from the unassigned territory booklet sent to each congregation in 1956, please check this letter to see if the territory is still open. With the letter each congregation will receive an Application for Unassigned Territory. Pioneers may write for an application. All congregations desiring the privilege of sharing in this work should submit their application to the Society before May 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Magazine Presentations</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> To bring praise to Jehovah during April we want to share in placing the special magazines. Upon reading them you will agree they contain a timely message. While men of this world face a disturbing present and a frightening future, we have a song that can truly cheer up those who will listen to God’s song of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup>A new publisher might say: “These two special issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> are being given world-wide distribution. They contain a heart-cheering message that you will find most encouraging. You may have both of them on a small contribution of ten cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> On Magazine Day a publisher might say: “Good morning. It has been my pleasure to talk to many of your neighbors about the special issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> I believe you will agree that we very much need a happy outlook today. Reading this article I learned that God has provided a new song to cheer up men of good will. You may wonder just what this song is and how it is being sung. Rather than being a man-written, sentimental song, this song is the heart-warming good news of God’s kingdom. Hence this song has a life-giving theme, highlighting God’s provision of everlasting life in a new world. I’m sure you will want to learn about it; and this copy of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> along with</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In calling from store to store or from house to house you might say: “Much has been said about the threat of war and the prospects for disarmament. Almost everyone agrees that the need for disarmament has never been greater. But what are the genuine prospects for such? Is disarmament the real means for security? This article in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> will prove most enlightening.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> In the prestudy work you might say: “Good evening. I stopped by briefly as one of. your neighbors to give you a message of lasting value.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Youth ■ Don’t waste your life away I True, you are young only once, but that is all the more reason why you should make the most of your youthful years so that you may be found worthy to live in Jehovah’s new world of perpetual youth. Because if you misuse your early life now by pursuing selfish interests, you will not only regret it later, “but know that on account of all these The [true] God wall bring you into judgment. So remove vexation from your heart and ward off calamity from your flesh, for youth and the prime of life are vanity.”—Eccl. 11: 9, 10. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> November 15, 1957, pages 699-702)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">al ? The wise man answers: “Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come.” So the only sensible, profitable thing for youth today to do is God’s will. If youths be wise they will apply their lives in the full-time service of Jehovah. They will plan to vacation pioneer, and thus lay for themselves a good foundation for the future.—Eccl. 12:1 ; 1 John 2: 17.</span></p>

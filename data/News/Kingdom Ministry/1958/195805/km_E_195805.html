<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. 1 NO. 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.”—Psalm 26: 11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As magnetic forces permeate the area around a magnet, so does God’s spirit radiate from him and permeate his organization. That Invisible force activates his earthly servants to be joyful proclaimers of his good news. But they cannot expect to keep filled with it unless they stay close to the organization, where its field of influence is. To remain there it is essentia! to keep active in the ministry. We must speak the truths the spirit has given us and permit it to work through us. “Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, as we combine spiritual matters with spiritual words.”—1 Cor. 2:12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What is the most effective way for our spiritual words to bring comfort and hope? It is by making back-calls and by conducting Bible studies. Not only does this bring goodwill persons a knowledge of the truth but it brings them under the influence of God’s spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We need to pray for them to get a mental grasp of the whole scope of Jehovah’s purposes, just as Paul did for the Ephesians. “On account of this I bend my knees to the Father, in order that you may be thoroughly able to grasp mentally with all the holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge.”—Epi). 3:14, 18, 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When our prayers are accompanied by zealous ministerial activity on our part God’s spirit can operate through us to answer them. Make a special effort to let it operate through you during May and June. Let these two months be outstanding In your personal back-call and Bible study activity. If all publishers follow the spirit’s leading by engaging wholeheartedly in these two features of service we will have new peaks in back-calls and Bible studies. It can be done by calling on new subscribers and magazine placements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Besides back-calls and Bible studies May has something special for us. It is the opportunity to “comfort all that mourn” by visiting the cemeteries on this country’s Memorial Day. By means of timely issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> we will be able to comfort and give hope to those who have lost loved ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Home Bible Studies by Assuming Responsibility!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As noted elsewhere in this Issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> it Is the home Bible studies that get results. Weekly study of the Bible with the aid of basic publications matures persons of good will, making them want to dedicate themselves to do God’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> During May and June we are aiming for a peak In home Bible studies. To attain that we must, of course, also build up our back-calls, for unless we make back-calls there will be no Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER FOR MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Two books and two booklets on i, ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a contribution of $1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEME FOR MAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">’ Keeping Filled with the Spirit of God., &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Eph. 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> True, we are making progress. From September, 1957, to March, 1958, we have increased in studies from 140,618 to 177,584. Congregation publishers have improved during that time from an average of .6 to .7; pioneers from 4.9 to 5.8; and special pioneers from 7.6 to 8.1. While the Society has never set a Approach them tactfully, and speak to them with kindness. Each congregation can then send a report to the Society giving the number who engaged in this work, the number of magazines placed and any interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By enthusiastic activity during May and June show that you are filled with the spirit and permitting it to operate through you. Use all that the spirit provides for Jehovah’s service. Use the new sermon, use the timely magazines, make back-calls, conduct Bible studies. Be aglow with zeal for Jehovah’s kingdom and for his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">quota of studies for pioneers it would be well for each pioneer to try to have at least five different studies a week and each special pioneer no less than eight, even as each congregation publisher should have at least one home Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> While the circuit servant has set apart his afternoons for back-calls and studies, many congregations are not fully taking advantage of this provision to improve and increase in these. This is a mistake and shows a lack of appreciation! Congregation servants should arrange for a full schedule so that a maximum number of publishers can work with the circuit servant and receive- needed back-call and home Bible study training.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The home Bible study work is not only the most fruitful but also the most joyful part of our Kingdom ministry. There is a warm and friendly relationship between the minister and the good-will student. True the conducting of home Bible studies means responsibility, but there is so much joy and satisfaction in connection with It that the burden seems light indeed!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Theme: Keeping Filled with the Spirit of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Talk on “Keeping Filled with the Spirit of God.” (See “Watchtower,” July 15, 1957, p. 436, and May 1, 1958, p. 267.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font12">Questlon-and-answer coverage of main article “Keep Filled with the Spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font12">Develop and demonstrate a model sermon. A competent brother should be used as chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (3 min.) Much wisdom and knowledge fills the earth, but little of it is life-giving. Only right knowledge can lead to life. New sermon, which all Kingdom publishers should prepare to use, will emphasize the need of and the reward for gaining right knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">DEMONSTRATION (12 min.) Model study group has gathered at service center Sunday morning to review sermon before service. They discuss introduction, scriptures to be used and conclusion for a smooth transition into literature offer. They demonstrate to one another how they will give parts of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">sermon.</span><span class="font12"> A suggested introduction might be: “Good morning. My name is---. I’m a minister. You may</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">think it strange that a minister you do not know would call at your door, but I have a matter of the greatest importance I wanted to discuss with you. Today much emphasis is being placed on technical and scientific knowledge and the gaining of material possessions. You may have noticed, too, how such materialistic thinking has pushed spiritual interests into the background. To emphasize the need to seek the right knowledge, Jesus set forth a principle that would be good for all persons to consider. He said here at Matthew 6: 33 . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Theme: Knowledge That Leads to Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Seek first the Kingdom —Matt, 6: 33 Materialistic knowledge and gain do not lead to life—illustrated by parable (paraphrase) —Luke 12: 16-21</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Knowledge, is a superior defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Eccl. 7: 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Everlasting life comes from knowing Jehovah and Christ Jesus —John 17: 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (5 min.) Audience asked for other suggestions for introducing and making-transition from sermon to oiler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (5 min.) Calls on mature publisher from study group to give sermon before audience. Then chairman concludes with brief remarks on value and need of all using sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Arrange locally, including closing announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Talk and demonstration to explain and illustrate how to fill out room request forms and volunteer service forms correctly. Stress the need for accuracy, thoroughness and promptness in filling out the forms. Include convention information article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">22 min: </span><span class="font12">Demonstration on “Prompt Revisits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (4 min.) Talk on urgency of calling back within week while interest still alive. Our responsibility to help good-will persons see need of study. We should make definite appointments and then keep the appointments. “Do not loiter at your business.”—Rom. 12: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE I (8 min.) Literature has just been placed by publisher and she is heard making definite appointment to call again. After she leaves she jots down all information on house-to-house record. Inside home, person of good will is seen reading with evident interest the “Good News” booklet. Through pantomime audience is shown why good-will person is unable to keep up interest. As she reads, postman delivers interesting letter, children come home from school, gossipy neighbor comes in with latest neighborhood happenings, etc. Booklet is forgotten, becomes hidden under other papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">SCENE II (4 min.) Sister “Positive” calls back at time appointed with back-call sermon prepared. Greets person of good will with friendly smile and enthusiastic expression, saying: “Good evening, Mrs. ---. Since I called on</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sunday morning I took some time to look up some further information on the subject of right knowledge that we discussed. I would like very much to share this information with you.” Publisher is invited in, but householder apologizes for books and booklets not having been read, although booklet was looked at—“they are around somewhere.” Publisher, prepared for such occasion, brings out two “Good News” booklets and mentions that many things interfere with our desire to learn. This is why we call back quickly so life-giving information may be kept alive and expanded. Then she goes into back-call sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CHAIRMAN (6 min.) Discusses with audience points learned from demonstration and calls for experiences from those who have already put into practice the Society’s suggestions on calling back within week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 mln: Talk on “Increase Home Bible Studies by Assuming Responsibility!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Arrange locally, including closing announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">12 min: Cover “Make Sure of All Things”, on Marriage from page 255 “Christian Duties of the Husband” to the end of page 257. To be handled by audience participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Presenting the Good News” —talk and demonstration. To be conducted by the school servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">13 min: Talk on “Continue to Help New Ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [2 Tim. 4:5] at the bottom of page 1 and closing announcements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">5 min: Welcome, text, comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: New World News Report. Include interesting points from the “Yearbook” on countries reported on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Talk, together with questions and answers, on “Congregation Organization” article “Aiding the Other Sheep Through ‘The Watchtower.’ ” 20 min: Talk and demonstration on use of May 22 and June 1 magazines. Show how these magazines, discussing death and the resurrection, can tactfully be used at cemeteries and in the house-to-house service during worldly “memorial” season. See “Memorial Day Witnessing” in April “Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On date of release of the May 22 and June 1 issues, begin featuring the two articles whenever you present magazines. Strive to get considerable experience in offering them before the worldly “memorial” day. Remember to keep presentations brief and to the point. Take with you to the cemetery a supply of the tract “Hope for the Dead.” When people are not receptive to the magazine offer, give them a tract. Those having unusual success may wish to report their experience to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Arrange locally. (Include comments on the text [1 Pet. 1: 13] at the bottom of page 4 and closing announcements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH MEETING IN MAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those congregations having a fifth meeting should arrange their own program. A suggested talk: “Being Conscious of Your Spiritual Need.” Include points from the article in “Awake!” of April 8, 1958, and counsel on meeting attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The following is also suggested:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">8 min: Talk on “Bible Studies Get Results.” Tn the New World society we do not encourage people to make a decision for Christ on the emotional impulse of the moment. We first lay a groundwork so that dedication is intelligently and sincerely made on the basis of faith and love. For this nothing can compare with home Bible studies, as our 1958 “Yearbook” shows. Thus in every </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">one of the following instances </span><span class="font12">the result was one or more publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How vital studies are can be seen from a certain woman in the United States reading “The Watchtower” for years, but taking her stand after just a few studies, even as did a woman Methodist minister. (71) If unable to have the study at home we may be able to hold it at the place of business, with unexpected results, as seen in the report from Argentina. (83) Merely sitting in on a few studies caused a person of good will in New Guinea to start preaching, with remarkable results. (89) Sometimes unknown to us others may be listening and who then take their stand, as it happened in Finland. (156) If children attend we can rouse their interest by giving them “homework” to do, as did one publisher in British Guiana. (102) And for results from studies with booklets see the reports on the British Isles (106) and Greece. (170)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: What Do You Remember from “Kingdom Ministry”? Audience to answer questions based on articles in “Kingdom Ministry.” Chairman will select pertinent points from following issues: September, the main article outlining 1958 goals; October, Are You a Regular Publisher?; November, Parents, Do You Love Your Children?; January, New Magazine Quotas; February, Better Meeting Attendance; April, Can You Serve Where the Need Is Great? Also points from “Presenting the Good News” may be selected.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Aiding the Other Sheep Through the “Watchtower” Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> To Jehovah’s people the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study is the most important meetingof the week. Rightly, itshould have one hundred percent support. Not only does it provide spiritual food for the little flock, but the other sheep are also invited to share in this feast. What can we do to aid the other sheep to share more abundantly in these progressive revelations of truth from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">that, illuminate the path of the righteous ones?—Prov. 4:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We must first of all build up proper respect for the unique position </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> has in Jehovah’s arrangement. It is Jehovah’s provision for supplying food at the proper time. When studying with prospective sheep from the very beginning </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study should be held before them as the most desirable of all studies. Mention it often and aid them to see the value of attending so that they can get the benefit of association and of all the mature comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Them with You</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Also, do not just tell them about the meeting; accompany them. It is noted that even some of the older publishers do not come to the public meeting and remain for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study. In fact, the attendance is only seventy-two percent of the total publishers associated; and since many persons of good will are</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Letterhead</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A number of congregations have been printing letterheads, and they may do so if they think it necessary. Some congregations have printed letterheads with just the words “New-World Society.” This is meaningless, as it does not connect the Society with Jehovah’s witnesses. It could be any kind of a society. It is suggested that, if congregations are going to print letterheads for their use, a more explicit form be followed. For example, it could read: “New York, N.Y., Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Brooklyn Heights Unit.” Then on the right-hand side of the letterhead it could have “Kingdom Hall, 136 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.” On the lefthand side the meeting times could be shown, the hour and the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Letterheads printed in this manner advertise the name of the congregation and Jehovah’s witnesses, as well as directing people to the Kingdom Hall. This has meaning and identification.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13">included, it is obvious that greater appreciation for this study needs to be built up. Vital is the role it plays in gaining greater maturity for all who attend. Therefore, attend regularly. Participate and do your part to create a warm and friendly atmosphere at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font13"> study so that persons of good will desire to return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The study conductor can do much to help new publishers and those newly associated to attend. He can note who among his group are missing at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study and then display loving interest by encouraging them, yes, visiting them personally, aiding them to attend the study. Additionally, at the end of the congregation book study he can, from time to time, pose several questions to be answered at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study. This will serve to whet their spiritual appetites.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them Comment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Each one, including the newer publishers, should see the value of commenting. Help the newer ones to prepare their answers if necessary. Perhaps they may want to tell the conductor beforehand which paragraph they wish to comment on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> contains vital food for the other sheep. It is the responsibility of those who are more mature to direct good-will persons to this unlimited source of spiritual truths. Aid them to attend the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> study with you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">American Standard Version Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some congregations have written to the Society regarding the article in the March </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> on the American Standard Version Bible relative to the statement “new thinner edition.” Formerly this Bible was printed on heavier paper, making its bulk 1 is inches. This new thinner edition is printed on thinner paper and thus is 1&amp; inches thick.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> New publishers that have been helped in April to go out in the service should not be forgotten nor neglected during May. Even though they have been aided in the field once or twice, they are still very new and need much training and encouragement before they become sturdy, regular, mature ministers of God. Our desire should be to build these new ones up until they “all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God.” We do not want them to remain babes, being tossed about by doubts and tricked by crafty men. See, then, that they grow up strong in faith, rich in love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> For over three years Jesus taught and trained his apostles and disciples how to carry on the ministry. It had its effect, because after Pentecost people recognized by the apostles’ outspokenness “that they used to be with Jesus.” We should desire that our training be as thorough. Our heart should be set on developing ministers of quality, publishers that are efficient in every feature of the ministry. This takes time—sometimes many months—depending on the ability, appreciation and zeal of the new one. If we conscientiously assume our responsibility as teachers and preachers, the new publishers generally come along and do their part. So let us help them grow to Christian maturity through love.—Acts 4:13; Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What Is the best way to aid the new publisher to maturity? By gradually increasing his theocratic privileges and responsibilities. If he started to serve in the magazine work, keep up with that feature of service with him but Increase his privileges by asking him to accompany you in the house-to-house work, then the back-call and the Bible study work. Teach him to give the three- to eight-minute sermon. Train him how to overcome objections and refute falsehoods. See that he continues to study the publications by studying with him.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Preparing for the international assembly, no doubt, will keep you busy. But do not let this cramp your service to Jehovah. Just hustle a little more. Stay close to your studies and help them in the field. Let your advancement be manifest to all persons. “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4: 15,16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential Qualities of Sermons Part 8: Friendly, Conversational and Direct</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people have the most interesting subject in the world—the good news of the Kingdom. However, even though our sermon may have a good theme with excellent material, how does it appeal to the listener? Not only is an intellectual appeal necessary but we need to stir our listener emotionally. Otherwise he will not be moved to action. To achieve this the minister needs to be friendly, conversational and direct.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> First of all, we need to examine our attitude. Does each home contain potential sheep until you find out otherwise? Then do you get off to a good start with the householder? Avoid undue controversy by starting with a point of common interest. This will gain a listening ear. Further, be friendly disposed toward the people, just as Jesus was. A long face or an unhappy expression has no place with our message. Good news makes one radiate with gladness, thus showing the effect the truth has upon us. Remember- friendliness often begets friendliness and has much persuasive power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> To make your sermons appealing never lecture to the people. Converse with them and you will get better results. Conversation, like teaching, is an art. Therefore it must be cultivated. It is sometimes defined as a friendly interchange of views. Hence, do not do all the talking; it is only natural that the householder will want to say something. By being a good listener you may learn just what is needed to put your sermon across. Also, remember to include your companion in the conversation. He should pay attention to what is being said and not appear indifferent or preoccupied. This would detract from the sermon.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Beginning April 27 and until convention time the New York city publishers, along with their brothers from nearby New Jersey and Connecticut, will be diligently going from door to door obtaining rooming accommodations for all you conven-tioners. We feel sure many more rooms will be required this year than in 1953, and we have in mind that there are many more publishers locally to accomplish the task, too, for which we are glad.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Hotels in New York city are cooperating excellently by listing large blocks of rooms with the convention committee. Consequently we are confident that everyone will be adequately taken care of in the matter</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Always look directly at the person spoken fo, since this will enable your facial expression to convey the proper thoughts. Helpful to such directness is proper sermon preparation. It is difficult to convince someone else of the importance of what you are saying if you are not thoroughly convinced yourself. Failure to look right at the householder may indicate lack of sincerity, shyness or self-consciousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Gain respect for the message by not delivering it in an apologetic manner but rather in a direct, friendly and conversational style. Use these essential qualities to make your sermons even more effective.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IS THERE A LACK OF CONFIDENCE </span><span class="font6">IN THE MINISTRY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. Charles E. Newlin addressed the regular monthly meeting of Methodist preachers in Atlanta some time ago, and in the course of his address Mr. Newlin used the words: “I can prove by 99 per cent, of the business men of Atlanta that they lack confidence in the real, true manhood of the preachers of the city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Rev. B. Frank White, in leaving the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church, of Connellsville, Pa., is quoted as saying: “A man can’t be honest in the ministry and hold his job.” As Mr. White expects to remain in the ministry, although seeking another field, the inference is that he prefers a station where he can preach the Word in a style more in keeping with his conscientious scruples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The writer is inclined to believe that both of the assertions above quoted are rather broad, if not more or less exaggerated. We believe that the great majority of ministers are honest, and are doing all in their power to advance the cause of religion here on earth; we also believe that there are some in the pulpit who have no right to be there. The vision they saw in the clouds, “G. P. C.,” meant not to &quot;Go Preach Christ,” as they imagined, but to &quot;Go Pick Cotton,” —South .Georgia Progress. *</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Ministers Deserve Sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christian ministers deserve considerable sympathy. They are at the present time in a very trying position. It is the conscientious ones who are in .trouble. Behind them are the creeds and theories of the Dark Ages, to which they are chained:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(1) By the vows which they took at their ordination.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) By the honor of their position in the sight of their friends and neighbors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(3) By their financial necessities and those of their families.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Ministers possessed of an education know not only that the creeds of the past are in conflict with each other and with reason, but also that those creeds are in conflict with the Bible. Better translations and older MSS. have shown us tne fallacy of deductions made by our forefathers. Every educated minister now knows that the Hebrew word translated &quot;hell” in the Old Testament Scriptures, means the tomb—the state of death—the only hell that was known for four thousand years. They know that in our Common Version of the Bible this word Sheol is translated grave and pit more times than it is translated hell. They know that it never means and never did mean, anywhere, a place of fire and torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Baptist miniateis have gotten out a now Bible, in which they go to the trouble of translating this word Sheol by three English words, &quot;the under-world.” This hides the truth from the average mind about as much as the mistranslation hell does. But it helps our Baptist friends a little in dealing with Sheol, for of course, in the grave, in the tomb, is in &quot;the under-world.” Of course nobody thinks there is another world of living people in the center of the earth. It is only the dead that are in the under-world ■—in the tomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All educated ministers know further that the word Hades, in the New </span><span class="font5">Testa</span><span class="font6">ment translated heH, is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Sheol, and likewise means tho under-world, the tomb, the state of death or condition of death. The trouble with those ministers is that they know that their congregations are not generally aware of the truth on the subject, and they fear to tell those truths lest they should bo accused of having practiced deception in the past, when, as a matter of fact, they had simply taken from theologians of the Dark Ages what they in turn gave te the people, without examining tho ficripture proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Honesty to God and Religion Most Com</span><span class="font6">mendable</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another difficulty confronting these ministers is this: For the past twenty years the colleges of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, etc., have been teaching the Evolution Tlifeory—that man was not created in God’s image, that he was not in God’s sight &quot;very good,” and that he did not fall down from Divine favor. It teaches, on the contrary, that he was an evolution from the ape, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SPIRITS IN PRISON</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might &quot;bring its to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit, bp which </span><span class="font6">[tiro </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">experiences—death and resurrection] He preached unto the spirits in prison.” </span><span class="font6">—1 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Teter</span><span class="font6"> 3:18, 19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________________</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">*J*HIS text has been made the basis for <sup>4</sup> some peculiar presentations. From it some have deduced an intermediate state lasting between death and the resurrection. Others have claimed it as an authority for the doctrine of Purgatory. The difficulty in every case seems to be the failure to remember that the Bible always and everywhere teaches that the dead are really dead, that they know nothing, and that, therefore, it would be impossible to do any preaching to the dead htynans. Undoubtedly the theory that people are more alive after they die than when they were alive, is responsible for nearly all the foolish things which we have all at some time professed tc believe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before dismissing the thought that these “spirits in prison” are human spirits, let us note the fact that to say, “human spirits,” is an absurdity of itself, because human beings are not spirits, and spirit beings are not humans. “Who maketh His angels spirits” is the Scriptural proposition. True, we do sometimes speak of humans as possessing a spirit Of life, but by this we merely mean that they possess the power or energy of life, and the same Would, be equally true of the lower orders t&gt;f creation, beasts, fish, fowl, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, we sometimes speak of the Church as spirit beings—begotten of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Apostle speaks of the natural man in contrast with the New Creature, a spirit being. To appreciate this statement we must remember that the Church class receives the begetting of the Holy Spirit to the end that, if faithful, they may attain unto a spirit resurrection and become spirit beings, like unto the angels and like to the Redeemer. But we are fiot spirits yet, except by faith—by hope. However, the context shows that the Apostle had no reference to the Church, either; we were not in prison; we received the Message of salvation through the Apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Spirits Once Disobedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spirits to whom the message was given had proven themselves disobedient, says St. Peter. He even tells us the time of their disobedience, namely, that it was “in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing.” Surely, if noticing these particulars mentioned in the context, no one would be excusable for misunderstanding this Scripture and considering it in any way applicable to humanity of our day or to humanity in general. However, it is helpful to us to learn the full particulars of the matter. What was their disobedience, and when and how were they* imprisoned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Turning to Genesis 6:1-5, we find there-the cause of the disobedience of those-angels, who for a time had been permitted to see what they could do for the uplift of humanity, or, rather, permitted to demonstrate that the downward tendency of sin is incurable except in the manner which God has already arranged for through Messiah and His glorious-reign of a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead of those angels helping mankind out of sin they helped </span><span class="font5">themselves </span><span class="font6">into sin, and by so doing they </span><span class="font5">increased </span><span class="font6">the depravity amongst humanity, until the astounding record is that &quot;the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually.” The particular sin of those angels was-that when they were granted the privilege of materializing-^-of taking human, bodies for the sake of helping and instructing mankind—they misused this power and took to themselves the daughters of men for wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus these angels came gradually </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">prefer to live as men amongst men, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">to rear earthly families, rather than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">34 Craven Terrace, London, W.' abide in the condition in which they were created—spirit beings, higher than humans. Not only was this wrong in the sense that it was taking a course in opposition to the Divine arrangement, but it was wrong also because the thing was done for the cultivation and gratification of lust, and it led to their own moral defilement as well as having a baneful influence upon humanity; for we can readily see that for the angels, of superior powers and intelligence, to become leaders in lustful practices would mean a great influence upon mankind toward sin and defilement of mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are particularly told that the offspring of this improper union between the angels and the daughters of men were giants, both physically and mentally superior to the fallen human family—“men of renown.” And this statement, that they were “men of renown,” was at a time when manhood’s estate was reached at a hundred years, and implies that God did not interfere to hinder or stop the progress of sin for perhaps several centuries. In the meantime the race had become so corrupt that app.arently only Noah and his family were uncontaminated—all others had more or less come under the influence, directly or indirectly, of these fallen angels or their giant sons. Hence, of Noah it was written (not that he was a perfect man, but), &quot;Now Noah was perfect in his generation” (uncontaminated) and his family apparently the same. Hence these alone were saved in the ark, while all the remainder, more or less contaminated, were destroyed by the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“In Chains of Darkness.'<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was then and there that God imprisoned those spirits, angels, who kept not their first estate, and are, therefore, called fallen angels, devils, demons. They were not imprisoned in some far-off world called hell, nor are they engaged there in stoking fires for the torture of poor humanity. Following the leading of the Scriptures we find that when the flood came they were not destroyed, because, while their fleshly bodies which they assumed might indeed perish, yet tlmy would merely dematerialize, or assume their spirit conditions again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The record is that God cast them down, that He condemned them to an overthrow—that they might not any longer associate with the holy angels, but must be reserved in tartarus—our earth’s atmosphere. Here they were imprisoned, not in a special place, but in the sense of having their liberties restrained, &quot;in chains of darkness.” They were no longer permitted to materialize, and thus to associate with humanity. These things are distinctly told us by St. Jude and St. Peter (Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4, 5)—an explanation in full harmony with' the Genesis account of their fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Once Disobedient—Still Disobedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We, of course, cannot know that all of those fallen angels are still in a disloyal condition of heart. On the contrary, in harmony with our text, wo may suppose that some of these fallen angels have since repented of their wrong course, and it would be none too strong a way to -state the matter—that any such repentant ones would surely have terrible experiences as a result. To be obliged to be in close touch and relationship with the more evil and malignant ones, and to have knowledge of all their evil designs and efforts, would be a terrible experience, and, besides this, we may be -sure that the rebellious would not hesitate to persecute the repentant ones in every conceivable manner, as they would be lawless, regardless of the Divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand, the repentant ones would be obliged to restrain themselves and to not render evil for evil, knowing that this would be contrary to the Divine will. In other words, repentant ones amongst those fallen spirits, influenced by the preaching of Jesus, or otherwise, would have a kind of purgatorial experience, and the very thought calls forth our sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When imprisoned or cut off from the </span><span class="font6">privilege of materialization, many of the fallen spirits, we know not what proportion, continued their active opposition to God, after the manner of Satan. Hence they are spoken of as his angels, his messengers, his servants, and he is spoken of as Beelzebub, the Prince of Demons. Satan, who sinned much earlier than the others, and in a different way, the Scriptures tell us was an angel of a higher rank, or a higher nature, and this superiority of his has made him the Prince or ruler over the hosts of fallen spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Fighting Against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fight of Satan and his fallen angels is against God, against all who are in har-. ony with Him, against all the regulations of righteousness, and against all the channels and servants whom the Lord may use. St. Paul’s words along this line are forceful; he remarks that God’s people contend not merely “with flesh and blood,” but also “with wicked spirits in high positions,” and the question arises, “Who is sufficient for these things?” The reply is that none is sufficient; without the aid of the Redeemer His Church would be quite overcome and vanquished by evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Likewise, without the Redeemer’s aid through His Kingdom, without the binding of Satan, without our Lord’s releasing of the world from the bondage of sin and death, there would be no hope of the world’s recovery from its present bondage. But with the Apostle we exclaim, “If God be for us, who can ba against us?”—Romans 8:31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Through Mediums and Obsessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan’s original plan of attqck was to bring our race under his influence by misrepresentation—by putting darkness for light and light for darkness—for instance, the temptation under which Mother Eve fell. Satan there represented himself as Eve’s friend, giving her sound advice. He represented God as having a selfish motive behind His command that our first parents should not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan declared that God had told an untruth when He said that the penalty for sin would be death. Satan declared that man cannot die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And has he not since kept up the same line of falsification? And has he not deceived the whole world upon this very subject? Do not all peoples in every land believe that when a man dies he does not die, but gets more alive—exactly Satan’s lie of the first instance? How few have believed God, even amongst His people who truly love Him, and who truly desire to believe the teachings of His Word! We have all been under a kind of &quot;hoodoo.” &quot;The god of this world [Satan] hath blinded” our minds on this subject. We are now coming to see that death is the penalty for sin, and that the resurrection is the s.alvation which God has promised and will provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan has had powerful allies and servants in the fallen angels, and it is through their persistence that his lie has triumphed over the Divine Word of Truth— &quot;Dying, thou shalt die.” These fallen spirits have made various manifestations in every land for centuries, and thereby have apparently substantiated the theory that a dead man is more alive than when he was alive. Knowing that mankind would have nothing to do with them if their real personality were known, they hide their personality, and represent themselves as our dead friends who desire to speak with us, either directly or through mediums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A further desire of these angels is to obsess or to get possession of a human being. Being chained, or restrained from the privilege of materialization, the next most desirable thing, in their estimation, is to gain control over a human being, and to use- his body instead of their own. This is styled obsession, and persons so afflicted today are sent to an insane asylum, where, it is estimated, they constitute at least one-half of the entire number. In the days of our Lord these were not mistakenly supposed to be insane, but rightly declared to be obsessed. All remember the New Testament account that our Saviour and His Apostles cast out fallen spirits from humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Know Ye Not That the Saints Shall Judge Angels?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Following the Evolutionists came the Higher Critics, declaring that the Bible is really old wives’ fables and not at all inspired. Nearly all graduates of colleges and seminaries for the past twenty years have gone into pulpits, consecrated to the preaching of God’s Truth from the Bible standpoint, in violation of whatever conscience they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tiiese generally are the great and popular preachers of all denominations. They consider not the vows of their ordination, but practically’say, “We do not hide our unbelief to any great extent. We answer questions of the people with a measure of candor, dodging occasionally; and if they know anything about the Bible themselves, they know that we do not believe in its inspiration. If they wish to continue us as their preachers, and to honor us and to pay our salaries, we will continue to serve them. By and by we ■will get their faith in the Bible thoroughly undermined; and then we will come out into the open. Then we will tell them that we falsified a little for their good, as a mother would tell her babe a fairy story for its entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The preachers who are in trouble are the conscientious ones who believe the Bible to be true, and who have not yet gotten their bearings. They cannot long believe in an eternity of torture, yet are afraid to follow the course of the International Bible Students Association in a thorough Bible Study which ignores the creeds. These poor men know not what to believe, and are in great trepidation ■when a question is asked them by the people who pay them for religious advice. They carihot dig. , To beg they are ashamed. And to tell the whole truth about what they know and what they do not know respecting the Bible they are afraid. ...They Jjave. our. sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our advice to all such is, “Tell the truth and shame the devil!” Take your stand for what truth you see, and seek for more light upon God’s Word in this glorious dawning of the New Era, in which God declares that He is pleased to give an increase of light on things Divine. “The wise shall understand, but none of the wicked [or hypocrites] shall understand.”—Daniel 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would appear as if we are living </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the time of special testing so clearly foretold by the Lord. Everything hidden would be uncovered, He said. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness. (1 Corinthians 4:5.) If we would not be put to shame before Him, we must be honest. Who can doubt that honesty, especially in respect to God and religion, is most estimable from the Divine standpoint? None of us have anything whereof to boast. But if we are honest with our God we can look up io Him, by faith realizing that we are acceptable </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font6">Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">EXTRAORDINARY SERIES </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OF </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DISCOVERIES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The twelve years ending with the discovery of the South Pole are as full </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">dramatic achievement as the days of Drake and Raleigh, for not even in those times was there </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">more extraordinary series of discoveries and conquests.</span></p>

There was not a railroad across South America. A great part of Siberia was without rail or road except the old caravan trails. China was practically without railroads. Lhassa was unknown, forbidden to the white man. During a century and a half men had tried to reach the South Pole, and failed; and the North </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pole had baf-. </span><span class="font6">fled the efforts of 400 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">(Continued from page 1, column 4) our readers. See how many times Jesus and the Apostles cast out demons, and note the particulars. Although we still have with us spirit mediums, and many obsessed, we cannot know whether the proportionate number is greater or fewer than in our Lord’s day. Since the world’s population today is so much larger, the same number of evil spirits (which do not increase) would show proportionately less. But, however that may be, we may assume that some fruitage resulted from the great sermons preached to these in connection wjth the death and resurrection of our Lord, respecting which St. Peter tells us in our text. Additiojtally, St. Paul remarks, “Know ye not that the saints shall judge angels?” (1 Corinthians 6:3.) We do know that the holy arigels need no judging, no trial, hence the Apostle must in some way refer to a trial or judgment or testing of these spirits in prison who were once disobedient, in the days of Noah. And if the judgment or testing is a part of the Divine plan, it implies a hope for them, and in conjunction with St. Peter’s statement in our text it gives the reasonable inference that the preaching which Jesus did to them was not wholly in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How Jesus Preached In Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here arises another question: If Jesus was really dead, as the Scripture^ declare, if “He poured out His soul unto death,” and “made His soul an offering for sin,” and His soul was not raised from the dead until the third day after His crucifixion, how could He in the meantime preach to spirits in prison, or to anybody else? We reply that He could preach in the same way that the Apostle refers to, saying, “He, being dead, yet speaketh” (Hebrews 11:4); and again, in the same way that the blood of Abel is said to have cried to God—figuratively. Of one thing we are sure, namely, that Jesus gave no oral</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

Nevertheless, many of us for a long time had difficulty in our effort to harmonize this statement With the facts in the case. We said, “Where do we find the correspondence between Moses, the great lawgiver of Israel, and the Lord Jesus as his Antitype?” We read in the Law of Moses respecting the sacrifices and sin-offerings which he instituted, and in this could find foreshadowings of the ‘‘better sacrifices” of Christ; but wherein Christ fulfilled the Apostle’s statement </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">indeed been a difficult matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We said to ourselves, “In what sense can it be true that whosoever does not hear and heed Christ is ‘utterly destroyed from amongst the people’ ” ? The heathen have never heard in any sense of the word—are they utterly destroyed? The great majority of people in civilized lands have never heard in the sense here intimated, in the sense of heeding the commands of Christ; are they utterly destroyed? True, it would be far better that they should be utterly destroyed than that they should be eternally tormented, as many have imagined, but as the Scriptures do not teach. Nevertheless, would it not seem too bad that the great mass </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">humanity, even in our day, should </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font6">be condemned </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">utter destruction because they have not heard </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and not </span><span class="font6">heeded the voice of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hidden Mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle repeatedly tells us about the “mystery” hid from past Ages and Dispensations, but now due to be under-etood by the saints—not by the world. (Ephesians 3:3-9.) This mystery, or secret, not generally comprehended, the Apostle explains, is “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Colossians 1:27.) In other words, he would have us understand that God’s Plan for the salvation of the world is much greater, much larger, than any of us would have suspected—that it includes, first of all, the selection of the Church of this Gospel Age as members Of the Body of the great Christ, under Jesus their Head. (Ephesians 1:22, 23.) This whole company, the Head and the members, will therefore constitute The Christ of prophecy—“like unto Moses.” So, then, only those who recognize this “mystery,” this secret, are prepared to rightly understand our text and many other matters and statements of the {Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our text is not yet fulfilled, but awaits fulfilment until the entire Christ (Head and Body—Christ Jesus the Head and the Church which is His Body) shall have been “raised up.” Our Lord, the Redeemer and Head, has already been exalted, and His Church for nearly 1900 years has been in process of selection, formation and testing. In the Harvest of this Gospel Age the union between the Head and the members is promised, for our Lord declared, “I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">am there ye may be also.” (John 14:3.) He told us thus to expect to enter into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font6">address while Ho was dead. He preached in the way we sometimes refer to when we say, “Actions speak louder than words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the great object lesson which the fallen angels saw that constituted to them the great sermon that gave them a ground for hope. On several occasions the fallen spirits, when commanded to come out of human beings, declared that they knew Jesus. In the long ago they had known Him, when, as the Only Begotten of the Father, and His Representative, He had created them and all things that are made, and was also the <sup>1 </sup>Mouthpiece for all Divine ordei </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font6"> and regulations. They realized that He had come into the world to be its Redeemer; they perceived the great stoop that He had made from His lofty position on the heavenly plane to the servant position on the human plane. They admired His loyalty and faithfulness to God, but doubtless believed Him to be foolish; they never expected Him to rise from the dead. But when they perceived His resurrection on the third day, to glory, honor and immortality, “far above angels, principalities and powers and every name that is named,” pis sermon to them was complete, namely, that “the wages of sin is death,” but that &quot;the gift of God is eternal life.” (Romans 6:23.) And as they realized thus the power of God and the love of God for His human creatures, the Apostle’s words imply that this constituted to them a message of hope. Perhaps if they would show full contrition God eventually would have mercy upon them, even as He had had mercy and had provided for humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lesson is one for all. God’s power is Infinite, so is His love, His mercy, His goodness. Nevertheless, every wilful sin will have its punishment, a just recompense of reward, and only the willing and obedient shdll have the Divine favor and everlasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">life. Let each apply the </span><span class="font6">lesson to himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">glory and become heirs of God and jointheirs with Himself in His Kingdom, which He will establish at His Second Advent. From this ^standpoint, therefore, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">this entire </span><span class="font6">Gospel Age has been devoted to the raising up of this great Antitypical Prophet, foreshadowed or typified </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">Moses, and composed of many members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the completion of the work of this Age the work of the next Age will begin—a totally different work. The work of this Age is a selective one, or, as some dear Christian people term it, an elective work. God is gathering the “members of the Body of Christ” that He may use them in His great work of blessing and instructing mankind, and in thus raising up out of sin and death conditions all who will hearken to the instructions then to be given through the great Antitypical Moses—The Christ, in glory. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">the type, Moses led Israel and instructed them forty years before they were prepared to enter Canaan; in the antitype, the Greater than Moses—The Christ, Head and Body—will lead and instruct all the willing and obedient for a thousand years, at the close of which all the worthy ones will be ushered into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">antitypical Canaan of eternity, while </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font6">the contrary, all who fail to respond </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the teachings and assistances that will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">given to mankind by the Antitypical Moses will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be “utterly destroyed” in the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Law Covenant and New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s purpose toward the world—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">grant to Adam and all of his posterity a blessing of recovery from the “curse” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">sentence </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">death which came upon all through Adam’s disobedience—is clearly set forth in the Abrahamic Covenant, the Oath-bound Covenant, which declares, “In thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” Nevertheless, in thug providing a blessing for all; the Lord wisely put restrictions, requirements upon all who would have thht blessing to the fullest degree—to the perfect degree </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">eternal life. First, the Law Covenant was made with the nation of Israel that it might foreshadow the Plan, the arrangement of God for the world’s blessing, and at the same time might, by showing man’s deficiencies, point out the need for the better arrangements which God designed to bring forward in due time under the New Covenant, whose Mediator will be The Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Law given to Israel was just and true, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">Moses, the mediator </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">that covenant, was loyal and faithful both to the Lord and to Israel. Wherein then was the difficulty that the Law Covenant brought nothing to perfection? We reply that the difficulty lay in the fact that mankind </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">by nature fallen, and have the seeds of imperfection, sin and death in their constitution, and hence, with the very best of intentions, as the Apostle declares, “we cannot do the things that we would”—when we do good, evil is present with us. (Romans 7:21.) Thus the Jewish nation for centuries tried to keep the Law, and were unable to do so, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hence, as the* Apostle declares, “By the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s Word teaches us that the New Covenant is to be more successful than was the Law Covenant—it is to save all the willing and obedient of every nation, people, kindred and tongue. How Will it do this? Will the New Law connected with the New Covenant, and administered under the Kingdom of Christ, be less searching, less exacting than the Mosaic Law? And if the people of Israel could not rise to the requirements of Moses’ Law, because of their inherited weaknesses, will there be a modified law for the future? We answer, 'no! A perfect God could not give an imperfect Law—He could not set up a wrong standard of righteousness. What hope, then, can there be that the world’s opportunity under the New Covenant will result more favorably than did Israel’s opportunity under the Law Covenant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We answer that the difference will consist in the fact that the New Covenant has a more competent Mediator. In this we are not calling in question the willingness of Moses to haVe done for the people of Israel all that Christ will do for the world of mankind; but with all his willingness he was incompetent, because he, like the rest of the people, was a sinner —a member of the sinner race. Christ, on the contrary, will be a competent Mediator. Adam’s disobedience brought condemnation and death against the entire race; the obedience of Jesus even unto death, paid, settled, canceled that original condemnation, according to the Divine requirement, “a life for a life,” the Second Adam for the first Adam. And as ffie condemnation of Adam proceeded to all of his posterity, so the Redemption of Adam proceeds to all of his posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other words, our Lord Jesus bought the world of mankind with His own precious blood; His own untainted, uncondemned life He gave for the World’s Ran</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">som. </span><span class="font6">By reason of this Redemptive work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font6">Lord has the full, just right to restore, to lift up, out of sin and death conditions, through knowledge and disciplinary experiences, the whole world of mankind—so many as will obey. By thus lifting mankind up again out of sin and death, in recovering the willing and obedient from all that was lost through original sin, our Lord will prepare them for the tests of the perfect Divine Law which will come upon every one of them in the close of the Messianic Reign. But it will be a different matter for a perfect man to meet the requirements of the Divine Law than for an ftnperfect man to meet those requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, Father Adam, was a perfect man, yet failed; but his failure was due largely to an imperfect degree of knowledge. Those who will reach the close of the Millennial Age will have a clear knowledge of both good and evil. The world has gained its knowledge of evil during the 6,000 years of the prevalence of sin, and whoever will, shall, during the Messianic Reign, have full opportunity of coming to a clear knowledge of that which is good, and appreciate the difference between good and evil, and the rewards of these, so that the testing in the end of the Millehnial Age will fully justify the 7,000 years of instruction which God’s providence has arranged for Adam and his race. It is not for us to know what the proportionate number of those who shall ultimately attain eternal life and those who through disobedience to that great Prophet shall be “utterly destroyed from amongst the people” in the Second Death. We think it not unreasonable, however, to assume that fully a half of our race, or over, will gain life eternal Under the terms of the New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sealing the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some may inquire, Why the long delay .since Jesus died as the Redeemer of the world? Why did He not at once begin the work of the New Covenant, restoring the world of mankind? We answer that there are two principal reasons: First, the Lord evidently wished that the world should be filled, populated. This was the original commission given to Father Adam before he sinned: “Multiply and fill the earth.” Under the conditions of sin and death the race production has gone on rapidly, so that by now we may suppose that the whole number ever born into the world w'ould very nearly make a full population for it if it were turned as a whole into a Garden of Eden, or, as promised, into a Paradise of God. True, the Lord could raise up in the midst of the ocean other continents still larger than we now have, and possibly He may do so; but as it is, a reasonable estimate of the numbers born into the world for the past 6,000 years would make a tolerably well-populated earth. This would be one reason why the Lord would delay the establishment of the Kingdom, because with its establishment the birth-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">What did Jesus mean by His K. d words. “Verily I cay unto thee to- £ ■J] day, thou shalt be with Me in Para- F. d dise”—if Paradise, lost 6,000 years £ ago, will not' be restored until the F-J Second Coming of Jesus and the es- £ ■JJ tablishment of His Kingdom? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">rate will certainly decrease, and eventually entirely cease. For we are assured that those who' will attain perfection wHl &quot;neither marry nor be given in marriage,” but, like the angels of Heafen, will be without sex distinctions, as Adam was before Eve was created<sub>v</sub>$o be the mother of the race.—Matthew M;30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second, another HnpfiKant reason for the delay in the establishment of the New Covenant blessings is the necessity for the sealing of this New Covenant. It must be sealed before it can go into effect. The Apostle calls it a testament—that is, a will—saying, &quot;Where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the testator (the death of the one who makes the will), for a testament, a will, is of force only after men are dead; otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator is living.” (Hebrews 9:16, 17.) So this New Covenant, New Testament, could not go into effect except as the testator, Christ, died. But, you say, Christ died nearly nineteen centuries ago. Yes, we answer, Jesus died, and it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">His death that is efficacious for the cancellation of the sins of the world; but in the present time He is not applying the efficacy of His sacrifice to the world, but merely to those special &quot;believers” who flee from sin and by faith lay hold upon Him and come under His robe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">righteousness.

<p><span class="font6">luted the Memorial Supper in the night in which He was betrayed. He took the cup, saying, “This is My blood of the i.'ew Covenant (new testament—will), died for many for the remission of sins; partake, ye all of it.” Not the many who will be blessed by the New Covenant are invited to become partakers of the blood, blit the fbw, the “little flock,” who now by faith are called out of the world, elected as the Body of Christ—these are invitfe'd to participate with their Lord and Head in the blood by which the New Covenant is to be sealed. As our Lord said to His followers in the Narrow Way, “Drink ye all of it,” so the Apostle, putting the same matter in other words, says, “I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, feat ye present your bodies living sacrifices, holy, acceptable to God, your reasonable service.” —Romans 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again St. Paul says, speaking of the memorial cup representing the blood of Christ, “The Cup which we drink, is it not the communion of the blood of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Christ?”</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6">he calls attention to the fact that our pledge as followers of Christ, to lay down our lives in His service and for the brethren, as living sacrifices, is our communion or common participation with Jesus in His sacrifice. Not that the merit belongs to us, but under the cover of His merit we are accepted as His members, so that our sacrifices are counted in as part of His sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this standpoint of the “mystery” we can see that the entire Gospel Age of over eighteen centuries has been the time of &quot;the sufferings of Christ,” first the Head, and subsequently all the members of the Body of Christ, “filling up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ.” (Colossians 1:24.) We can see that the experiences of the Lord’s consecrated ones have been their communion, their fellowship, in the blood of Christ, in the sacrifices of Christ, and that all of these together are sacrifices in with the Master’s and will constitute the sealing of this Great Covenant, this Great Testament, through which the world is to be blessed during the thousand-year reign of The Christ, the antitype of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Inaugurating the New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The typical or Law Covenant was inaugurated at Mount Sinai by the typical mediatbnUMoses. Jts foundation was laid iniffiks th oral sacrifice of animals—bulls ah'cfple in thqe mediator sprinkling the blood &lt;Jr\«iead first upon the Book of'the Law and secondly upon the people. The sprinkling of the tables of the Law represented the satisfaction of Justice, that the mediator and his sacrifice were acceptable so far as God was concerned. The sprinkling of the people with the same blood represented their agreement to be obedient to God and to accept the mediator. The antitype </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">these things belongs to the Gospel Age. As shown in the types, the first sacrifice of the sin-offering was that of the bullock, which was not for all the people, but simply </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">“the household </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">faith,” including </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Church, which is the “Body </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Christ.” This sacrifice was fulfilled </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">our Lord Jesus at Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sacrifice of the goat-class has been</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">vjdual who will accept it of the merit of Christ’s sacrifice, so that as a result all mankind may come back, if they will, into full fellowship and harmony with God. However, the Scriptures clearly indicate to us that not all will respond, that some will refuse Divine mercy and favor even after they have had full knowledge and full opportunity, and that for these the Lord provides the Second Death —they “shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Mount Sinai and Mount Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. The Lord pictures before our minds the installation of these two covenants, pointing the one out as type and the other as an antitype. (See Hebrews 12:18-29.) He indicates that as the Law Covenant, the type, was instituted at Mount Sinai, its thunder and lightnipg and terrible sights and sounds were all typical or allegorical of ,the yet more striking, more wonderful events which will attend the inauguration of the New Covenant; and as this inauguration of the New Covenant is, we believe, nigh, even at the door, and to be expected within the next few years, it may be profitable for us to consider carefully just what the type may teach us under the guidance of the Apostle’s words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Israelites had for some time been approaching Mount Sinai, and, being </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">large company, would not all reach there at the same time. Likewise, the Church has been approaching Mount Zion, the Kingdom of Zion, for which we pray: ’ “Thy Kingdom come”—the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. For nearly 1,900 years the faithful in Christ Jesus have been marching onward to Mount Zion, which is to be the general rendezvous, the meeting, place, for all the “General Assembly of the Church of the First-born, whose names are written in Heaven?’ There they not -only will meet God, the Judge of all, but ultimately also meet all the perfect ones, with Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant. At that time the sprinkling of <sup>: </sup>the blood of the New Covenant will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">order. To come under that sprinkling will not mean vengeance, as the blood of Abel called for vengeance; to come under the blood, of Christ will mean i mercy, because His blood was shed as ' our Redemption Price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pointing back to the type, the Apostle says that the Lord’s voice, then, at Sinai, shook the earth. Pointing next to the installation of the New Covenant, now near at hand, he declared that God has promised that at this time He will not , only shake the earth, but also heaven, i We can readily see that the terms ' “heaven? and “earth,” in this case, are used in a figurative </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font6"> symbolical sense. . True, the physical earth may be shaken . considerably, as it certainly was literally ' shaken at Mount Sinai; but we cannot ■ think of Heaven, God’s dwelling place, ' </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">being shaken in any sense. Evidently i the symbolical heavens and earth are here . meant—namely, the “heavens,” ecclesi- ' astical powers; the “earth,” social organization or civilization. Both are to be shaken here, and the Apostle’s language clearly shows that the shaking is not to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font6">trifling matter; the Lord will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">so ' </span><span class="font6">thoroughly shake the ecclesiastical pow- ' ers and the social systems of earth that ‘ everything that can be shaken, every- • thing that is not fixedly established upon principles of Righteousness and Truth will &lt;&nbsp;be thoroughly shaken loose, overthrown, : destroyed. With the amount of error and ; falsity there is in the world, in religion, ' in politics, in business, in society, every- : where, we can readily see that this will mean a terrible shaking of present institutions: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“A </span><span class="font6">time of trouble such as was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">since there was a nation.”—Daniel 12:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That we may get the force of the mat- &lt;&nbsp;ter, the Apostle pictures allegorically the ; t.r.??sts and darkness and frightful « sounds which occurred at Mount Sinai, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font6">As there the least contact with the moun- : tain brought death, so here everything • in conflict with the Kingdom, Mount Zion, &lt;&nbsp;will suffer. As in the type blackness and ' darkness and tempests and sound of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a • </span><span class="font6">trumpet caused terror, so here in the an-: titype there will be fearful sights, terrible s scenes in the end of this Age, in the '</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">whereby we may serve God acceptably.” Let us realize that now is the time for service, the time for sacrificing, the time we have pledged ourselves to walk in the narrow way, to faithfully lay down our lives, thus participating with Him, our Lord and Head, in His cup, that we may also be accounted worthy to participate with Him in HiS glories soon to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle concludes his statement With a further reference to God, with whom the mediation is made. He declares, “For our God is a consuming fire.” The picture he thus thrusts before our minds carries us back to the illustration at Mount Sinai, where the Lord manifests Himself to the people as a consuming fire at the top of the mountain. The lesson thus enforced is that God’s opposition burns against all iniquity, all unrighteousness, all sin. He cannot look upon it with allowance; His sentence against sin is destruction. We are all sinners, and all justly under this sentence of destruction, the fire of God’s anger, righteous indignation; but He is merciful, also, and has provided a way of escape—Jesus, the Way, the Truth, the Life. The Church of this Gospel Age is invited to associate with Him; but if any man love darkness rather than light, if when he comes to discern righteousness and sin in their true character, true colors, he is not disposed to accept the side</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">mercy, long suffering and patience the Lord has for those who are even stum-blingly seeking to walk in the ways of righteousness and in the footsteps of Jesus, and however broad the provision He has made that ultimately every creature shall have the knowledge and opportunity of coming into accord with Himself through Christ, under the New Covenant, nevertheless, the “wages of sin is death,” and all who love unrighteousness must expect to perish before the consuming fire of Divine Justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We who now taste of the good things of God’s favor in advance of the world, in connection with pur “high calling” and privilege of joint-suffering and jointheirship with Christ, must remember that the Almighty is not to be trifled with; that if we wilfully reject His mercies and favors He will be toward us as a consuming fire. Likewise, the world in the coming Age must learn that if they sin wilfully, if they refuse to go on and attain perfection, if they reject the mercy of God, through the Lord Jesus, they must expect no further mercy, no mercy outside of Him and the Divine order and arrangement of which He is the recognized Head—they shall die The Death, they shall be “utterly destroyed from among the people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ALL men realize that they come short ** of perfection. Additionally, nearly all realize that in the past of their lives lie crimes more or less serious. In the majority of minds fear is instinctive. Under proper limitations it is a healthy condition. “Let us fear lest a promise being left us of entering into His [Divine] rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.” “The fear [reverence] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”—Hebrews 4:1; Psalm 111:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the Adversary has taken advantage of this proper and wholesome fear through what the Apostle t?rmji “doctrines of devils.” Thus from infancy an abnormal, irrational fear has obtained a lodgment in nearly every mind, heathen and civilized. Of this fear the Lord, through the Prophet, says, “Their fear toward Me is taught by the precepts of men.” (Isaiah 29:13.) These “precepts of men,” or human traditions, have grossly misrepresented God and His Word; and alas! many, even Bible students, are seriously handicapped by these devilish theories established in a period of ignorance and superstition, but supposed to be based upon the Divine Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Time of Restitution Is Day of Judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Amongst other false theories respecting the Second Coming of Christ we have the view held by our Adventist brethren, that the moment of the Lord’s coming will be the “crack of doom” to the world and the inhabitants thereof—marking the end Of hope for all not.previo.usly brought into relationship with God through Christ, as saints. Adventists are not alone in this theory. Practically the creeds of all denominations teach the same thought, the very reverse of the Scripture presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Peter describes the time of the Sec</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ond </span><span class="font6">Advent and the blessings that will then come to mankind. He says, “Times </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">refreshing [greenness—springtime] </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font6">come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the Heaven must receive [retain], until the Times of Restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the world began.” —Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures teach that Christ Jesus and His glorified Church will together ‘‘judge the world.” (Acts 17:31; 1 Corinthians 6:2.) The judging of the world is commonly supposed to signify a con-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">(3) This offer, or opportunity for the Church, has separated from the world all those who accept this High Calling. They become spirit-begotten children of God, and, prospectively, joint-heirs with Jesus. They now share with the Redeemer in sacrificing the earthly life, and, if faith, ful, will by and by be granted a share with Him in the glorious work of His Kingdom—the judging of the world—tie giving of the world a fair, impartial trial for life everlasting or death everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Who Shall Stand When He Appeareth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, there is another side, to this question. The Scriptures indicate that at His Second Coming only the saintly ones v/ill be ready to receive the Master with joy; that at that time the masses of mankind will be so associated with sin and injustice that, instead of being worthy of His approval, their course in life will come under reprobation and stripes. Hence, it is written, &quot;Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you”; “Woe unto you that are full now.”—James 5:1; Luke 6:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Babylon the Great is to fall; and the wonderful institutions of civilization which are partly good and partly bad. will be found only partly satisfactory to the new King and the rulers of His Government. This will mean that many who are now stewards of wealth, influence and position, honored of men, etc., will be called to account and dispossessed of their stewardship. Their realization of then</span></p>

If God had shown no mercy, there would have been no redemption and no future judgment. The trial of Adam six thousand</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">years ago had its result and its penalty, under which sin and death have reigned for six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having provided the Redeemer, God is about to establish the Messianic Kingdom lor the very purpose of giving to all humanity a special, personal opportunity for reformation, uplift, sanctification and the attainment thus of life everlasting.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“He Shall Judge the World In Righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From this standpoint, the apprehen</span><span class="font6">sions of mankind are well based in respect to th^ Great King’s disapproval of much that is carried on in the world in the name of civilization, yea, in the Master’s own name! But let us not dwell, too much upon this side of the question.’ “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.” Let us rather point men </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font6">glorious silver lining of that dark cloud which draws daily nearer and nearer. Let us p .t men to the glorious blessings of Messiah’s Kingdom, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and teach them to </span><span class="font6">pray, <sup>,f</sup>Thy Kingdom come, Thy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wiH be </span><span class="font6">done,” and to strive </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">understand </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">appreciate the principles governing that Kingdom; peradventure they may pass through </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the time of trouble with the less </span><span class="font6">injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hearken to the words of the Prophet (referring not at all to the Church, which is accounted worthy to escape those things coming upon the world, but speaking to mankind in general, and exhorting the better element of the world), “Seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be that ye shall be hid in the Day of the Lord’s anger.” (Zephaniah 2:3.) It surely will be true that the more meek and more righteous men may be, the better they will be prepared for the awful shook and terrible distress of that Day of trouble, which as a plowshare will prepare the hearts of mankind to receive the good seed—the Message of Divine Truth and Grace, whiclp then </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">will be </span><span class="font6">made known</span></p>

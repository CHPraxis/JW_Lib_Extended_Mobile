<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people today are blessed with an abundance of rich spiritual food. (Isa. 25:6) There is much Scriptural material to enjoy through personal and family study and at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. But are we taking full advantage of all of this with a view to becoming “fully competent, completely equipped for every good work”?—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Just think of the spiritual menu for the year 1998, which is already half over! Through the weekly congregation meetings, we are covering some of the highlights of 23 books of the Christian Greek Scriptures, reviewing information found in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> concerning the lives of 49 Bible characters, and considering 138 pages in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers </span><span class="font11">book. We are also reviewing one third of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book, nearly all the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness </span><span class="font11">book, and the entire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word </span><span class="font11">book. Additionally, we are being nourished with 12 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> 52 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Wai ch-tower</span><span class="font11"> study articles, and nearly as many public talks on a variety of Bible subjects. Rich convention and assembly programs are In addition to all of this. What a wealth of spiritual good things has been made available to us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Appreciate Jehovah’s Provisions: </span><span class="font11">In order to benefit fully, we need to appreciate why Jehovah provides such a spiritual abundance. Feeding on these good things builds our faith and strengthens our relationship with him. (1 Tim. 4:6) However, spiritual food is not made available simply for our own instruction. It motivates us to share the truth with others and equips us to be effective in doing so as ministers of the good news.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Let us not neglect our spiritual needs, but always be cultivating a longing for the rich and spiritually satisfying provisions from Jehovah’s table. (Matt. 5:3; 1 Pet. 2:2) To benefit fully requires setting aside sufficient time for such important matters as regular personal and family Bible study and meeting attendance. (Eph. 5:15, 16) The happi-fying rewards for doing so will be in accord with the inspired encouragement that Paul wrote to faithful Hebrew Christians, as recorded at Hebrews 13:20, 21.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It Takes All of Us to Get the Work Done</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Every disciple of Jesus Christ should appreciate that his endeavors to support and participate in the Kingdom-preaching work are very important. Jesus realized that his disciples would produce Kingdom fruitage in varying quantities. (Matt. 13:23) Although a good portion of the preaching activity is being carried out by many hardworking pioneers, all who eagerly continue to glorify God by bearing as much fruit as possible are to be commended.—John 15:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Collective Efforts Accomplish Much: </span><span class="font11">Jesus foretold that the cumulative efforts of all his disciples would produce works greater than his. (John 14:12) Whether our personal circumstances limit what we can do or allow us to devote much time to Kingdom preaching, all of us are needed to get the work done. It is just as Paul stated: “All the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body.”—Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Some may feel that their efforts do not amount to much. However, in Jehovah’s eyes the important thing is that our service be whole-souled. Everything we do for him is valuable and appreciated.—Compare Luke 21: 1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Continue to Support the Work: </span><span class="font11">All of us have the privilege of contributing materially to the worldwide work. Some can also assist with the physical labor involved in supporting the Kingdom work. Each one can endeavor to give well-prepared comments at the meetings and participate in the Theocratic Ministry School. By taking advantage of opportunities to encourage others, we make a valuable contribution to the spirituality of the congregation, and this enhances its ability to accomplish the work entrusted to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Yes, it takes all of us to get the work done. No one should feel left out. Our combined efforts, both large and small, in serving Jehovah distinguish us as the only true worshipers of God. (Mal. 3:18) Each one of us can have a meaningful part in honoring Jehovah and in helping others to know and serve him.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In Bible times a steward held a position of great trust. Abraham gave his steward the task of finding a wife for his son, Isaac. (Gen. 24:1-4) In effect, the steward was responsible to ensure the continuance of Abraham’s line. What a responsibility! No wonder the apostle Paul said: “What is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful”!—1 Cor. 4:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Stewardship</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Some aspects of the Christian ministry are described in the Bible as stewardships. For example, the apostle Paul spoke to the Ephesians of “the stewardship of the undeserved kindness of God that was given me with you in view.” (Eph. 3:2; Col. 1:25) He viewed his commission to carry the good news to the nations as a stewardship that he had to handle faithfully. (Acts 9:15; 22:21) The apostle Peter wrote to his anointed brothers: “Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.” (1 Pet. 4:9,10; Heb. 13:16) Whatever those first-century Christians possessed in a material way was a result of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. They were, therefore, stewards of those things and needed to use them in a Christian way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses have a similar view of matters. They have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God and view all they have—their lives, their physical strength, their material belongings—as fruits of “God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.” As fine stewards, they feel accountable to Jehovah God for the way they use these things. In addition, they have been given a knowledge of the good news. This too is a trust that they desire to use in the finest way possible: to magnify Jehovah’s name and to help others come to a knowledge of the truth—Matt. 28:19,20; 1 Tim. 2:3,4; 2 Tim. 1:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How are Jehovah’s Witnesses discharging their responsibilities as stewards? The annual report shows that last year alone, worldwide they spent more than one billion hours preaching the “good news of the kingdom” and conducted more than 4,500,000 home Bible studies with interested persons. (Matt. 24:14) Their faithfulness as Jehovah’s stewards was also shown by their generous contributions toward the worldwide work and in support of local Kingdom Halls, by their hospitality to traveling overseers and others, and by their extraordinary kindness to those in great need—such as victims of armed conflicts. As a group, true Christians are caring well for the Master’s belongings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Faithful Steward, the Discreet One”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Stewardship exists not only on an individual but also on an organizational level. Jesus called the anointed Christian congregation on earth “the faithful steward, the discreet one.” (Luke 12:42) The responsibility of this “faithful steward” is to provide “food supplies” and to take the lead in the international preaching of the good news. (Rev. 12:17) Related to this, the faithful steward class, represented by the Governing Body, has a God-given responsibility to manage properly its material and spiritual “talents.” (Matt. 25:15) In harmony with ‘the faithful steward’s’ example, individual branch corporations make every effort to use all financial contributions in a responsible manner, to further Kingdom interests. All such donations are made on trust, and “the faithful steward, the discreet one” is responsible to ensure that they are used for the purpose intended and that they are handled wisely, economically, and to good effect.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> An example of the wise use of contributed funds is seen in the growth of the printing activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses during the 20th century. Distribution of Bibles as well as Bible literature —magazines, books, brochures, booklets, tracts, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News—</span><span class="font12">has played a major role in the spreading of “the good news” during these “last days.” (Mark 13: 10; 2 Tim. 3:1) And the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine has been a major instrument in supplying “food at the proper time” to “the household of God” and their companions, the “great crowd” of “other sheep.” —Matt. 24:45; Eph. 2:19; Rev. 7:9; John 10:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Initially, all the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses was produced by commercial printers. But during the 1920’s, it was decided that it would be more efficient and spiritually beneficial if Jehovah’s servants did their own printing. Starting in a small way in 1920, the printing work gradually grew in Brooklyn, New York, until it became very large. By 1967 the printing facilities covered four city blocks. Printing had also been undertaken in other lands, but in most of them, it had been interrupted by World War II. .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> However much the printing operation in the United States grew, it was never big enough to supply the whole world. Therefore, in the years following the war, printing operations were set up or were already under way in many other countries, including Canada, Denmark, England, Greece, South Africa, Switzerland, and West Germany. By the early 1970’s, Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ghana, Japan, Nigeria, and the Philippines had been added to the list. Some of these countries also produced bound books. Also in the early 1970’s, Gilead missionaries were trained in printing skills and sent to some of these lands to help the local brothers with the printing work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> During the 1980’s, the number of countries in which magazines were printed reached a peak of 51.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup> What a fine use of the Master’s belongings all of this turned out to be! What strong evidence of the growth of the Kingdom work! And what a powerful testimony to the generous support of millions of individual Witnesses of Jehovah who ‘honored Jehovah with their valuable things’! (Prov. 3:9) Thus, they proved themselves to be fine stewards of what Jehovah had blessed them with in various ways.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Change in Focus</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, great advances were made in printing technology, and Jehovah’s Witnesses adopted newer printing techniques. Previously, they had used the traditional letterpress style of printing. This gradually changed as they began to adopt the more modern offset printing. As a result, beautiful publications are being produced with full-color illustrations, instead of the two-color pictures (black plus one other color) that were possible on the old letter presses. Further, computer technology changed the whole prepress operation (preparation for printing). Jehovah’s Witnesses developed a Multilanguage Electronic Phototypesetting System (MEPS), a computerized system that now supports printing in more than 370 different languages. No commercial program matches MEPS in its capacity to function in so many languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Thanks to MEPS computer technology and use of such other innovations as electronic mail, another great advance was made in producing food at the proper time. Previously, using the older technology, non-English-language magazines contained information months or even a year after the English. Now, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> appears simultaneously in 115 different languages, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> in 62. This means that worldwide over 95 percent of those attending the weekly </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">Study of Jehovah’s Witnesses consider the same material at the same time. What a blessing this is! It was surely a fine use of the Master’s belongings to invest in all of that new technology!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Different Organizational Need*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> These new systems changed the organizational needs of the worldwide printing operations of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The web offset presses are much faster than the old letterpresses, but they are also much more expensive. Computer systems that support related work, such as writing, translation, art, and graphics, while offering far more possibilities than the old systems, are also more costly. It soon became apparent that it was no longer cost-effective to print magazines in 51 different countries. Hence, in the 1990’s, “the faithful steward” took another look at things. What was the conclusion?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> Studies indicated that the “valuable things” contributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses and their friends would be better spent if the printing work was consolidated. So the number of printing branches was gradually reduced. Germany has taken over the printing of magazines and literature for many lands in Eastern and Western Europe, including some that had previously handled their own printing. Italy supplies magazines and literature to parts of Africa and southeastern Europe, including Greece and Albania. In Africa, magazine printing has been limited to Nigeria and South Africa. Similar consolidation occurred around the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Factors to Weigh</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> By July 1998, printing of magazines will have been discontinued in a number of European countries, including Austria, Denmark, France, Greece, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The burden of printing in Europe will be carried by Britain, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. In this way, unnecessary expenses will be avoided and contributions used in a better way for the worldwide work. How was it decided which countries would continue as printing locations and which would cease to print? In keeping with its mandate to care wisely for the Master’s belongings, “the faithful steward” carefully evaluated the practicality of printing in each location.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> The overwhelming reason why printing was discontinued in some countries and consolidated in others was practicality. To have one country print literature for several other lands is more convenient and is a better use of expensive equipment. Printing is now being done where the costs are lower, materials are available, and shipping facilities are good. Thus, the Master’s belongings are being properly used. Of course, ceasing to print in a country does not mean that the preaching work there will stop. There will still be an abundant supply of printed matter available, and the hundreds of thousands of Witnesses of Jehovah in those lands will keep on zealously telling their neighbors “the good news of peace.” (Eph. 2:17) Moreover, this reorganization has resulted in other benefits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> To cite one benefit, most of the modern presses from Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were sent to Nigeria and the Philippines. Skilled operators from the European countries accepted the invitation to go with the presses and train the local operators in their use. Hence, those countries are now getting the same high-quality magazines that other lands have had.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> Consider another benefit: The cost of printing magazines is now borne in the few lands where printing continues. As a result, in lands where printing has been discontinued, resources are now available for other purposes, such as building Kingdom Halls and helping to care for the needs of our brothers in poorer lands. Thus, careful use of the Master’s belongings means that Paul’s words to the Corinthians can be applied more effectively on an international scale: “I do not mean for it to be easy for others, but hard on you; but that by means of an equalizing your surplus just now might offset their deficiency . . . that an equalizing might take place.”—2 Cor. 8:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> As a result of this consolidation, Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world are linked together more closely than ever before. It is not a problem for the Witnesses in Denmark to have their magazines printed in Germany, although they used to print their own. They are grateful for the service of their German brothers. Do Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany resent the fact that their contributions are being used to provide Bible literature for Denmark—or for Russia, Ukraine, and other lands? Of course not! They are happy to know that the contributions of theit brothers in those lands can now be used for other necessary purposes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Caring for the Belonging*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>19</sup> In every Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world, there is a contribution box marked “Contributions for the Society’s Worldwide Work—Matthew 24:14.” Unsolicited contributions placed in those boxes are available for use wherever there is a need. How the contributions are used is decided by “the faithful steward” and individual branch corporations. Hence, where permitted by law, money placed in a contribution box in one country might support the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses in another country thousands of miles away. Contributions have been used in some lands to provide emergency aid for fellow believers suffering because of such things as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and civil wars. And such donations are being used to support missionaries in well over 200 lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> In the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, as a general rule, financial matters are mentioned just once a month —and only for a few minutes. No collection plates are passed in Kingdom Halls or at assemblies. No solicitations for funds are sent to individuals. No fundraisers are hired. Normally, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> has just one article a year explaining how those who so desire can make contributions to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in order to support the worldwide work. There is no regular mention of Society finances in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">How, then, has the enormous worldwide work of preaching the good news, building necessary Kingdom Halls, caring for those in special full-time service, and giving aid to Christians in need been accomplished? Jehovah has blessed his people in a wonderful way with a spirit of generosity. (2 Cor. 8:2) We take this opportunity to thank all who have had a share in ‘honoring Jehovah with their valuable things.’ They can be sure that “the faithful steward” will continue to watch over the Master’s belongings. And we pray that Jehovah will continue to bless all the arrangements made for the expansion of the worldwide work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing by Good Conduct</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In today’s permissive society, many young people recklessly squander their lives on drugs, immorality, rebellion, and violence. By contrast, the exemplary conduct of wholesome young people in the Christian congregation is refreshing to behold and is surely a thing of beauty to Jehovah. It serves as a powerful witness that may draw others to the truth.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many experiences show that the good conduct of Christian youths has had a positive impact on observers. Speaking about a young Witness who was her student, a schoolteacher told the entire class that this girl’s God, Jehovah, is the true God. She said this because the girl’s conduct is always respectful. Another teacher wrote the Society, saying: “I would like to commend you for the fine young people you have in your religion.... Your youths are really an example. They respect their elders, are polite, and are modestly dressed. And how they know their Bibles! That truly is religion!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Another schoolteacher was impressed by the fine conduct of a seven-year-old Witness in her class. She was drawn to the boy’s mild and pleasing personality, which made him stand out in stark contrast to other boys. She was struck by his serious attitude toward his religious beliefs—he was not embarrassed to be different because of what he believed. She could see that his conscience had been trained and that he was able “to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) Eventually, the boy’s mother visited the teacher, and a Bible study was started. In time, the teacher was baptized and later became a regular pioneer!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> One young man was influenced by the good conduct of a Witness in his school. She was truly different—very polite, studious, and always modest in her dress; also, unlike other girls, she never flirted with the boys. He could see that she was living by Bible principles. The young man asked her questions about her religious beliefs and was impressed with what he learned. He began to study, was soon baptized, and eventually shared in the pioneer ministry and in Bethel service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If you are a young Christian who desires to give a fine witness to others, watch your conduct in every way. Never let your guard down by becoming sympathetic toward the world’s permissive attitudes, views, or life-styles. Set an elevated example in your speech, dress, and grooming, not only while participating in the field ministry and at congregation meetings but also while at school and when engaging in recreation. (1 Tim. 4:12) You will have real joy when someone takes an interest in the truth because you have been ‘letting your light shine’ through your good conduct.—Matt. 5:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Witnessing to “All Sorts of Men”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we meet people of diverse cultures or religious backgrounds, we remember that Jehovah's will is “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) In addition to a number of specially prepared tracts and brochures, we have two excellent publications that can be used at any time to help individuals whose religious training has not taught them the truth about God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> gives insight into the origin of the world’s major religions and can thereby be helpful to people everywhere in making a comparison between their beliefs and what the Bible teaches about the only true God. On the other hand, by highlighting the life of Jesus Christ, the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font11"> can help a person to become better acquainted with the Son of God and be drawn to him, as were many people in the first century. (John 12:32) Whenever appropriate, you may wish to try the following suggestions for introducing these books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you think it would be good to offer the “Greatest Man” book to someone, you might ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “What comes to your mind when you think of Jesus Christ? [Allow for response.] Many historians acknowledge Jesus as the greatest man who ever lived. [Quote an example from the introduction in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man </span><span class="font11">book.] The Bible shows that Jesus’ life was a model for us to imitate.” Read 1 Peter 2:21 and the first paragraph on the last page of the introduction in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book. If the householder is interested in learning about Jesus, offer the book. Before you leave, read John 17:3 and ask, “How can we take in this knowledge that leads to everlasting life?” Make definite arrangements to return with the answer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When you return to explain how to take in Ufe-gMng knowledge, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “I promised to return to show you how we can take in the knowledge that leads to everlasting life.” Present the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font11">book, and using the first chapter, demonstrate a study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you wish to offer the book “Mankind’s Search for God,” you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “With so many different religions today, have you ever wondered how we can determine which one is approved by God?” After a response, open the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> book to page 377. Highlight point number 7, and ask if the householder agrees that the true religion should unite all races of mankind. Look up one of the cited scriptures, and as time permits, discuss some of the other points in the list. If there is genuine interest, offer the book. When leaving, you could ask, “How should true religion affect a person’s conduct?” Arrange for a return visit to answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> When you return to explain how true religion affects a person’s life, you might ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “How do you think religion should affect people’s conduct? [Allow for response.] Christ gave us a standard by which religion should be measured.” Read Matthew 7:17-20 directly from page 12 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> book. Then invite the householder to read paragraph 20 on pages 13-14. If time allows, discuss paragraphs 25-9 on pages 16-18. This may lead into a study in either the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font11">book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Conversation Starters: </span><span class="font11">There are many teaching aids in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> book that may be used as conversation starters on the initial call or return visit. You can begin a conversation simply by asking an appropriate question. For example, note these questions and topics and the pages where they are addressed:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;Questions That Require an Answer&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—pages 17-18.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> You can turn to the selected page(s) in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> book and explain the point being discussed. Then set up a return visit by asking a follow-up question that can be answered from either the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book. Be sure to invite the householder to the Public Meeting and leave a handbill.

<p><span class="font11">’All sorts of honesthearted people are searching for the truth about God and Christ. We can assist them in our witness work. So, then, let us keep on “working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men.” —1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Millions of people are studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. In order to qualify for life everlasting, they must ‘embrace the word heartily,’ as did the 3,000 who repented and were baptized on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. (Acts 2:41) What responsibility does this place upon us today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We need to help our Bible students develop devotion to Jehovah. (1 Tim. 4:7-10) To that end, the June 1996 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> insert, paragraph 20, suggests: “Throughout the course of the study, look for opportunities to build appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities. Express your own deep feelings for God. Help the stu</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Word Heartily’!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">dent think in terms of developing a warm, personal relationship with Jehovah.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Challenge We Face: </span><span class="font11">Most people, influenced by false religion, are content with a form of worship that involves minimal time and effort, without requiring any real change in their way of life. (2 Tim. 3:5) The challenge facing us is to help our Bible students to see that true worship involves more than just being hearers of the word of God. They must apply in their lives what they learn. (Jas. 1:22-25) If something about their personal conduct is not acceptable to God, they need to recognize their obligation to “turn around” and do what is right to please him. (Acts 3:19) To gain eternal life, they must ‘exert themselves vigorously’ and take a firm stand for the truth.—Luke 13:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■•When discussing various aspects of morality, ask your Bible student how he really views these matters and what he should do if he sees a need to make changes in his life. Direct his attention to the organization through which he is learning the truth, and encourage him to attend congregation meetings regularly.—Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Let us make it our aim to reach the student’s heart with our teaching. We will rejoice as we motivate new ones to embrace God’s word heartily and get baptized!—1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Build One Another Up by Commenting at Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We are exhorted at Hebrews 10:24 to ‘incite one another to love and fine works.’ This includes building one another up by making meaningful comments at congregation meetings. Why should we comment? How can we do this? Who stand to benefit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Think of the many times you benefit from hearing others offer simple, clear expressions that enhance your understanding and strengthen you spiritually. You have the privilege of doing the same for them. When you participate, you demonstrate your desire to “impart some spiritual gift” for the encouragement of all who are in attendance.—Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Make Good Comments: </span><span class="font11">Do not offer long comments, covering every thought in the paragraph. Lengthy comments usually fail to pinpoint the specific answer and may discourage others from sharing. The first comment on the paragraph should be a brief, direct answer to the printed question. Those offering additional comments can then make practical application of the material or show how the scriptures apply. See the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook, </span><span class="font11">pages 90-2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If the thought of commenting causes you some anxiety, prepare a brief comment beforehand, and ask the conductor to call on you for that paragraph. After you do this at a few meetings, participating will become easier. Recall that Moses and Jeremiah expressed lack of confidence in their ability to speak in public. (Ex. 4:10; Jer. 1:6, ftn.) But Jehovah helped them to speak on his behalf, and he will help you too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Who Will Benefit From Your Comments? </span><span class="font11">You yourself benefit because your comments impress the truth more firmly on your mind and heart, making it easier for you to recall the information later. Also, others benefit from hearing your upbuilding expressions. We are encouraged when all, whether experienced, young, shy, or new, make the effort to express their faith at congregation meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We are sure to find that ‘words at the right time are O how good’ when they are used to build one another up at the meetings!—Prov. 15:23.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>We Surpassed the Million Mark!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Year Ends With New Peak of 1,040,283 Publishers Reporting</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“One Million!” was the call in the July </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font0"> The 1,040,283 publishers reporting answered that call. This is an increase of 64,454, or 6.6 percent, over the previous peak in August 1996. We pray Jehovah’s continued blessing on our efforts to proclaim his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Elders, ministerial servants, and all publishers alike are urged to reflect on the efforts that were involved in reaching this goal. The million plus publishers are already with us in the congregations. And there are more to come each month as we continue to carry on an effective ministry. However, good organization for field service, coupled with kindly personal assistance where needed, is vital for further progress. We look to Jehovah for his allimportant blessing so that growth will be maintained.—1 Cor. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the elders and ministerial servants —especially those who are Congregation Book Study conductors—along with other mature publishers and pioneers keep up the special effort they demonstrated during August, Jehovah’s rich blessing will surely be reflected in continued publisher increases. At times all that is needed is a kindly reminder to have a share in the preaching work and then perhaps another reminder to turn in the report. The suggestions outlined in the following insert article, “Be Effective in Your Ministry,” should help us improve in our activity and increase our joy as we experience fine results from our efforts.</span></p>

In some territories, the early afternoon, rather than the morning, may be the best time to meet for field service. Such adjustments may well contribute to increased productivity in the door-to-door work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Be Discerning andiractful; </span><span class="font0">As we contact people from door to door, we encounter a variety of reactions to our message. Some householders are receptive, others are indifferent, and a few may be argumentative or belligerent. In the case of the latter, on page 7 of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures, we</span><span class="font0"> are reminded that we are not seeking to ‘“win arguments’ with people who show no respect for the truth.” If the householder is hostile, it is best for us to take our leave. We should never antagonize people by insisting that they talk with us or accept our point of view. We do not force our message on people. That would not be reasonable and could cause problems for other Witnesses and for the work in general.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">’Before starting to work in a territory, it is wise to check the territory card for notations of addresses where the residents have told us not to call. If there are such addresses, each publisher working that street should be told where not to call. No one should take it upon himself to call on these homes without the service overseer’s direction to do so.—See the June 1994 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font0"> Question Box.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> We can increase our effectiveness by being discerning as we work from house to house. Be observant as you approach a home. Are all the curtains or blinds closed? Is there no sound of activity? This may indicate that the occupants are sleeping. Likely, we will have a more productive conversation with the householder if we call back later. Perhaps it would be best to pass by this home for the time being, making note of the house number. You could check the house again before leaving the territory or make a note to call again at a later hour.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Situations may still arise in which we inadvertently awaken someone or otherwise disturb him. He may even appear to be irritated or angry. How should we react? Proverbs 17:27 counsels: “A man of discernment is cool of spirit.” While we do not apologize for our ministry, we can certainly express how sorry we are that we have called at an inconvenient time. We can politely ask if another time would be more convenient and offer to return. A sincere expression of personal concern in a mild voice often serves to relax such a person. (Prov. 15:1) If a householder informs us that he regularly works a night shift, a note could be included with the territory card so that future calls may be made at an appropriate time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>12</sup> Discernment is also appropriate as we endeavor to work our territory thoroughly. Since many people are not at home when we first call, we need to make additional efforts to contact them to share the message of salvation with them. (Rom. 10:13) Reports indicate that sometimes publishers call at the same home several times in one day to try to find the people at home. This does not escape the attention of the neighbors. An unfavorable impression may be created that Jehovah’s Witnesses are ‘always calling’ on their street. How can this be avoided?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> Use discernment. When calling again on a not-at-home, are there indications that someone is home now? If mail or fliers are sticking out of the mailbox, it is likely that the person is still not at home and a further call at the door would not be productive at this time. If the person cannot be contacted after a few attempts made at different times of day, such as in the evening, it may be possible to contact the householder by telephone. If not, a tract or handbill can be discreetly left in the door, especially if the territory is covered reasonably often. It may well be that the person can be contacted the next time the territory is worked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>14</sup> We should avoid extended conversations at the door when the householder is exposed to inclement weather. When invited inside, be careful not to soil the floors. Use good judgment when challenged by a barking dog. When working in apartment buildings, speak softly and avoid making noise that disturbs tenants and announces your presence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Be Orderly and Dignified: </span><span class="font0">With good organization we can avoid forming large, highly visible groups that congregate in the territory. Some householders may feel threatened when several cars and vans arrive in front of their house with a large group of publishers. We do not want to give the impression that we are “invading” residential areas. Arrangements for working the territory are best made at the meeting for field service. Small groups of publishers, such as a family, are far less intimidating to the householders and need less reorganization as the territory is worked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>16</sup> Orderliness requires that parents carefully supervise the conduct of their children while working in the territory. Children should be well behaved when accompanying adults to the door. Youngsters should not be allowed to play or to wander freely, attracting undue attention from residents or passersby.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>17</sup> Balance is needed, too, in the matter of coffee breaks. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font0"> June 1995, page 3, stated: “When we are out in field service, we can lose valuable time on coffee breaks. However, when weather conditions are severe, a break will refresh us and help us to keep going. Many, though, prefer to keep busy witnessing to people and forgo socializing with the brothers on coffee breaks during the time that has been set aside for the ministry.” Although stopping for refreshments is a personal decision, it has been noted that at times, large groups of brothers and sisters meet at a coffee shop or a restaurant. Besides the amount of time taken to be served, the presence of a crowd can be intimidating to other patrons. Sometimes, experiences of the morning’s field service are loudly discussed, and this can detract from the dignity of our ministry and impair its effectiveness. With discernment, publishers can avoid overcrowding an establishment and taking unnecessary time from the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>18</sup> Many have experienced fine results by approaching people wherever they may be found—on streets, in parking lots, and in other public places. Here, too, we want to give a fine witness, not only by our words but also by our reasonableness. Publishers in each congregation should be sure to respect their territory boundaries so that they are not overwhelming pedestrians in commercial areas and subway entrances or employees in businesses, such as gas stations, that are open 24 hours. To ensure that we carry out our ministry in an orderly, dignified manner, we would work only within our own territory assignment unless some specific arrangements have been made through the Congregation Service Committee of another congregation, to provide them with some assistance.—Compare 2 Corinthians 10:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>19</sup> Some congregations with many areas where public witnessing is possible have organized these areas into territories. A territory card is then issued to an individual publisher or a group. This facilitates more effective coverage and guards against too many publishers working in the same area at the same time, in harmony with the principle at 1 Corinthians 14: 40: “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>20</sup> Our personal appearance should always be dignified and representative of ministers bearing Jehovah’s name. The same is true of the equipment we use. Worn-out book bags and dog-eared or soiled Bibles detract from the Kingdom message. It has been said that dress and grooming “are a social shorthand that gives the surrounding population information about who and what you are and where you fit in the order of things.” Hence, our appearance should be neither slovenly nor unkempt, neither flashy nor extravagant, but always “worthy of the good news.”—Phil. 1:27; compare 1 Timothy 2:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>21</sup> At 1 Corinthians 9:26, the apostle Paul states: “The way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.” In imitation of Paul, we are determined to have an effective, productive ministry. As we have a zealous share in the witnessing work as part of Jehovah’s “locust army” today, may we use Christian reasonableness and discernment in taking the message of salvation to all in our territory.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Opportunities for travel abroad have become more readily available in recent years. As a result, many of our brothers have arranged to visit other countries.

The branch offices are pleased to provide Kingdom Hall addresses and meeting times to assist in contacting local congregations. Also, they can give direction about visiting the branch office. Reports indicate, however, that many additional inquiries are made about travel arrangements, rooming accommodations, local attractions, and similar matters. Branch offices are not equipped, neither do they have the time, to supply information of this type. Visitors are encouraged to consult such sources as travel agents or tourist bureaus, which normally provide information for tourists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■</span><span class="font0"> Is it still appropriate to conduct a home Bible study with an inactive brother or sister at the direction of one of the members of the Congregation Service Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The elders have the responsibility to shepherd the congregation, including any members who have become inactive. They visit such ones and determine what personal assistance is needed. Where appropriate, this could include offering the inactive one the benefit of a personal Bible study. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, </span><span class="font0">page 103, explains that the Congregation Service Committee would decide who might benefit from such a provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The service overseer determines who could best provide the assistance, what subjects should be studied, and which publication would be the most helpful. Perhaps the one who originally studied with the person or someone he has known and respected would be in a good position t;o help. A capable and mature sister may be asked to assist an inactive sister. Usually it would not be necessary for another publisher to accompany the assigned conductor. When assigned, the publisher conducting the study may count the time, the return visits, and the study.—See November 1987 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font0"> pages 1-2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the student is a baptized person, generally the study need not be continued for a prolonged period of time. The goal is to assist the inactive one to resume attendance at all congregation meetings and to become a regular publisher of the good news. The service overseer will monitor the progress of such studies. The result of this loving assistance should be that these brothers and sisters will be able to shoulder their own load of responsibility before Jehovah and become firmly “rooted and established” in the truth. —Eph. 3:17; Gal. 6:5.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>nt a Bible Stud</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Many of us have expressed a desire for a Bible study, and for good reason. The Bible study work is where we achieve our goal of making new disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) And yet many of us have gone for months, perhaps years, without experiencing the special joy that comes from teaching someone the truth. What can we do about this during November? Since the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book is being featured this month, we can make a special effort to use it to start new Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Set Aside One or More Weekends: </span><span class="font11">We encourage everyone to set aside some time this month to concentrate on starting a new Bible study. Congregation Book Study conductors should select the weekend(s) to be used specifically for this purpose and then organize their groups to put forth a concerted effort in the return visit work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Bring your return visit records with you to these meetings for service. Then call on all of those who have shown interest, taken literature, or attended meetings. Make each call with the specific purpose of starting a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Demonstrate a Bible Study: </span><span class="font11">At the selected meetings for service, a well-prepared demonstration should be presented, showing how to start a study on a return visit. You might say: “Many people have a Bible, but they do not realize that it holds the answers to the important questions we all face in life. [Show the table of contents in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knoioledge</span><span class="font11"> book, and read the titles of chapters 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.] Using this study aid for an hour or so a week, you can gain a basic understanding of the Bible in just a few months. If you would like to pick one of these topics, I would be happy to show you how the program works.” If the person hesitates to study because of having a busy schedule, explain that we also have an abbreviated program. Introduce the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure, and offer to study one brief lesson a week for 15-30 minutes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If we all make a united effort to start studies and if we pray for Jehovah’s blessing upon our endeavor, we will surely find new studies! (1 John 5:14, 15) If you want a Bible study, this may be your opportunity to start one.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>—TriG rneocratic Ministry school oversoer</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School overseer is a spiritually older man who works hard in speaking and teaching and who deserves our honor and cooperation. (1 Tim. 5:17) What are his responsibilities?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School library at the Kingdom Hall comes under his care. He is keenly interested in encouraging all who qualify to enroll in the school. He sees to it that an accurate record is kept so that assignments are made in an orderly fashion at least three weeks in advance of each school session. He needs to know the congregation well, having in mind each student and his capabilities. Although he may have another brother assist him in preparing the school schedule, assigning the parts properly takes the overseer’s personal supervision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In order to teach the school effectively, the overseer must prepare diligently each week, making a thorough study of the assigned material. This enables him to keep the congregation enthused about the curriculum, to determine if the assigned material is covered accurately, and to highlight the important points that will be included on the written reviews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Following each student talk, the overseer will commend the student and explain why a certain speech quality was good or why it needs improvement. When anyone needs additional tutoring to prepare his school assignments, the overseer or someone designated by him can render personal assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In order to benefit fully from the hard work of the Theocratic Ministry School overseer and any additional counselors who serve under his direction, we should attend the school regularly. We should also fulfill all our assignments and apply the counsel that we receive as well as that given to other students. In this way, we will progressively improve in our ability to present the Kingdom message publicly and from house to house.—Acts 20:20; 1 Tim. 4: 13,15.</span></p></li></ul>

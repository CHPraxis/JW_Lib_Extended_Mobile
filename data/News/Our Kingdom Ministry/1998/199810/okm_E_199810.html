<p><span class="font9">» ‘Just a few months ago, we ..t'ere making plans to attend the J1998 “God’s Way of Life” District </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font9"> and International Conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now they have become memorable </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">milestone</span><span class="font9">s in the theocratic history of the organization. We thoroughly </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">enjoyed</span><span class="font9"> the rich spiritual </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">food</span><span class="font9"> that we received at itfwse outstanding gatherings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">X <sup>2</sup> The i</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">nternatio</span><span class="font9">nal aspect of * this year’s conventions was really thrilling. Whether missionaries and other delegates from foreign lands were present where we attended or not, all of us heard fine experiences in the Friday afternoon part entitled “Service in the Missionary Field.” The daily </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Reports</span><span class="font9"> on Progress of the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Harvest Work&quot; </span><span class="font9">from a</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">round the worl</span><span class="font9">d were most encouraging.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> A missionary couple in Africa had this to say about our magazines: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">helps us to keep spiritually alert in our territory. We derive encouragement and strength from each issue.” Do you have the same deep appreciation for our journals? And are you as eager to read them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> It takes considerable time to prepare magazine articles that can be read in only a few minutes. Knowing this, will you just skim the articles, look at the pictures, or occasionally read an article that happens to catch your eye? We are wise if we do more than that. We should take time to read and analyze all the articles in every issue of our magazines. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is our principal journal for timely spiritual food. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> carries interesting and informative articles on a variety of subjects. What we learn by reading these magazines not only strengthens us spiritually but also prepares us for a more effective share in the ministry. Being faithful readers ourselves, we will be enthusiastic about offering the magazines to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Improve Reading Habits: </span><span class="font9">Could you do better in keeping up with your reading of the magazines? Here are two suggestions that work for many. (1) Establish a regular reading schedule. Just by setting aside 10 or 15 minutes each day to read, you will be amazed at how much you can read in a week’s time. (2) Have a system to keep track of what you have read. Perhaps you can put a check mark at the beginning of each article you read. Without this, you could miss reading some articles or even a whole magazine. It is important to create a reading routine that works for you and to stick to it.—Compare Philippians 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> “The faithful and discreet slave” has wisely responded to changing times by publishing articles that come to grips with the real needs of people. (Matt. 24:45) Truly, the magazines have touched our lives. The rate of our spiritual progress is, to a large extent, governed by the quality of our theocratic reading habits. A rich spiritual blessing is in store for those who make time to read all the magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During 1999 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SOURCE MATERIAL: The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi!2], The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> [w], </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> [g], </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font9"> (1990 Edition) [si], </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness</span><span class="font9"> [/y], and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> Volume 2 [i(-2] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1:15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.”</span><span class="font9"> When based on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture”</span><span class="font9"> book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font9"> of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">keep within the time limit.</span><span class="font9"> If they are given private counsel, appropriate notations should be made on their speech counsel slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ivhy</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font9"> the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font9"> the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font9"> Volume 2. (See Assignment No. 4 for information on how to develop the material based on a Bible character.) The setting may be an informal witness, a return visit, a home Bible study, or some other feature of field service. In some cases, it may include a parent sharing information with a minor child. The participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student helps the householder or child to reason on the material and understand how the scriptures are applied. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. The student may determine whether to have the householder read certain paragraphs when considering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font9"> book. Not the setting but the effective use of the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. When this assignment is based on information dealing with a Bible character, it will be assigned to a brother or a sister. When it is based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness </span><span class="font9">book, it will be assigned to a brother. For each assignment a theme is set forth in the schedule. When this assignment is based on a Bible character, information can be found in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures, </span><span class="font9">Volume 2, under his name. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme for this presentation and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of considering a Bible character is to show what can be learned from his example. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts as well as undesirable traits stand as strong warnings to turn Christians away from an improper course. When assigned to a brother, this talk should be given with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">•SUPPLEMENTAL BIBLE-READING SCHEDULE: This is set forth in brackets after the song number for each week. By following this schedule, reading about ten pages a week, the entire Bible can be read in three years.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Overseers Taking the Lead —The Secretary</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">'The congregation secretary plays a vital role in ensuring that “all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40) As a member of the Congregation Service Committee, he cares for the congregation’s communications and important records. Although his duties may not be as visible to everyone as those of other elders, his services are greatly needed and appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When correspondence is received from the Society or others, the secretary attends to it and sees that a response is made when needed. He makes certain that the letters that are received are circulated among the elders and then files them for reference. He checks magazine and literature order forms and sends them to the Society. He directly oversees those handling accounts and subscriptions as well as all convention-related matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Since the secretary must send the congregation’s monthly field service report to the Society by'the sixth of the month, it is imperative that all of us report our field activity promptly at the end of each month. He then posts the service reports on the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards. Any publisher may ask to see his personal record of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When a publisher moves in or out of the congregation, the secretary requests from or sends to the elders of the other congregation a letter of introduction along with the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards for that one. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Our Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> pp. 104-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’The secretary reviews the activity of the pioneers, keeping the elders, and especially the service overseer, apprised of any problems that the pioneers might be experiencing. He alerts the Congregation Book Study conductors to publishers who are irregular in field service. Both the secretary and the service overseer take the lead in coordinating efforts to care for inactive ones.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> November 1987, p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Having a better appreciation of the secretary’s duties, may we do what we can to help make his stewardship easier for him to fulfill.—1 Cor. 4:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Song 133 in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sing Praises to Jehovah</span><span class="font9"> is enti- of your seed falls on soil that is fine/May often tied “Sowing Kingdom Seed.” It is based on depend much on you.” How can we increase Jesus’ illustration that likens the disciple- the effectiveness of our ministry? One way is making work to the sowing of seed. (Matt. 13: by establishing and maintaining a magazine 4-8,19-23) The song’s lyrics read: “How much route.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Several objectives can be achieved through a magazine route. (1) Regular visits every two weeks enable you to build a friendly relationship with the interested person. (2) You keep that one regularly supplied with the lifesaving information contained in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> (3) Through your conversations you may help the person to form a longing for Scriptural truth, which can lead to a Bible study.—1 Pet. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Start a Magazine Route: </span><span class="font9">Whenever someone shows interest in the magazines, explain that outstanding articles appear in every issue and that you will be pleased to deliver them every two weeks. After leaving, make a note of the person’s name and address, the date of the call, the dates of the issues placed, the article featured, and the subjects that especially interested the person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> You can start a route with only a few people on it. Then work to build it up by adding others with whom you place magazines. As your route grows, you can organize it geographically so that it will be easier to cover. Keep a careful record of which issues have been placed on each call and when. Add notes about your conversations and about how to continue developing the person’s interest in the truth on the next visit. r </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Include Business and Professional People: </span><span class="font9">Experience has shown that storekeepers and other professionals are likely to accept our magazines on a regular basis. One elder even had the mayor of his town on his magazine route. A publisher started a study with the 80-year-old owner of a building-supply company after having taken the magazines to him for ten straight years!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> A pioneer sister entered a store and met a couple who did not receive her very warmly. However, since they accepted the magazines, she decided to add the couple to her magazine route. In time, the sister wanted to stop calling on them because they were so unfriendly and never had much to say, even when she asked a viewpoint question. But the sister prayed about the matter and eventually placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font9"> book with the couple. After reading it, the wife exclaimed: “At last, I have found the truth!” A Bible study was started, and later the couple got baptized. The pioneer’s perseverance indeed bore good fruitage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Making the Return Visits: </span><span class="font9">When you receive a new magazine, read every article. Look for points that will appeal to each person on your route. Then when you return, you can say: “As I read this article, I thought of you and how it might interest you.” Publishers of all ages can enjoy having a magazine route. Even a young child can say: “I’m glad to see you again. Your latest copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">have arrived. I think that you will like this article entitled...”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Stir anticipation for upcoming articles by drawing attention to the box entitled “In Our Next Issue.” When articles appear as a series, point this out and encourage the reader not to miss any portion of it. Do not forget that each time you deliver the magazines to a person who is on your magazine route, a return visit may be counted. And above all, remember that our goal is to develop these calls into home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Visit People on Your Route on a Regular Basis: </span><span class="font9">You can cover your magazine route at any time that is practical—on a weekday morning, in the late afternoon, in the early evening, or on the weekend after spending time in the house-to-house work. If you are unable to cover your route because of being sick or away on vacation, ask another publisher in your family or congregation to deliver the magazines for you. In that way, the ones on your route will not fail to get their magazines on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> One way to sow Kingdom seed is to take </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> regularly to all of those on your magazine route. As you teach them Scriptural truth, they may get the sense of the word of the Kingdom and eventually bear Kingdom fruit along with you.—Matt. 13:8, 23.</span></p></li></ul>

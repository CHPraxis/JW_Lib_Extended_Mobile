</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Young boys and girls, are you familiar with Jehovah’s command that you be included in the activities of the congregation? (Deut. 31:12; Ps. 127:3) It is a joy to have you beside us as we worship Jehovah together! You warm our hearts when you sit quietly at the meetings and listen closely. It makes us especially happy when you try to comment in your own words. The entire congregation is delighted when you present assigned parts on the Theocratic Ministry School, when you eagerly join us in the field service, and when we hear that you boldly witness to your schoolmates and teachers. —Ps. 148:12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> We want you to know that we take pride in you when we see your good manners, your neat appearance, your clean conduct, and your respect for adults. Our joy is especially great when you show that you are ‘remembering your Grand Creator’ by setting theocratic goals for yourselves. —Eccl. 12:1; Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Tell Us Your Goals: </span><span class="font14">One eight-year-old boy told a district overseer: ‘First I would like to be baptized, then I would like to help in the congregation by serving with the sound and handling microphones, being an attendant, helping with the literature, reading at book studies and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> Studies. Then I would like to be a ministerial servant, then an elder. I would also like to be a pioneer and go to pioneer school. Then I would like to go to Bethel, be a circuit overseer or a district overseer.’ What fine appreciation he showed for the privilege of serving God!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> As you progress physically and spiritually, we rejoice to see you reach your goals. (Compare Luke 2:52.) Each year, thousands of you become unbaptized publishers and then qualify for baptism as dedicated servants of Jehovah. Our joy grows when we next see you reach out to auxiliary pioneer and even enter the full-time service. Truly, children, you are our joy and a wonderful source of praise to our heavenly Father. May Jehovah richly bless you!—Prov. 23:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Will We Do It Again? Another Call for Auxiliary Pioneers</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Will we do what again? Will we auxiliary pioneer during the Memorial season? The February 1997 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> Insert captured our attention with the bold heading: “Wanted—100,000 Auxiliary Pioneers.&quot; We were confident you would take that call seriously. When the March 1997 service report was compiled, we were delighted to learn that 116,335 had enrolled in the auxiliary pioneer service! If we add to that number the 70,472 regular pioneers and the 181 special pioneers who reported that month, we find that nearly 20 percent of all publishers were in the pioneer service. Will we do it again this Memorial season?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> We warmly commend all who put forth the extra effort to increase their field service activity last spring. Clearly, all of you were motivated by unselfish love for Jehovah God and for your neighbor. (Luke 10: 27; 2 Pet. 1:5-8) Publishers in varied circumstances of life made room for auxiliary pioneering. In one congregation, 51 publishers pioneered together the same month, including most of the elders, a mother with a 15-month-old daughter, a sister who quit her job and found part-time work to enable her to pioneer, and an older sister who had never before pioneered. The circuit overseer wrote: “A tremendous effort in the preaching work is under way. . . . Not only is this having an impact on the territory but the congregations are bubbling with enthusiasm. Brothers are enjoying getting to know one another better as well as seeing fine results in the ministry.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Young people were not left out last spring. A 13-year-old unbaptized publisher had been anticipating the time when she could symbolize her dedication to Jehovah. After being baptized in February, she wrote about her desire to auxiliary pioneer in March: “With nothing to hold me back now, I immediately turned in my application.... The many wonderful experiences we enjoyed would never have become a reality had it not been for your loving invitation to pioneer. I am grateful to Jehovah to have had this privilege to be among those 100,000 who responded.&quot; She has set a goal to do it again.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Auxiliary Pioneer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font14">“Whatever your personal circumstances, if you are baptized, are of good moral standing, can arrange to meet the requirement of spending 60 hours a month in the field ministry and believe you could serve one or more months as an auxiliary pioneer, the congregation elders will be pleased to consider your application for this privilege of service.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font14"> page 114.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■* Perhaps you were among the 116,335 who engaged in the auxiliary pioneer activity last March, or the 78,640 in April, or the 56,905 in May. Will you do it again this year? If you were not able to pioneer last spring, can you do it this year? Could we exceed 120,979, the number of those who auxiliary pioneered in April 1989? That was the largest number of auxiliary pioneers in any one month in the United States branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Concentrate on April and May: </span><span class="font14">This year, the Memorial falls on Saturday, April 11, making April an excellent month for increased activity in the ministry. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) During the first 11 days of the month, we will give attention to inviting as many interested ones as possible to attend the Memorial. If you plan to auxiliary pioneer, please submit your application well in advance of the date you wish to start.—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Since May has five full weekends, publishers who attend school or who work secularly full-time may find it easier to auxiliary pioneer that month. By scheduling ten hours in field service each of the five weekends, you would need to schedule only ten additional hours in the month to reach the required 60 hours.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> During both April and May, we will be presenting individual copies of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> as the literature offer. This should encourage even more of us to reach out and pioneer. Why do we say that? The magazines are easy to present and are enjoyable to work with in the ministry. They lend themselves for use in all features of the service—house-to-house and store-to-store work, as well as when we approach people on the street, in parking lots, and in parks and other informal settings. Most important, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> champion Kingdom truths. They draw attention to the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, proving that God’s Kingdom is ruling. They also touch readers’ lives by coming to grips with the real needs of people. If we think of how our life has been touched by these precious journals, we will be motivated to share in giving them the widest possible distribution in April and May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> In preparation for this intensified magazine activity, you will benefit from reviewing these articles: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font14">—Timely Journals of Truth” (January 1, 1994, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower),</span><span class="font14"> “Make the Best Use of Our Magazines” (September 1995 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry),</span><span class="font14"> and “Prepare Your Own Magazine Presentation” (October 1996 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Elders Take the Lead: </span><span class="font14">To accommodate the many publishers who were pioneering last spring, the elders in one congregation promoted one Saturday in the month as a special day of service activity for the entire congre<sup>4</sup>-gation. Arrangements were made to meet at a number of different times during the day, giving all in the congregation an opportunity to share in various forms of witnessing. These included working businesses, witnessing on the street, calling from house to house, making return visits, writing letters, and witnessing by telephone. The response was outstanding, with 117 publishers participating in field service during the course of the day. They totaled 521 hours spent in the ministry and 617 placements of magazines, brochures, and books! The excitement of that Saturday was carried through to Sunday, with a near-record attendance at the Public Meeting and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> Study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> At each Service Meeting in April and May, the congregation should be reminded of when and where meetings for field service will be held during the coming week, especially if some additional arrangements are made other than those normally scheduled. Regular pioneers as well as publishers who are not auxiliary pioneers are encouraged to support these group arrangements as their circumstances permit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> The service overseer will need to meet with the brother who assigns the territories to make arrangements for working the ones that are not covered frequently. Increased attention may be given to not-at-homes and witnessing on the streets and from store to store. Evening witnessing can be emphasized, especially where there is a return to daylight saving time the first weekend in April. Sufficient supplies of magazines should be ordered for both April and May in anticipation of the increased activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Many Publishers Can Qualify: </span><span class="font14">The first sentence on the auxiliary pioneer application states: “Because of my love for Jehovah and my desire to help others to learn about him and his loving purposes, I would like to increase my share in the field service by enrolling as an auxiliary pioneer.” Loving Jehovah and wanting to help others spiritually are basic to our dedication. (1 Tim. 4:8,10) To qualify for auxiliary pioneering, one must be baptized, be of good moral standing, and be in a position to devote 60 hours to the ministry during the month. As all of us consider our circumstances, could some of us who have never pioneered before do so this year in April or May?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> Many in the congregations may realize that they also could pioneer when they see others enroll who have circumstances similar to theirs. Schoolchildren, elderly ones, fulltime secular workers, including elders and ministerial servants, and others have successfully auxiliary pioneered. A housewife and mother of two who has a full-time job reached 60 hours, placed 108 magazines, and started 3 Bible studies in one month of auxiliary pioneering. How did she do it? She used her lunch hour at work to witness in nearby territory, she witnessed by writing letters, and she engaged in parking-lot and street witnessing. She also used her day off from work each week to good advantage by sharing with the congregation in field service. Although she initially thought that auxiliary pioneering was an unreachable goal, with encouragement from others and a practical schedule, the obstacles were overcome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>14</sup> Jesus assured his disciples: “My yoke is kindly and my load is light.” (Matt. 11:30) That was the title of an encouraging article in the August 15, 1995, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> It tells about a sister who had a high-pressure, full-time secular job. Did she think auxiliary pioneering was out of the question for her? No. In fact, she managed to auxiliary pioneer every month. Why? Because she felt that pioneering actually helped her to keep her balance. Aiding people as they learned Bible truth and seeing them change their lives to gain God’s approval was the greatest source of joy in her busy life.—Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> Any personal sacrifices and adjustments that someone needs to make in order to pioneer are more than made up for by the blessings enjoyed. A sister wrote of her experience with auxiliary pioneering: “It helped me to take my mind off self and to be more focused on helping others.... I recommend it for those who can do it.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> It Takes a Good Schedule: </span><span class="font14">On the last page of this insert, we have reproduced the sample schedules that appeared in the February 1997 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font14"> Perhaps'one of these fits your circumstances. As you review them, give thought to your normal routine of monthly activity. What projects around the home can be performed in advance of your pioneering or can temporarily be set aside until afterward? Can some of the time you spend on entertainment, recreation, or other forms of leisure be eliminated? Rather than look at the total of 60 hours that are needed, plan your schedule on a daily or weekly basis. Only 2 hours a day or 15 hours a week are needed to auxiliary pioneer. Look at the sample schedules, and with pencil in hand, see what you can work out in the way of a personal service schedule that best suits you and your family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>17</sup> The fine response and extra support the congregation showed for the ministry last spring bolstered the enthusiasm of a regular pioneer who wrote: “Thank you so much for your loving encouragement to put forth an extra effort to support auxiliary pioneering. ... Your suggested schedules helped many that had never pioneered before to see that they could do it.... I am so happy to be part of Jehovah’s organization and to follow the happy loving lead of the faithful and discreet slave.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>18</sup> Proverbs 21:5 assures us: “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” Proverbs 16:3 encourages us: “Roll your works upon Jehovah himself and your plans will be firmly established.” Yes, by prayerfully including Jehovah in our decision and strongly relying on him to help us succeed, we can be positive about our plans to auxiliary pioneer. It may be that after seeing how well our schedule works for a month or two of auxiliary pioneering, we will be able to mark the box on the auxiliary pioneer application that reads: “Check here if you wish to serve continuously as auxiliary pioneer until further notice.” In any case, we can look ahead to auxiliary pioneering again in August, when there will be five full weekends. As we conclude the service year in August, a concerted effort will be made for everyone to participate as fully as possible in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>19</sup> Jesus prophesied: “He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these.” (John 14:12) It is our joyous privilege to serve as God’s fellow workers when this prophecy is having its grand fulfillment. Now is the time to preach the good news with the greatest intensity ever, buying out the opportune time to do this work. (1 Cor. 3:9; Col. 4:5) Sharing as often as possible in the auxiliary pioneer service is an excellent way to do our part as Kingdom proclaimers. We eagerly wait to see how great the song of praise will be this Memorial season from the auxiliary pioneers. (Ps. 27:6) Thinking of last spring’s results, we wonder, ‘Will we do it again?’ We are confident that we will!</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Question box</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">■ Why should we give special attention to our dress and grooming when visiting the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, and branch offices throughout the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Christians are expected to maintain proper decorum. At all times our dress and grooming should reflect the decency and dignity that befit servants of Jehovah God. This is especially true when visiting the Society’s facilities in New York and at branches around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During 1998, district and international conventions will be held. Thousands of our brothers from many lands will visit the Society’s headquarters in New York as well as branches in other countries. Not only when visiting these facilities but at any other time as well, we need to ‘recommend ourselves as God’s ministers in every way,’ including our appropriate dress and grooming. —2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In discussing the importance of proper dress and grooming, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry</span><span class="font14"> comments on the need for physical cleanness, modest dress, and good grooming when we engage in the field ministry and attend Christian meetings. Then, on page 131, paragraph 2, it states: &quot;The same would apply when visiting the Bethel home at Brooklyn or any of the Society’s branch offices. Remember, the name Bethel means ‘House of God,’ so our dress, grooming and conduct should be similar to what is expected of us when attending meetings for worship at the Kingdom Hall.” This same high standard should be observed by Kingdom publishers from the local area as well as those from more distant places who come to see and associate with members of the Bethel family and to visit the branch facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Our clothing should have a positive influence on others as to how they view the true worship of Jehovah. However, it has been noted that when visiting the Society’s facilities, some brothers and sisters tend to be extremely casual in their dress. Such dress is not appropriate when visiting any of the Bethel homes. In this matter, as in all other aspects of our Christian life, we desire to maintain the same high standards that distinguish God’s people from the world by our doing all things for God’s glory. (Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 10:31) It is also good to speak with our Bible students and others who may be visiting Bethel for the first time and remind them of the importance of giving attention to proper dress and grooming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So when visiting the Society’s facilities, ask yourself: ‘Is my dress and grooming modest?’ (Compare Micah 6:8.) ‘Does it reflect well on the God that I worship? Would others be distracted or offended by my appearance? Am I setting the proper example for others who may be visiting for the first time?’ May we always, by our dress and grooming, “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Though man has searched for ways to slow down the aging process and extend his life span, old age and death are still inevitable. How thankful we are that the Bible explains </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font14"> humans grow old and die, as well as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font14"> the ravages of old age will be reversed and death will be eliminated. These truths are convincingly presented in the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font14"> The book clearly answers perplexing questions about life and death, directing the reader to the time when Paradise will be restored.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In March we will offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book with the goal of starting home Bible studies. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Then we will make return visits on all those who manifest interest in the Kingdom message. In this way we may instill in others the hope of everlasting life. (Titus 1:2) To accomplish this, you may find the following suggestions helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When making the initial call, you might ask this question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “Have you ever wondered why humans yearn for a longer life? [Allow for response.] Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and others all have hope of a life after death.” Open the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book to chapter 6, “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and read paragraph 3. Reason on the cited scriptures. Referring to the two questions at the end of the paragraph, ask the householder if he would like to see the answers for himself. If he is desirous of that, continue discussing the next few paragraphs. A study is being started! Otherwise, leave the book for him to read, and make plans to return, preferably within a day or two, to discuss the answers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When following up a placement of the “Knowledge” book, you could say: </span><span class="font14">■ “I’ve returned to consider the two questions about death that we left unanswered.” Remind the householder of the questions. Then discuss the information in chapter 6 under the subheading “A Sinister Plot.” Depending on the circumstances, either continue the study or use the last question at the end of paragraph 7 to lay the groundwork for the next session. Make definite plans to return. Give the householder a handbill, and briefly describe how congregation meetings are held. Warmly invite him to attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup>Zn </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">either door-to-door work or informal ivitness-ing, you might initiate a conversation by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ “Have you ever wondered what the future holds for us and for the earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible sums up the future in one word—Paradise! It explains that in the beginning, God made a portion of the earth into a beautiful paradise where he put the human couple whom he had created. They were to populate the whole earth, gradually transforming it into a paradise. Notice this description of what it must have been like.” Open the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book to page 8, and read paragraph 9, under the subheading “Life in Paradise.” Then discuss the points in paragraph 10, and read the cited scripture, Isaiah 55:10, 11. Offer to continue the discussion of what life in the restored Paradise will be like and to cover paragraphs 11-16 together. Or encourage the person to read it on his own, and arrange to meet again and discuss it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If a study was not established initially, you could try to do so on the return visit by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “As we discussed in our last conversation, it is God’s purpose that the entire earth be transformed into a paradise. That raises the question, What will Paradise be like?” Open the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book to chapter 1, and study paragraphs Ilie, under the subheading “Life in the Restored Paradise.” Afterward show the illustration on pages 4-5, and ask the person if he would like to live in such beautiful surroundings. Then read the first sentence of paragraph 17 on page 10. Depending on the circumstances, either continue the study or say that on your next visit you will explain what is required in order for someone to live in the restored Paradise. Leave a handbill, explain the meeting schedule, and warmly invite the person to attend at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book is an excellent tool to use in revealing to others “the everlasting life” promised by God. Your conducting home Bible studies with people can instill in them this grand hope that is inspired by the God “who cannot lie.”</span></p></li></ul>

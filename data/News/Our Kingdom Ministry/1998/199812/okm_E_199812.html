<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Last year, over 300,000 new ones joined us by getting baptized. What have these people seen in Jehovah’s Witnesses that causes them to want to be part of God’s organization? Why do we stand out as different from all other religions? Here are some obvious answers: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We stick to the Bible rather than personal opinions:</span><span class="font9"> We worship Jehovah God “with spirit and truth,” just as Jesus Christ said to do. This has meant rejecting religious falsehoods and complying with God’s written Word.—John 4: 23, 24; 2 Tim. 3:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We go to people rather than wait for them to come to us: </span><span class="font9">We have accepted Christ’s commission to preach and to teach, and we imitate his example of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">searching out honesthearted ones. We look for them at their homes, on the street, or wherever they may be found.—Matt. 9:35; 10:11; 28:19, 20; Acts 10:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We provide Bible instruction for everyone without charge:</span><span class="font9"> We freely expend our resources and energy, devoting over a billion hours each year to God’s service. Impartially, we study the Bible with all kinds of people. —Matt. 10:8; Acts 10:34, 35; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We are well trained to help people spiritually:</span><span class="font9"> By means of our personal study of the Bible and the instruction provided at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions, we receive a priceless, ongoing theocratic education, which enables</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We take the truth seriously, applying it in our daily lives: </span><span class="font9">Because of our love for God, we make changes, bringing our lives into harmony with his will. Our Christlike new personality attracts others to the truth.—Col. 3:9,10; Jas. 1:22, 25; 1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—We endeavor to live and work with others in peace:</span><span class="font9"> Cultivating godly qualities helps us to guard our actions and speech. We “seek peace and pursue it” with all persons.—1 Pet. 3:10, 11; Eph. 4:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The examples of Christian living that people see in Jehovah’s organization motivate many to accept the truth. May our personal example have the same effect upon those who know and observe us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jesus likened his hearers to two kinds of builders. One built his way of life on the rockmass of obedience to Christ and was able to withstand the storms of opposition and tribulation. The other built on the sand of selfish disobedience and was unable to stand when pressure came. (Matt. 7:24-27) Living in this conclusion of the system of things, we experience many storms of adversity. On the horizon the dark clouds of the great tribulation are gathering rapidly. Will we endure to the end with our faith intact? (Matt. 24:3,13, 21) Much depends on how we are building our lives now. Thus, it is urgent to ask ourselves, ‘Am I solidly building my Christian life around obedient service to God?’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What does it mean to build our lives around Jehovah’s service? It means making Jehovah the very center of our lives. It involves focusing on the Kingdom as our main concern. It entails obeying God in all the activities of our daily lives. It requires pouring our heart into our personal, family, and congregational study of the Bible and into our field ministry, making these our priorities. (Eccl. 12:13; Matt. 6:33) Such an obedient course results in a rock-solid faith, which will not collapse in the face of any storms of adversity that may strike.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> It is a pleasure to see millions of people confidently building their lives and their hopes for the future around service to God, even a§ Jesus did. (John 4:34) They adhere to a consistent schedule of theocratic activities and enjoy rich blessings as a result. One mother explained how she and her husband successfully reared their two sons to serve Jehovah: “We filled our lives with the truth—going to all the conventions, preparing for and attending the meetings, and making field service a regular part of our lives.” Her husband added: “The truth is not part of our life, it </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font9"> our life. Everything else revolves around it.” Have you likewise set Jehovah’s service as the top priority in your family?</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">“The truth is not part of our lite, it/sour life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everything else revolves around it.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Devise a Workable Weekly Schedule: </span><span class="font9">Jehovah’S organization helps us to follow a good spiritual routine by arranging five meetings a week. Christians who are building their lives around the worship of Jehovah arrange their secular and family affairs in such a way as to attend all these vital meetings. They do not allow matters of lesser importance to interfere with their regular attendance.—Phil. 1:10; Heb. 10:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Mature Christians recognize that just as it is important to have regular meals at certain times each day, so it is vital to make a definite schedule for personal and family study, including preparation for the meetings. (Matt. 4:4) Could you set aside at least a 15- or 20-minute period each day for personal study? The key is not to let other things encroach on the time set aside for study. Make it a useful habit. This may require rising earlier each morning than you do now. The 17,000 members of the worldwide Bethel family rise early in the morning to have a discussion of the day’s text. Of course, rising early requires going to bed at a reasonable hour at night in order to begin the next day fit and rested.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> If you are a family head, take the initiative to plan and organize your family’s schedule of theocratic activity. Some families read the Bible, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, or</span><span class="font9"> another publication together as they relax after the evening meal. Many parents who have seen their children grow up to be spiritually strong Christians say that one factor contributing to their success was the family tradition of setting aside an evening each week during which they enjoyed a spiritual good time together. One such father said: “I feel that the spiritual development of our children was due in large part to our regular Wednesday night family study, begun some 30 years ago.” All three of his children were baptized at an early age, and later all three entered the full-time ministry. In addition to the family study, field service presentations or parts on the meeting can be rehearsed and other wholesome activities can be enjoyed together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> In your weekly schedule, have you ‘bought out time’ for Kingdom preaching? (Col. 4:5) Most of us lead busy lives, having family and congregational responsibilities to care for. If we do not make definite arrangements to share in the preaching and teaching work each week, it will be very easy for other things to crowd out this vital activity. The owner of a large cattle ranch said: “Around 1944 I realized that the only way I would get in service was to schedule a certain day for it. To this day I still take oft a day during the week for service.” One Christian elder finds that having a definite schedule for witnessing enables him to average 15 hours a month in the preaching activity. If he has any secular business on Saturday, he schedules it after his morning field service. Can you and your family schedule at least one day every week for field service, making this part of your spiritual way of life? —Phil. 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Scrutinize Your Routine of Lifo:There are </span><span class="font9">things that work against building our lives around Jehovah’s service. Unforeseen circumstances may disturb our carefully planned schedule of study, meetings, and service. And our Adversary, Satan, will do all he can to “cut across our path” and thwart our plans. (1 Thess. 2:18; Eph. 6:12, 13) Do not permit these obstacles to discourage you, so that you give up. Make whatever adjustments are needed to carry out your scheduled theocratic activity. Determination and persistence are necessary to accomplish what is really worthwhile.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> We must not allow worldly influences and the downward pull of our imperfect flesh to introduce nonspiritual activities that could begin to consume more and more of our time and attention. Self-scrutiny is needed, using such questions as: ‘Has my life course gradually become unbalanced or out of focus, as it were? Have I begun to build my life around things in this world that are passing away? (1 John 2:15-17) How much time do I spend on personal pursuits, pleasure travel, sports activities, or other entertainment—including watching television or surfing the Internet— as compared with time spent on spiritual activities?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> If you sense that your life has become cluttered with more and more unessential activities, what is to be done? Just as Paul prayed that his brothers would be “readjusted,” or “brought into proper alignment,” why not supplicate Jehovah for help to become centered once again on his service? (2 Cor. 13:9, 11, ftn.) Then be determined to live up to your resolve and make the needed adjustments. (1 Cor. 9:26, 27) Jehovah will help you to avoid turning to the right or to the left of obedient service to him.—Compare Isaiah 30:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Stay Busy in God's Joyful Service: </span><span class="font9">Millions desperately pursue happiness only to discover that as the end of life nears, the material things they eagerly sought after have not brought them lasting happiness. It has been “a striving after wind.” (Eccl. 2:11) On the other hand, when we keep our lives centered on Jehovah, ‘placing him in front of us constantly,’ we experience deep satisfaction. (Ps. 16:8, 11) This is so because Jehovah is the very reason for our existence. (Rev. 4:11) Without him, the Grand Purposer, life has no meaning. Serving Jehovah fills our lives with worthwhile, purposeful activity that benefits us as well as others in a lasting way, yes, in an everlasting way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> It is important not to become complacent and lose our sense of urgency regarding the fast-approaching end of Satan’s world. Our day-to-day living is influenced by our view of the future. The people in Noah’s day, who did not believe that there would be a global deluge, “took no note,” centering their daily lives on personal pursuits—eating, drinking, and marrying—until the flood “swept them all away.” (Matt. 24:37-39) Today, those who center their lives on this world will see their prospects for the future disintegrate before them in the greatest destruction that man has ever experienced, “the day of Jehovah.”—2 Pet. 3:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> Keep on, then, building your life around the living God, Jehovah, and the doing of his will. There is no investment that you could make in this life that has such a trustworthy Backer as Jehovah. He cannot lie—he will be true to his promises. (Titus 1:2) He cannot die —nothing laid up with Jehovah is lost. (Hab. 1:12; 2 Tim. 1:12) The life of obedience and faith that we are building now is only the beginning of a life that will last eternally in the joyful service of our happy God!—1 Tim. 1:11; 6:19.</span></p></li></ul>

Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as &quot;Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make announcement to the congre gation after the next accounts report is read.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">■ The Memorial for the year 2000 will be on Wednesday. April 19, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. An exception will be made if there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ A brochure entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Guidance of God—Our Way to Paradise</span><span class="font8"> is being prepared for release shortly. This brochure is designed to appeal to expatriate Muslims who live in an environment where they may feel free to study the Bible. The brochure is being made available in more than 20 languages. At this time you may submit requests for the English edition only. Other language editions will be announced as they become available. ■ With five fUU weekends, the month of January is a good time for many to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit From the 1999 Theocratic Ministry School Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was the Master Teacher. People were “astounded at his way of teaching.” (Mark 1:22) Although none of us can' speak and teach as well as Jesus did, we can endeavor to imitate him. (Acts 4:13) To that end, our participation in the Theocratic Ministry School program will help us to keep on improving our speaking and teaching skills.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In 1999, Assignment No. 1 will be based mainly on articles from the 1997 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines. Our understanding of spiritual matters will be greatly enhanced if we read this information in advance and then hear it on the school program. Those assigned to give these instruction talks should make practical application of the material, presenting it in an interesting and lively manner. Assignment No. 3 will be based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font9"> book, and Assignment No. 4, on a Bible character, although the source material may alternate for these assignments. The school overseer should give careful consideration to the material before assigning the parts. All students assigned to deliver material from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font9"> book should be exemplary in their own family life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Apply Counsel, and Prepare Well: </span><span class="font9">Everyone can make further improvement in the art of speaking and teaching. (1 Tim. 4:13) Hence, we should seek counsel and never view it as something to be avoided. (Prov. 12:15; 19:20) Presenting the truth effectively at the meetings and in the field ministry requires more than just relating facts or reading scriptures in a perfunctory way. We need to reach hearts and motivate those who listen to us. We can do this by speaking the truth convincingly from our heart. (Compare Acts 2: 37.) The counsel we receive in the school will help us to accomplish this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> As soon as you receive an assignment, think about the speech qualities that you are to work on as explained in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook.</span><span class="font9"> Consider what you need to do to apply previous counsel that you received. Meditate on your theme, the setting you wifi use if one is called for, and how you will apply the scriptures found in your assigned material. Ponder over how best to use the information to teach and to motivate.—1 Tim. 4: 15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If you are apprehensive about enrolling in the school, pray about it and then discuss your feelings with the school overseer. Everyone can benefit by taking full advantage of the program that will be presented in the Theocratic Ministry School in 1999.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Offering the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span></h3>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World [Translation] </span><span class="font9">is well worth acquiring. It is lively and lifelike, and makes the reader think and study. It is not the work of Higher Critics, but of scholars who honour God and His Word.” So stated a noted Hebrew and Greek commentator. We agree. How can we help others to have the same appreciation for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> when we offer it along with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book in December?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Some people may respond, “I already have a Bible. I don’t need another one.” Our challenge is to help them see that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> is not just another Bible. It is a literal translation in today’s language that accurately captures the sense of the original text. One aspect of its superiority can be demonstrated by comparing the renderings of such words as “shambles” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(King James Version)</span><span class="font9"> with “meat market” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(New World Translation)</span><span class="font9"> at 1 Corinthians 10:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> However, few people read the Bible, much less understand its principles for everyday life. They need to know that God’s Word can influence their lives for good and that following its counsel on honesty, morality, and family life can help them to cope with today’s problems.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> A Suggested Presentation: </span><span class="font9">“Would you agree that with today’s moral values changing so rapidly and with the uncertainty that exists about our future, we need a reliable guide in life? [Allow for response.] Although it is the oldest of books, the Bible gives practical counsel for modern living and happy family life.” Then turn to chapter 2 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and read paragraph 10 and the first sentence of paragraph 11, including 2 Timothy 3:16,17. If interest is shown, place the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book, explain our free home Bible study program, and offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font9"> If you feel that it would be better to start the study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font9">brochure, you may do so. You will find additional suitable introductions on pages 9-15 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Let us reflect our appreciation for the superb </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font9"> We can do this by zealously offering it in December.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>—The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower Study</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Conductor</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> is the primary provision of “the faithful and discreet slave” for dispensing spiritual food to us “at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45) The elder who conducts the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study has a vital responsibility as a capable teacher who sets a fine example in Christian living.—Rom. 12:7; Jas. 3:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> To teach effectively, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study conductor must put real effort into preparing each week. He does so prayerfully and carefully. His keen interest in the congregation is reflected in a genuine endeavor to reach our hearts with the material being studied. He concentrates on the main points of the lesson and helps us to see how they relate to the theme of the article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Thorough preparation on his part involves looking up the scriptures in advance so as to know how they apply. He keeps God’s Word to the fore by encouraging the congregation to make good use of the Bible during the study. When an important point is' not covered in comments from the congregation or when the application of a key scripture is overlooked, he asks a specific additional question to draw out the information. In this way, he helps us to arrive at correct conclusions and to know how to apply what we learn in our lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study conductor progressively strives to improve his own teaching ability. He does not comment excessively but encourages us to comment—in our own words, briefly, and to the point. He may occasionally remind us that the first one to comment on a paragraph should give a brief, direct answer to the printed question. Additional comments from the audience may draw attention to scripture application, supporting arguments, or practical application of the material. By promoting personal and family preparation, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">Study conductor works to stimulate everyone’s desire to participate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> As “persons taught by Jehovah,” we appreciate “gifts in men,” such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">Study conductors, who “work hard in . . . teaching.”—Isa. 54: 13; Eph. 4:8, 11; 1 Tim. 5:17.</span></p></li></ul>

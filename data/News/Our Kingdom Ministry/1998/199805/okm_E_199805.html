<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">May 1998 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 41, No. 5</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Spirit Is With Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have a tremendous work assignment. Jesus said: “In all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) Viewed from a human standpoint, this would seem impossible, but not so. We have the most powerful force in the universe backing us up—God’s spirit.—Matt. 19:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> First-Century Evidence: </span><span class="font2">Applying Isaiah’s prophecy to himself, Jesus said: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me ... to declare good news.” (Luke 4:17,18) Before ascending to heaven, he told his apostles that they likewise would be empowered by holy spirit to witness “to the most distant part of the earth.” Thereafter, Philip was directed by holy spirit to preach to an Ethiopian court official, the spirit sent Peter to a Roman centurion, and it dispatched Paul and Barnabas to preach to the Gentile nations. Who would have thought that people from such backgrounds would respond to the truth? But they did.—Acts 1:8; 8:29-38; 10:19, 20, 44-48; 13:2-4, 46-48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Modern-Day Evidence: </span><span class="font2">The book of Revelation stresses the involvement of holy spirit in today’s preaching work by stating: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’. . . Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:17) The spirit has motivated Christ’s bride class and their “other sheep” companions to preach the good news to all peoples. (John 10:16) We should be bold in our preaching, never hesitant to approach people of all sorts, ever confident that God’s spirit will help us. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1998 Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> provides convincing proof that God’s spirit continues with his servants. Look at the response! During the past two service years, an average of over 1,000 were baptized each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Rest assured that God’s spirit will continue with us as we preach the Kingdom message to the extent that Jehovah wills. This knowledge should encourage and motivate us to keep exerting ourselves vigorously in the all-important Kingdom work.—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have “a Thorn in the Flesh”?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> We keenly desire to fulfill our commission to preach the good news to the best of our ability. Many of our dear brothers and sisters, however, find it difficult to share fully because serious physical ailments or disabilities interfere, making it hard to do as much as they would like. For them, it may be a challenge to cope with feelings of discouragement, especially when they see others around them so active in the ministry.—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> An Example to Imitate: </span><span class="font2">The apostle Paul had to contend with “a thorn in the flesh.” He three times entreated Jehovah to remove the distressing obstacle, which he described as “an angel of Satan” that kept slapping him. Yet, in spite of it, Paul endured and pressed forward in his ministry. He did not pity himself or become a chronic complainer. He gave his best. The secret to his success in coping was this assurance from God: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.” Paul’s weakness became a strength when he learned to accept his situation and to rely on Jehovah and holy spirit in order to endure.—2 Cor. 12: 7-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How You Can Endure: </span><span class="font2">Does human frailty impose limitations on your service to God? If so, imitate Paul’s outlook. Even if your illness or disability has no permanent remedy in this system of things, you can put your full trust in Jehovah, who understands your needs and will provide “the power beyond what is normal.” (2 Cor. 4:7) Take advantage of the help available to you in the congregation, not isolating yourself. (Prov. 18:1) If you find it difficult to share in the door-to-door work, search out practical ways to do informal or telephone witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Though a thorn in the flesh may restrict what you are able to do in the ministry, you need not feel left out. Like Paul, you too can “bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God,” doing what your strength and circumstances allow. (Acts 20: 24) As you put forth the effort to accomplish your ministry, know that Jehovah is well pleased.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “God’s Way of Life” Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the convention program should be assigned in advance to three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Any comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1998 “God’s Way of Life” </span><span class="font0">District and International Conventions</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Proverbs 10:29 reminds us that “the way of Jehovah is a stronghold.” What an appropriate theme this year’s convention has—“God’s Way of Life”! Just how will this theme be developed throughout the three-day program? All of us look forward with keen anticipation to what is in store. And significant points will be featured.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Missionaries, international servants, or others serving in foreign assignments may be attending your convention. It is expected that there will be thousands of delegates from other lands present in cities where the international gatherings are held. Perhaps you will meet some of these visitors. The convention program will feature reports on how Jehovah is blessing the work in various territories.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> It Is Worth th® Effort to Attend: Many of our brothers in Africa have experienced hardships because of war and turmoil occurring in some parts of that continent. They view the conventions of Jehovah’s people as their lifeline. Some must walk long distances to attend a convention, yet they would not think of missing one. A 73-year-old brother in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) walked some 280 miles to attend a convention. He arrived 16 days after he had started out, feet swollen, but happy to be there. Following the convention, overjoyed and spiritually strengthened, he returned home on foot. This has been his routine for years!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> In Mozambique a district overseer and his wife climbed a high mountain and crossed a large desertlike area on foot to attend a circuit assembly. They made the 55-mile trip in 45 hours. All in attendance were greatly encouraged by the fine example of this couple. Many families present had made similar efforts to attend. The district overseer reported that some brothers, including one who is 60 years old, traveled 130 miles on foot!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Have you made definite plans to attend this year’s convention? It is not likely that you will have to walk long distances, but some effort and sacrifice will be necessary in order for you and your family to be present. Arrange to attend the entire program from beginning to end. Many Bible students are progressing toward dedication. Their attendance at the convention will help them make the right decision. Have you invited your Bible students and other interested ones to attend with you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> A Throe-Day Program: This year the program will be presented at 198 conventions in the contiguous United States. In addition to English, conventions will be held in American Sign Language, Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. The February 15, 1998, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">lists the dates and locations of these conventions. By now you have been informed of the convention to which your congregation is assigned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Special] M©«o: It is particularly important that you attend the convention to which your congregation has been assigned. Please do not plan to attend one of the international conventions unless your congregation has been assigned there. Convention facilities where international conventions are to be held will not accommodate even a portion of all who would </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">like</span><span class="font2"> to attend there. Your individual respect for and cooperation with these arrangements will ensure that everything takes place decently and by arrangement.—1 Cor. 14:33,40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings, the program will begin at 9:30 a.m. On Friday and Saturday, the program will end at 5:00 p.m., and on Sunday, at 4:00 p.m. Doors will open each day at 8:00 a.m. Only those with work assignments will be permitted to enter earlier than that. However, no one will be allowed to save seats until after 8:00 a.m.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> As we travel to and from the convention, we should look for opportunities to do informal witnessing. Gas station attendants, store clerks, toll collectors, hotel personnel, and waiters may be interested in the Kingdom message. Prepare for this by bringing tracts, current magazines, brochures, or other literature with you so that you can take advantage of opportunities to witness to people who may not otherwise be reached with the good news.—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> “Pay Attention to How You Listen”: </span><span class="font2">Convention delegates are wise to heed the advice found at Luke 8:18. All are encouraged to bring a Bible as well as a songbook and a notebook. Listen carefully for key points from each presentation, and make brief notes. Ask yourself how you can make personal application of the material. Each night of the convention, before you go to bed, why not review your notes and analyze how closely you are adhering to Jehovah’s way of life.—Prov. 4:10-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> It has been noticed that during the sessions, some leave the auditorium and sit in their vehicles, thus missing the presentation of the program. Others have been observed walking aimlessly in the corridors when they should be sitting in the auditorium and listening. Groups of young people have been seen leaving the convention site in the midafternoon. Some of Jehovah’s servants in times past made serious errors in their lives because they did not carefully listen to Jehovah’s reminders. Surely we would want to avoid making a similar mistake. (2 Ki. 17:13-15) “The faithful and discreet slave” has prepared instruction that all of us need. It is especially important that we “pay more than the usual attention to the things heard” during each session of the three-day convention program. Something of special interest to us will be featured each day, including information that will surely have a wholesome effect on our way of life in the future. By our being attentive and making full use of what Jehovah provides spiritually at the upcoming convention series, our hope will be firmly anchored, so that “we may never drift away” from God’s way of life. —Matt. 24:45; Heb. 2:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Attire That Honors Jehovah: </span><span class="font2">In these critical times, we need to pay more than the usual attention so that we will not be overtaken by the spirit of this world. (1 Cor. 2:12) Our dress and grooming should be modest and should reflect the dignity of the God whom we worship. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) Expensive clothing is not required in order to be among those who “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God.” (Titus 2:10) Note the excellent practical and Scriptural counsel on pages 17 and 18 of the June 15, 1997, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> paragraphs 14-18. Never underestimate the powerful witness we can give by dressing in a way that honors Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> A 16-year-old Witness related that when she and her brother went to a restaurant one evening after the sessions, they noticed that some of the brothers and sisters who were there had changed into inappropriate attire. However, many patrons of the restaurant reacted favorably upon seeing Witnesses who were neatly and appropriately dressed and wearing their badge cards. This opened the way for giving a witness to some of the patrons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Conduct That Praises Jehovah: </span><span class="font2">We know that our Christian conduct can affect how others view true worship. Therefore, we want to conduct ourselves at all times in a way that is worthy of the good news and that brings praise to Jehovah.—Phil. 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> Last year, a district convention was held for the first time in the north of Angola. On the second day of the convention, two local police officers were sent to the site to ensure that public order was kept. They stayed the whole day. At the end of the day, they expressed their admiration for what they had heard and for the orderly conduct they had observed. One of them commented: “Why were we sent here? We know that Jehovah’s Witnesses keep order at their gatherings.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> A member of a political party in an African country fled to Europe when all other members of his party were murdered. He experienced many personal problems and became very discouraged. Eventually he accepted a Bible study. While attending his first district convention, he was impressed that people from a variety of backgrounds were meeting together in peace and harmony. He was convinced that he had found the truth, and during that convention he decided to break off all his political connections. Later he was baptized, and now he and his children are serving Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> How will our conduct at the conventions this year affect those who may be attending for the first time? Will they notice the spirit of cooperation evident when we work together as volunteers? Will they be impressed by the cleanliness of our surroundings and by seeing that before leaving the site, we and our children pick up any trash that may have accumulated near our seats? Will they observe our fine conduct as we travel to and from our accommodations and the convention site? Will they notice that as parents, we closely supervise our children at all times? Let us ensure that we make the best possible impression on all who observe us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Covering Convention Expenses: </span><span class="font2">An admission ticket for a seat at a sporting event or other performance in a stadium or convention hall can be expensive in today’s secular world. This is partly due to costly rental fees in metropolitan areas. The Society has always had a “seats free, no collections” policy at conventions. How, then, will rental fees and other convention expenses be met? By the generous contributions of those in attendance. We are sure that you will show a spirit of generosity like that manifested by God’s servants in the past in imitation of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. (2 Cor. 8:7) Great care is taken to make sure that all contributions are secured, accounted for, and used for their intended purpose. Any contributions made by check should be made payable to “Watchtower.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>19</sup> Seating: The directions that have been given for a number of years will continue to apply, namely, SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR. It has been good to see fine improvement in this matter, and this has heightened the loving atmosphere displayed at the conventions. At most sites, some seats are more easily accessible than others. Please show consideration, and leave the more convenient seats for the elderly and others whose circumstances require them. Remember that Tove does not look for its own interests.’ —1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> Hearing impaired: </span><span class="font2">You will be pleased to know that provision has been made for those with impaired hearing to receive the program through FM radio broadcast. If you are hearing impaired, you will need a small Walkmantype FM receiver </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with earphones</span><span class="font2"> in order to hear the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Cameras, Camcorders, and Audiocassette Recorders: </span><span class="font2">Cameras and recording equipment may be used at conventions. However, your use of them must not be distracting to others. Walking around taking pictures during the sessions would disturb others who are trying to concentrate on the program. No recording devices of any sort are to be connected to the electrical or sound systems, nor should this equipment block aisles, walkways, or the view of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> First Aid: </span><span class="font2">The First Aid Department is for emergencies only. Please bring your own aspirin, digestive aids, bandages, safety pins, and similar items, as such things will not be dispensed at the convention. Any known to be at risk of seizures, insulin shock, heart problems, and so forth, should bring the necessary medication with them. They should be accompanied by a member of their family or a congregation member who understands their situation and can respond to an emergency, should one arise. Problems have arisen at conventions when individuals with chronic health problems were left alone and became ill. If some with special health needs do not have family members who can assist them, the elders will need to be apprised of the situation and should make necessary arrangements for help. It is not possible to make provisions at the conventions for special rooms to accommodate those who have environmental illnesses or allergies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Food at th© Convention: </span><span class="font2">Each person in attendance should bring his own food rather than leave the facility during the short noon break to purchase something outside. A light snack that is nourishing and easy to transport will likely be sufficient. The May 1995 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font2"> insert, paragraph 26, gives some ideas of what to bring. Glass containers and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in convention facilities. Food coolers or bags must be small enough to fit </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font2"> your seat. Some in the audience have been observed eating and drinking during the program. This shows disrespect for the occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> How glad we are that the 1998 “God’s Way of Life” Convention will be starting soon! Have you completed your plans to attend? May you have a safe journey and return home refreshed, determined to press on in Jehovah’s precious service and to keep pursuing God’s way of life for your eternal blessing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Baptism: </span><span class="font2">Baptismal candidates should be seated in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. Each one who plans to be baptized should bring a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font2"> bathing suit and a towel. In the past some have worn attire that was not appropriate and that detracted from the occasion. Elders reviewing the questions in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font2"> book with baptismal candidates should make sure that each one understands these points. Baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah. Thus, it is inappropriate for candidates to embrace each other or to hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Badge Cards: </span><span class="font2">Please wear the 1998 badge card at all times while in the convention city and when traveling to and from it. This often creates opportunities for us to give a fine witness. Badge cards and holders should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font2"> be available at the convention. Do not wait until a few days before the convention to ask for cards for you and your family. Remember to carry your current Advance Medical Directive/ Release card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Rooming: </span><span class="font2">We are asking for the cooperation of everyone in using ONLY the listing of accommodations provided by the convention. Have in mind that the convention room rates also apply on Thursday and Sunday nights, if YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A HOTEL, please do not hesitate to notify the Rooming Department </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">while you are still at the convention</span><span class="font2"> so that they can assist you in resolving the matter right away. Please realize that it may not be possible for everyone to get a nonsmoking room at a hotel, even if the request was made when the reservation was booked. The same applies to your preference for king-size, queen-size, or double beds. Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms are promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify the landlord or hotel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">□ Baby SSroiflers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font2">In most locations, baby strollers cannot be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit placing them in corridors and aisles or between rows of seats. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, strollers are potentially dangerous, both to the baby and to any who might stumble over them. So please do not bring strollers to the convention site. Infant or child safety seats secured in seats next to the parents are permissible. Please do not bring lawn chairs. Use of them is not allowed at large public facilities. Your cooperation is important and appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font2">Can you set aside some time at the convention to assist in one of the departments? Serving your brothers, if only for a few hours, will be very helpful and brings much personal satisfaction. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working with a parent or another responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">n Words off Caution: Be sure your vehicle is locked </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at all times,</span><span class="font2"> and never leave anything visible to tempt someone to break in. Thieves and pickpockets focus their attention on large gatherings. It is not wise to leave valuables at your seat. You cannot be sure that everyone around you is a Christian. Why offer any temptation? Reports have been received of attempts made by some outsiders to lure children away. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Television and video services available in many hotels often feature pornographic programs. Do not permit children to have unsupervised access to the television in the room. Parents may wish to prevent their children from activating “pay TV” in their room by requesting the hotel to lock out this feature during their stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please do not phone or write the management of the convention auditorium, seeking information about any convention matters. If the information is not available from the elders, you may write to the address of a specific convention, as found on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">■ With a letter addressed to all congregations in the United States dated February 20, 1997, the Society’s Legal Department provided revised health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) forms to each congregation. The congregation secretary should therefore make sure that the master copies of DPA forms on file with his congregation are dated 1/97. If these revised forms are not in the congregation file, the secretary should contact the Society’s Legal Department. Unused copies of the old DPA forms should be discarded.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Is it not true that we are more likely to reach our worthwhile goals when we plan how best to use the time available to us? Summertime affords us a variety of opportunities to advance theocratic interests. (Prov. 21:5) What are some of these?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The “God’s Way of Life” Convention is one event that all of us should include in our plans. Arrange time off from work or school so that you will be present for each day of the convention. Make reservations for your accommodations and arrangements for your travel well in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Why not plan to increase your field service activity during the summertime? Longer daylight hours and warmer weather may allow you to spend more time in the preaching work. School vacation gives young people the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer during one or more summer months. Others too can plan ahead to auxiliary pioneer in August, when there will be five full weekends. This August, as we conclude the service year, a concerted effort will be made for everyone to share as fully as possible in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Do you plan to assist a nearby congregation that needs help in covering its territory? The circuit overseer can inform the elders about the needs in your area. Or, if you qualify and would like to apply to the Society to cover seldom-worked or unassigned territory, obtain an application from your elders. If you will be vacationing away from home, plan to attend the meetings and share in the field service with the congregation in that locality. If you visit relatives who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, prepare beforehand ways that you might share the truth with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> What are your plans for the summer? No doubt you want to refresh yourself physically. But do not overlook the more important opportunities that exist to energize yourself spiritually by continuing to put the Kingdom first in your life. —Matt. 6:33; Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Select Articles for Targeting Special Interests of the People</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Like archers who take careful aim with their arrows, many congregation publishers and pioneers are enjoying excellent success using selected articles from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower and Awake! </span><span class="font2">to appeal to the specific interests of the people in their territory. They determine who most likely would want to read certain articles from the magazines. How do they do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> First they read each issue from cover to cover. Then they ask themselves, What type of person would each article appeal to? Effort is then made to visit individuals who would likely be interested in reading that article. When anticipating that a particular issue should receive wide acceptance in their territory, they order an extra supply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Our Magazines Are </span><span class="font2">Well </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Respected: </span><span class="font2">One of our subscribers who works for Nigeria’s most widely read international magazine said about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!:</span><span class="font2"> “Congratulations on the world’s best general interest magazine.” An avid reader of our magazines observed: “What wonderful gems of priceless wisdom! There is hardly a subject that interests me that I do not find discussed somewhere in the pages of one of these [journals].”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The magazines cover a wide range of subjects, including the Bible, world events, family concerns, social problems, history, science, animal and plant life, to list just a few. Certainly a person is more inclined to read something when it relates to his needs, circumstances, or profession. Since we speak to many individuals, each with their own particular preferences and problems, selecting articles specifically to appeal to the people we meet is very effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Notice what happened when two Witnesses offered the September 8, 1996, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> to a newspaper columnist. He wrote: “Before I got a chance to say that I was not interested, one of them added: ‘There is an article on American Indians. We know that you have been writing a lot about the subject.’ ” He took the magazine and, during breakfast, read the material about Indians, later admitting that “it was excellent” and “honest to the core.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> What Interests People in Your Territory? </span><span class="font2">What have you seen in the magazines in recent months that may appeal to storekeepers and professional people in your territory or to your neighbors, workmates, and classmates? What would be of particular interest to attorneys, educators, family and school counselors, youth advisers, social services providers, and health practitioners? Keeping the people you preach to in mind as you analyze each issue will give you excellent ways to spread the word of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> When you find a person who shows a special interest in a certain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">article and who accepts the magazine, you might say: “When there is an article in a future issue that I feel would also be of interest to you, I will be happy to bring you a copy.” You may be able to add the person to your magazine route, calling back every so often with the latest magazines. That is similar to what has been done in obtaining an open invitation to make return visits on individuals who may be especially interested in certain articles that appear in our magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Have a Spiritual Objective: </span><span class="font2">A few years ago, a career-oriented man obtained an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazine on a subject that interested him. However, this religious man also read the accompanying issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> which contained an article that prompted him to scrutinize his lifelong belief in the Trinity. Six months later he was baptized! Hence, do not hesitate to engage the readers of our magazines in Scriptural discussions. You could introduce the brochure </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font2"> and offer to take just a few minutes to discuss one lesson each time you return with a new set of magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Give careful thought to who among your return visits and business contacts would most likely appreciate having the current issues of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> Then make an earnest effort to reach them. Contact as many as you can with these valuable journals. And never forget that as you strive to help more people read our magazines, you are ‘sending out your bread upon the surface of the waters.’ In time, you may have success in finding future fellow disciples. —Eccl. 11:1, 6.</span></p></li></ul>

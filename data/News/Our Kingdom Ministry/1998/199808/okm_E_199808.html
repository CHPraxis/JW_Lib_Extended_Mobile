<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">August 1998 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 8/98 Vol. 41, No. 8</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Will August Be a Banner Month?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The year 1963 was a banner year for Jehovah’s people. Do you know why? It was then that the number of publishers worldwide reached the one million mark. If you were in the truth at that time, you may remember how excited we were to have so many preaching the Kingdom message! Now, there are that many publishers in this country alone. However, each month, on the average, 90,000 of us do not report having some share in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Accept the Challenge: </span><span class="font9">During August we are endeavoring to reach an all-time peak of one million publishers in the United States. If our efforts are successful, August will be a banner month indeed! We can do this if all of us do our part.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Those planning vacations can spend some time in the ministry before going. Take tracts, brochures, or magazines with you so that you can give a witness to people you meet along the way. Also, at your destination you can enjoy sharing in the ministry with the local publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> If you are incapacitated, you can still have a share in the ministry. You may be able to witness to doctors, nurses, or visitors. Perhaps you can witness by letter or by telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Some undoubtedly will appreciate assistance so as to share in the field service in August. Elders, ministerial servants, and study conductors should arrange for this help to be provided. By all means, do not forget to turn in your field service report promptly at the end of the month so that you will be counted as a publisher in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Cherish the Privilege: </span><span class="font9">The ministry is a “fine trust.” (2 Tim. 1:14) We appreciate the privilege we have been given to preach the good news. (1 Thess. 2:4) When we consider everything that Jehovah has done for us, we should be moved to have a continuous share in this all-important work the whole year long. Nothing should be allowed to hinder us from preaching regularly. Let us make this August a banner month in Jehovah’s service and resolve to witness about him every month thereafter!—Ps. 34:1.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths—Take Advantage of Your Schooling</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">‘How do you feel about returning to school after the summer break? Are you eager to benefit from another year of schooling? Will you take advantage of the opportunities that school affords you to share the truth with your classmates and teachers? We are confident that you want to do your best in school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be a Good Student: </span><span class="font9">If you are well prepared when you attend your classes and pay close attention, you will derive lasting benefits. Be diligent about caring for your homework assignments, but do not allow ytTur schoolwork to interfere with theocratic activities.—Phil. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Start out the new school year by reading the brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education.</span><span class="font9"> Then, you or your parents should give a copy to each one of your teachers. Let them know that any questions they may have will be answered. This will help them understand your principles and beliefs better and work with you as you apply what you have been taught. It will also assure your teachers that you and your parents wish to cooperate with them as they help you acquire a valuable education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be a Good Witness: </span><span class="font9">Why not view school as your personal territory for informal witnessing? During the coming school year, you will have unique opportunities to witness. You possess wonderful spiritual knowledge that when shared, can “save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4: 16) By maintaining exemplary Christian conduct and by witnessing whenever it is appropriate to do so, you will benefit both yourself and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> One young brother witnessed informally to fellow students in his school. Among those who responded favorably were a Catholic, an atheist who used to mock those who believe in God, and a youth who was a chain-smoker and a heavy drinker. In all, this young brother helped 15 of his peers to dedication and baptism!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> So youths, apply yourselves to learning and to working your unique witnessing territory. Then you will enjoy the greatest benefit from going to school.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A Progressive Look at the Urgent Work of Making Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">‘Before leaving the earth, Jesus commanded his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations.” This required that they undertake an intensive preaching and teaching campaign and extend their activity into all the inhabited earth. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 1:8) Did they view this commission as a burden too difficult to bear? Not according to the apostle John. After spending 65 years as a disciple maker, he wrote: “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.”—1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Scriptural r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecord</span><span class="font10"> of the a</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ctivit</span><span class="font10">y of the early Christians proves that they urgently worked at their commission to make disciple:TofJesus Christ. (2 Tim. 4:1, 2) They did this, not simply out of duty, but because of their loving desire to praise God and to bring the hope of salvation to others. (Acts 13:47-49) Because all who became disciples were thereafter disciple makers themselves, the Christian congregation grew rapidly in the first century.—Acts 5:14; 6:7; 16:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Disciple-Making Work Speeds Up: </span><span class="font10">The greatest disciple-making work of all time is being accomplished in this 20th century! Thus far, millions of people have accepted the good news and acted on it. (Luke 8:15) Since time is fast running out for the present system of things, “the faithful and discreet slave” has provided us with the tools that make it possible for people of honest heart to learn the truth quickly. —Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In 1995 we received the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font10"> and in 1996 it was followed by the brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font10"> Regarding the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, the January 15,1996, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 14, stated: “This 192-page book can be studied in a comparatively short time, and those ‘rightly disposed for everlasting life’ should be able to learn enough through a study of it to make a dedication to Jehovah and get baptized.”—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The June 1996 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">insert, “How to Make Disciples With the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> Book,” gave us this goal: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Depending on the circumstances and aptitude of the student,</span><span class="font10"> it may be possible for you to cover most chapters in one session of an hour or so, without rushing through the study. Students will make better progress when both teacher and student keep their appointment for the study each week.” The article went on to say: “It should be expected that by the time a person completes a study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, his sincerity and depth of interest in serving God will have become apparent.” The Question Box in the October 1996 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">explained: “It is expected that within a relatively short period of time, an effective teacher will be able to assist a sincere average student to acquire sufficient knowledge to make an intelligent decision to serve Jehovah.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book Gets Results: </span><span class="font10">On the occasion of a young woman’s baptism, she related how she felt about studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. For a while she had been studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book. When the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book was released, the sister conducting her study switched to the new book. Soon, the student could see that this was going to require a decision on her part, and she was motivated to make rapid progress from that point on. The young woman, now our sister, says: “The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book helped me to love Jehovah, but the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book helped me to make the decision to serve him.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Consider how quickly another woman learned the truth. After her second study, she attended a meeting at the Kingdom Hall during the visit of the circuit overseer. That week, at her third study, she told him that she had made her dedication to Jehovah and wanted to become an unbaptized publisher. She met with the elders, who approved her as a publisher, and the next week she started in field service. She became so involved in her Bible study that she took a leave of absence from her job in order to study two or three times a week and spend more time in the ministry. On occasion, they would cover two or three chapters per session. She began applying what she was learning in all areas of her life, finished the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font10">book in four weeks, and progressed to baptism!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> The husband of a sister describes himself as having been “a typical unbelieving mate.” One day, a brother offered him a Bible study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book on the condition that the man could quit after the first study or at any time thereafter. The husband agreed to give it a try, despite being a poor student in his younger days and not having studied religious literature of any kind for over 20 years. What was his reaction to studying the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font10">book? He said: “It was a real pleasure to find that this Bible aid was written with such simplicity. The information was presented so clearly and logically that before long, I was looking forward to our next study with great expectation. My teacher skillfully followed the disciple-making methods outlined by the Society, and with the help of Jehovah’s spirit, I was baptized four months later. I can truly say that if we develop a love for making disciples, continue searching for those righthearted ones in the field ministry, make use of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book and other Bible aids as supplied by the Society and, most important, pray for Jehovah’s direction, we can have the very special privilege of helping to make disciples.” The above are truly exceptional experiences. Most of our students do not come into the truth this quickly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Students Progress at Different Speeds: </span><span class="font10">It must be acknowledged that the abilities of both teachers and students of God’s Word can vary considerably. Spiritual growth can be slow or fast. Some students make in a few months the progress that may take others much longer to realize. A person’s rate of spiritual growth is affected by his educational background, by the degree of his appreciation for spiritual things, and by the depth of his devotion to Jehovah. Not everyone we study with has “the greatest eagerness of mind” to study the Scriptures daily, as did the ancient Beroeans who became believers.—Acts 17:11, 12.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> That is why the April 1998 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> insert, “Wanted—More Bible Studies,” gives this realistic direction: “Of course, not all Bible students progress at the same rate. Some are not as spiritually inclined as others nor as quick to absorb the things being taught. Others lead very busy lives and may not be able to devote the time needed to cover a full chapter each week. Thus, in some cases it may be necessary to take more than one study session to cover certain chapters and some additional months to complete the book.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Disciple Makers Keep a Balanced View: </span><span class="font10">It is necessary to gauge the pace of the study according to the circumstances and aptitude of the student. Since we are being encouraged to start studies in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure, it may take from two to three months to cover it before getting into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. If we utilize all the suggestions that were outlined in the June 1996 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> insert, it could very well take another six to nine months to finish the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. Some who just started a study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book switched over to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure to help the student to learn basic Bible truths more quickly. Then the study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book was resumed. If a study is started in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book and progresses well, it may be advantageous to study the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure after completing the book, thus quickly reviewing the basic truths of God’s Word. In either case, we do not want to sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding for the sake of speed. Every student needs a solid basis for his newfound faith in God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> In view of where we are in the stream of time, it is more urgent than ever before to help others learn the truth. Besides continually praying to start new Bible studies, let us pray for those who are already studying with us. Then it will be our joy to keep baptizing more disciples “all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”—Matt. 28:20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">The provision of special assembly days began in 1987. These one-day gatherings have proved to be upbuilding for Jehovah’s servants and for interested ones who attend. Beginning in September 1998, a new special assembly day program will be presented. You will find the nine talks and numerous interviews and experiences to be spiritually beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Show Appreciation for Jehovah’s Table” is the theme of the new program. (Isa. 65: 14; 1 Cor. 10:21) It will strengthen our resolve that our worship of Jehovah must take foremost place in 'our lives. (Ps. 27:4) The circuit overseer’s part will deal with “Examining the Inclinations of Our Hearts” toward meeting attendance. A guest speaker will show us how to “Maintain Spirituality by Feeding at Jehovah’s Table.” Practical encouragement will also be given to young people in Jehovah’s organization to maintain steadfastness in serving God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The visiting speaker’s main discourse, entitled “Spiritually Fortified to Give a Bold Witness,” will show how the provisions made through the congregation equip us to witness boldly about the Kingdom. Who would not want to benefit from this program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Newly dedicated ones who wish to be baptized should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. We are confident that as we begin the 12th year of the special assembly day arrangement, everyone attending will be spiritually uplifted for the work ahead.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Overseers Taking the Lead—The Presiding Overseer</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> To serve as an overseer in the congregation is a serious responsibility. (Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 3:1) This is the first of a series of articles that will outline the various duties of Christian elders so that all of us can appreciate the important work they do in our behalf.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The Society appoints the presiding overseer to serve for an indefinite period of time. As the presiding overseer coordinates matters, this helps elders to give proper attention to their assigned duties. (Our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry, p.</span><span class="font9"> 42) What does this entail?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’The presiding overseer receives congregation mail and promptly passes it along to the secretary for handling. In preparing for elders’ meetings, the presiding overseer obtains suggestions from the elders on matters needing discussion and compiles the agenda. He also serves as chairman at elders’ meetings. When decisions are made, he sees to it that there is appropriate follow-through. He oversees the preparation of the Service Meeting and the scheduling of public talks. He approves all announcements that are made to the congregation, authorizes payment of all normal operating expenses, and ensures that the quarterly audit of the congregation accounts is performed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> As chairman, the presiding overseer coordinates the work of the Congregation Service Committee. When a Bible student asks to be recognized as an unbaptized publisher or when an unbaptized publisher wants to get baptized, the presiding overseer arranges for elders to meet with him. The presiding overseer also takes the lead in preparing for the circuit overseer’s visit so that the congregation can benefit to the full from the special week of activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The duties of the presiding overseer are many and varied. As he humbly cares for his responsibilities “in real earnest,” all of us can do our part by cooperating with the elders. (Rom. 12:8) If we are “obedient” and “submissive” to those taking the lead among us, they can perform their work with a greater degree of real joy.—Heb. 13:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Gives Power Beyond What Is Normal</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> A precious privilege of sacred service—the Christian ministry—has been entrusted to all of Jesus’ disciples. (Matt. 24:14; 28: 19, 20) But human imperfection and the pressures of this system of things may at times cause us to view ourselves as being quite inadequate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> When this happens we can be comforted by the apostle Paul’s letter to anointed Christians in Corinth. He wrote: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels.” (2 Cor. 4:7) Paul was confident: “Since we have this ministry.... we do not give up.” (2 Cor. 4:1) True, it is a challenge for every one of us, whether anointed or of the “other sheep,” to keep on declaring the good news and “not give up.” We need strength from God, who supplies “the power beyond what is normal.”—John 10:16; 2 Cor. 4:7b.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Encouragingly, many Witnesses are zealous evangeliz-ers despite having to contend with bitter opposition, serious health problems, or limited finances. All of us must realize that our assignment to preach has Jehovah’s backing. Rather than let discouragement or apprehension weaken our resolve to preach, let us “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength.” —Eph. 6:10; Prov. 24:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How to Acquire God’s Power: </span><span class="font11">Persevere in prayer, asking for God’s help and strength. (Rom. 12:12; Phil. 4:6, 7) Then, with all your heart, trust in Jehovah to provide power beyond what is normal. (Prov. 3:5) Read the modern-day life stories in our magazines, for they give evidence that Jehovah is helping his servants today to endure trials. Keep close to the brothers in the congregation, and do not forsake the congregation meetings.—Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> May we do all that we can to put ourselves in line to receive Jehovah’s power—a power that is beyond what is normal and that will help us not give up in the all-important work of Kingdom preaching.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Respect for Jehovah’s Place of Worship</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we are guests in someone’s house, we show respect for that person’s property, not doing anything to damage it, and we do not disrupt the orderly routine of the household. How much more should this be true when we are Jehovah’s guests! We ought to know how to conduct ourselves in his household. (Ps. 15:1; 1 Tim. 3:15) Whether our Christian meeting is held in the Kingdom Hall, a private home, or a public facility, the vast majority of us always show respect for our place of worship as if it were the house of Jehovah, whose “dignity is above earth and heaven.”—Ps. 148:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Some brothers show a lack of respect at the meetings by being noisy or acting as if the information presented were unimportant. A few adults carry on needless conversations in the foyer, lobby, rest room, or outside of the Kingdom Hall while the meeting is in progress. When an older child is left to supervise a younger one, sometimes the two begin playing and derive little benefit from the program. Some youths have been seen outside the Kingdom Hall after meetings, playing, being excessively noisy, even making karatelike movements toward one another. In some cases they have disturbed the neighbors or interfered with traffic in the parking lot or street.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Avoid Being Disrespectful: </span><span class="font11">Appreciating the dignity and sacredness of our worship, undoubtedly we would not want to distract others by whispering, eating, chewing gum, rustling papers, making unnecessary trips to the rest room, or habitually arriving late for meetings. Respectful and appreciative parents do not allow their children to soil the carpet, upholstery, or walls of the Kingdom Hall or the home where the book study is held. And doubtless all of us agree that there certainly is no place for any kind of shameful conduct, foolish talking, or obscene jesting at our meetings.—Eph. 5:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If we always remember the purpose of our Christian meetings, we will make sure that we and our children show due respect for Jehovah’s worship in the place where we “have chosen to stand.”—Ps. 84:10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1998 “God’s Way of Life” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Year after year Jehovah’s modern-day worshipers throughout the earth eagerly anticipate gathering in large numbers at district conventions. In this, they reflect the spirit of Jehovah’s faithful servants in ancient Israel who joyfully sang the words of Psalm 122 while en route to worship Jehovah at Jerusalem. Verse 1 of that psalm reads: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.”’ On such occasions we also see increasing evidence that the inspired words of Isaiah 2:2, 3 are being fulfilled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This year we have special reason to rejoice in view of the international flavor that will be added by thousands of delegates from countries around the earth attending some of the larger conventions. Missionaries returning to visit family and friends will be at many of the conventions. Therefore, the convention program at each location will feature field experiences and reports on the progress of the Kingdom-preaching work in other lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Of course, only invited congregations in the general area of the international conventions will be able to attend those gatherings. It is vital for everyone to respect these limitations in order for all conventions to be held in an orderly manner. The international flavor will be evident at all district conventions in some program parts and reports, as well as by the presence of missionaries who may be attending.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As preparations continue for our 1998 “God’s Way of Life” District Convention, we would like to review some information you will need in order to obtain hotel rooms for the convention. Your full cooperation will show your personal appreciation for all the arrangements made in your behalf.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Making a Hotel Reservation: </span><span class="font12">When this insert is considered at the Service Meeting, your district convention assignment letter will be read to the congregation. The Recommended Lodging List for your convention will be posted on the congregation information board after the meeting that night. No reservation calls to ANY hotels, by the elders or anyone else, are to be made until after the Service Meeting when the district convention assignment letter is read. Hotels available for the upcoming convention have been placed on the first Recommended Lodging List. Only if these hotels are filled will new hotels be added and a revised list be sent to your congregation. If at all possible, make your reservation during January from the first Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If the hotel you have selected is full, call another until you have a reservation. If you have called all the hotels on the list and no rooms are available, inform your congregation secretary. He will contact the Rooming Department at the telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. Hotels will</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Making Your Hotel Reservation</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Call hotel during regular business hours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Ask reservation clerk for a confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Make your deposit. Write the confirmation number on your check or money order. Do NOT send cash.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. If you pay by check or money order, contact hotel in two weeks to verify that your deposit has been received. </span><span class="font12">be added, and a revised list will be mailed to your congregation. Please wait for the new list rather than make your reservation from hotels not on the list. Because of fire and safety regulations, you should arrange for no more than four persons in each room. If the hotel will allow more than four persons to a room, this will be indicated on the Recommended Lodging List. When you make a reservation, always ask for a confirmation number from the hotel.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Sending Deposits to Hotels: </span><span class="font12">The only way to guarantee a room reservation is if your deposit is received by the hotel. Without a deposit, the hotel has the right to give your room to someone else. For each room reserved, a one-night deposit must be made within ten days of making your reservation. Your deposit may be by credit card, check, or money order. Please do not send cash. If you send a check or a money order, write your confirmation number on the front of it and contact the hotel about two weeks later to confirm that your deposit was received. If you provide a credit card number for your deposit, you should tell the reservation clerk that you want the deposit to be charged to your credit card immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Changing Hotel Reservations or Making Reservations at More Than One Hotel: </span><span class="font12">Before the convention the Rooming Department calls each hotel on the list to find out how many rooms have been reserved by our delegates. Because of the large number of brothers and sisters needing rooms, we are asking that, once you make a reservation, please keep that reservation. Do not switch your reservation to another hotel, even if one that is closer or more desirable appears on a subsequent list. That hotel has been added because there are brothers and sisters who still need rooms. It was not added to provide upgrades for those who already have rooms reserved. Also, please reserve only the hotel rooms you will actually use during the convention. Do not reserve rooms for other delegates unless they have personally requested that you make their reservation. Double booking rooms is not fair and creates more work for the Rooming Department and the hotels.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> If you experience a problem with a hotel </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">during</span><span class="font12"> the convention, please bring this to the attention of the local Rooming Department at the convention. For any difficulties experienced </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">before or after</span><span class="font12"> the convention, you can contact the Rooming Department, using the address and telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Using Only Those Hotels on the Society’s Recommended Lodging List: </span><span class="font12">The Society is making an effort to arrange conventions in locations that are more convenient for our brothers and sisters. Although the convenience of our convention locations permits many brothers to commute to and from the convention site, hotel accommodations remain a necessity. Last year, 1,095 hotels were used at the 194 conventions held in 66 different cities. For 1998, the Society is attempting to obtain blocks of rooms at hotels closer to each convention site. Each year, we appeal to the brothers to make reservations only at hotels on the Society’s Recommended Lodging List. What is accomplished by heeding this direction?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup> Saves money for our brothers and sisters:</span><span class="font12"> When hotels cooperate with the Society’s arrangement, room rates are lower for our brothers. Instead of our resources going to the hotels, they can be put to better use supporting the families of our brothers and sisters and the worldwide work. Even if we personally can afford more expensive accommodations, we should support the efforts of the Rooming Department by using only hotels from the Recommended Lodging List. This spirit of concern for others is described at 1 John 3:17 and is the principle behind 1 Corinthians 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup> Demonstrates obedience to the Society’s directions:</span><span class="font12"> This point should be one of our main concerns. Hebrews 13:17 says: “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account; that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you.” Our cooperation in this matter is requested only two or three days each year. Even if our personal choice is different, our good example, as seen by our brothers, promotes a loving, united, and supportive spirit.—See 1 Corinthians 16: 16; Philippians 2:1-4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font12">The elderly, the infirm, those in full-time service, or others may require assistance in attending the convention. Relatives, the elders, and others in the congregation who are aware of the unique circumstances of those with special needs can lovingly make the necessary arrangements, not shifting the responsibility of family and congregation to the convention organization.—Compare 1 Timothy 5:4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> For those who cannot be cared for in this way, the Society’s Special Needs Room Request form outlines the qualifications for submitting a Special Needs form. This provision is only for publishers in good standing, including those with well-behaved children, who have been approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Before filling out a Special Needs Room Request form, carefully read the information at the bottom of the fqrm. These requests should be sent to the Rooming Department as soon as possible.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> Conclusion: </span><span class="font12">Comments from hotel personnel show that you brothers and sisters are to be commended for demonstrating godly qualities. The managers at one hotel said Jehovah’s Witnesses are “the nicest and best behaved group that we host.” Another said: “I felt I needed to say thank you on behalf of the hotel staff. Your delegates are to be praised as one of the most pleasant, congenial, and courteous groups we have had the pleasure of serving. It is a true reflection of your organization’s values and sincere respect for humankind. We look forward to hosting you again.” While making her room reservation for last year’s convention, a sister was told the following by the</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Program Times</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. - &nbsp;&nbsp;5:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sunday</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:30 a.m. - &nbsp;&nbsp;4:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">reservation clerk: “I can immediately tell when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses is on the phone. You are always so polite, warm, and conversational. This Baptist is always impressed, and you are all to be commended.” Comments like these are good to hear, are they not? The conduct of the brothers and sisters that prompted these comments surely makes Jehovah’s heart glad.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> The Society receives many letters from brothers and sisters expressing their appreciation for the arrangements made for them. A family from Illinois said: “We just want you to know that we did not take the district convention for granted. We realize it did not happen by chance but was the result of much hard work on the part of many brothers. We wrote to thank you.” A sister from Michigan wrote: “I want to express heartfelt thanks to all my brothers involved with the rooming arrangements. My husband and I appreciate the reduced rates, as we are subsisting on one income so that I may continue pioneering. These arrangements help us benefit so much more from the convention.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> It is clear to all of us that Jehovah is supporting the arrangement of annual conventions. Since many of the brothers traveling to district conventions require rooms, we can be assured that Jehovah will adequately provide for these needs as well. Proving that we are “faithful in what is least” puts us in line for receiving the grand blessings that await those whom Jehovah loves.—Luke 16:10.</span></p>

Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font10"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly Interested people And It Inconvenient to attend. Nor should the schedule be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for interested ones, or enjoy a general interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Good Use of Handbills</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Congregation handbills are useful for informing people in the community of the Kingdom Hall address and the correct time of the meetings. It would be good to leave one with every person you contact. To that end, each congregation should keep an ample supply of handbills in stock. For congregations that change meeting times annually, in January, new handbills should be ordered during the preceding October each year so that a supply with current meeting times will always be on hand. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Handbill Request</span><span class="font11"> form is to be used for this purpose. Once you have them, how can handbills be used to best advantage?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers find that handing one to a person is an effective way to introduce themselves and start conversations. Pointing out the meeting schedule or the message on the reverse side can open the way to a discussion about our work and its purpose. Parepts can involve their young children in the ministry by having them offer a handbill at the door. Publishers who share in letter-writing witnessing should enclose a handbill in their letter and invite the person to attend the meetings. It may be that handbills can be left at not-at-homes, provided that care is taken to put them under the door so that they are completely out of sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Handbills have been instrumental in directing honest-hearted ones to the truth. One experience tells of a woman who, thanks to a handbill, was able to fulfill her lifelong desire to understand the Bible. After she had spent a night in prayer to God, a Witness couple rang her doorbell in the morning. Looking through the peephole, she called out that she could not open the door. The Witnesses pushed a handbill under the door. It read: “Know Your Bible.” She saw it and opened the door. A study was started immediately, and she was later baptized. Never underestimating the power of God’s spirit, may we regularly make good use of handbills as we fully accomplish our ministry.—See also February 1994 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> page 1.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Take Delight in Giving a Thorough Witness</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> All of us enjoy doing the things we do well. Mark 7:37 says that the multitudes declared regarding Jesus: “He has done all things well.” No wonder that Jesus took delight in doing Jehovah’s will! (Compare Psalm 40:8.) By giving thought to the following suggestions, we likewise will And joy as we obey Jesus' order “to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness.” (Acts 10:42) In January we are offering any 192-page book published prior to 1985 that the congregation may have in stock or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book. How may we use these publications to give a thorough witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since people are often concerned about health issues, yoti might say this: </span><span class="font11">■ “Despite significant accomplishments made in the field of medicine, there is much suffering because of Illness. In your opinion, why is this? [Allow for response.] Jesus Christ said that pestilence would be a feature of the last days. (Luke 21: 11) Yet the Bible also describes a time when sickness will be no more. [Read Isaiah 33:24.] Notice how this handbook inspires hope in that basic Bible teaching.” Highlight appropriate comments in the book that you are featuring, and offer it. Explain that we.will accept a modest donation toward our worldwide ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When witnessing informally near shopping areas, you could offer a greeting and then ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Does it seem to you that things are getting so expensive these days that it is difficult to make ends meet? [Allow for response.] Do you think a time will ever come when there will be true economic security?” Allow for response. Then feature an appropriate Scripture quotation from the book you are offering. Continue by saying: “This book shows how, by means of his Kingdom, God will solve the problems that make life so difficult today.” Offer the book, and if it is accepted, give the person an opportunity to support the worldwide work with a small voluntary donation. You might state how much you enjoyed the conversation and then ask: “Is there any way we can continue this conversation at another time?” In this way you may be able to obtain the person’s telephone number or home address.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You may have opportunity to try this presentation about world peace, using the “Live Forever” book:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Why, in your opinion, is world peace so hard to attain? [Allow for response, then show illustration on pages 20-1.] This is a picture of a Bible event described in Revelation. [Read Revelation 12:7-9, 12 directly from paragraph 17. Then read the caption that goes with the picture.] The world’s lack of peace is one of the effects of the Devil’s being cast down to the earth. This book answers many important questions, and I am happy to make it available to you if you will read it.&quot;—To find other effective ways of presenting the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book, see the back page of the September 1995, February 1995, September 1994, September 1993, and August 1992 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> When returning to see those who show interest, you could endeavor to start a Bible study by adapting this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “The last time we spoke, you made a very interesting observation. [Mention a comment the individual made.] I have been thinking about that, and I would like to share the results of some research I did on the subject. [Share an appropriate scripture.] We offer to conduct a free study course that has enabled millions of people to explore the basic teachings of the Bible in a short period of time. Such an examination can build your confidence in the certain fulfillment of God’s promises.” Highlight some questions that will be answered. If the person declines the offer of a Bible study, explain that we also have a special accelerated course that only takes 15 minutes a week for 16 weeks. Show the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure, turn to lesson 1, and ask if you may demonstrate the first lesson.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Remember to Use Handbills: </span><span class="font11">They could be used effectively in your introduction to stimulate interest in spiritual matters, or they may be left if no literature is accepted. Where there is interest, use the printed message on the back of the handbill to encourage the person to accept a home Bible study and to come to our meetings.</span></p></li>

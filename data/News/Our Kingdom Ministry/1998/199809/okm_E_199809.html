<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">September 1998 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 9/98 Vol. 41, No. 9</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We Can Do Greater Works</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Outstanding works characterized the ministry of Jesus Christ. He miraculously fed thousands, cured many, and resurrected some from the dead. (Matt. 8:1-17; 14:14-21; John 11:38-44) His activity captured the attention of an entire nation. Yet, the last evening before his death, he told his faithful followers: “He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these.” (John 14:12) How can we do “greater” works?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Covering More Territory: </span><span class="font12">Jesus’ sphere of activity was limited to Palestine, whereas his early disciples were told to witness “to the most distant part of the earth,” far beyond where Jesus himself preached. (Acts 1:8) The preaching work that he began is now global, covering 232 lands. (Matt. 24:14) Are you having a full share in working the territory assigned to your congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Reaching More People: </span><span class="font12">Jesus left behind relatively few disciples to continue the preaching work. However, as a result of their zealous witnessing at Pentecost 33 C.E., those who embraced the truth and were baptized that day amounted to some three thousand souls. (Acts 2:1-11,37-41) The ingathering of those “rightly disposed for everlasting life” has continued to our time, when we are baptizing an average of over 1,000 a day. (Acts 13:48) Are you doing all you can to reach hon-esthearted people wherever they may be found and to follow up on the interest as soon as possible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> By Preaching Far Longer: </span><span class="font12">Jesus’ earthly ministry was limited to three and a half years. Most of us have been preaching longer than that. Regardless of how long we will be allowed to continue this work, we are grateful to help each new disciple get started on the road leading to life. (Matt. 7:14) Are you having plenty to do every month in the work of the Lord?—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We can remain confident that with Jesus backing us, we will do still greater works as his true disciples.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Get to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Know</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Your Brothers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Bible describes a true friend as a person who sticks closer than a brother, who is constant in his love and loyalty, and who comes to the aid of his companion during distress. (Prov. 17:17; 18:24) We will have no shortage of such friends in the congregation if we put forth the effort to get to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">know </span><span class="font12">and to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font12"> one another.—John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Fine opportunities to get acquainted with our brothers are afforded before and after the meetings. Why not arrive early and linger afterward so that you can enjoy warm and lively fellowship? Seek out a variety of brothers to converse with, including older experienced ones and younger or timid ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Initiate Conversations: </span><span class="font12">Go beyond saying just a passing greeting to your brothers. You can initiate a conversation by sharing an experience in the field ministry, a point of interest in a recent magazine, or a comment about the meeting just concluded. You can learn much about your brothers by being a good listener, encouraging them to talk about their experiences and things they are learning. Just asking how one came to know Jehovah may reveal much. Some have been through faithstrengthening experiences in their lives, while others are enduring situations right now that may be hard for many to imagine. Realizing this will help us, as true friends, to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Befriend One Another: </span><span class="font12">After the death of her child, a sister found it hard to sing Kingdom songs that mention the resurrection. She recalls: “One time, a sister who was sitting across the aisle saw me crying. She came over, put her arm around me, and sang the rest of the song with me. I felt so full of love for the brothers and sisters and so happy that we had got to the meetings, realizing that’s where our help is, there at the Kingdom Hall.” We should befriend our brothers by offering them solace when it is needed and encouragement at all times.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As this old world becomes ever more oppressive, let us resolve to get to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font12"> our brothers better. This interchange of genuine encouragement will prove to be a blessing to all.—Rom. 1: 11, 12.</span></p>

He raises questions based on the article and invites comments from the audience, especially from pioneers and publishers who have been involved in the program. Consider how to get the best results from it. Pioneers may relate how they have enjoyed and benefited from sharing in assisting others. Publishers who have been helped may tell how they appreciate this loving provision and mention points that helped them achieve greater success and Joy in the ministry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Overseers Taking the Lead</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—The Service Overseer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">'The service overseer is keenly interested in everything related to the progress of the evangelizing work in the congregation’s assigned territory. He thus plays a vital role in helping us fulfill our responsibility to preach the good news. As a zealous evan-gelizer, he takes the lead in organizing all service-related matters. As a capable teacher, he helps individual publishers improve their effectiveness in the ministry.—-Eph. 4:11,12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This elder directly oversees the work of the ministerial servants assigned to handle literature, magazines, and territories. He is responsible for making sure that an ample supply of literature, magazines, and service forms are available each month for our use. Once a year he reviews the territory file for all addresses of homes where we have been advised not to call, and he assigns qualified brothers to visit these homes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’The service overseer is responsible for supervising various avenues of preaching, including business, street, and telephone witnessing. He is alert to organize practical arrangements to meet for service throughout the week, including holidays. He shows genuine interest in the Bible study activity. He seeks ways to give spiritual assistance to those who become irregular or inactive in the ministry. He is actively concerned about the work of the pioneers, and he oversees the Pioneers Assist Others program.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As a member of the Congregation Service Committee, the service overseer proposes any needed adjustments in the Congregation Book Study groups. When he visits your group, be sure to be in attendance and to share with him in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> All in the congregation should willingly cooperate with the direction given by the service overseer. This will help us increase our effectiveness in the disciple-making work and find greater joy in our ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Pioneers Assist Others</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said: “The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” Since the first-century harvesters were few in number and they had much territory to cover, Jesus could have directed them to reach as many as possible with the good news by sending them out singly. Instead, he “sent them forth by twos.” (Luke 10:1, 2) Why by twos?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Those disciples were new and inexperienced. By working together they could learn from and encourage one another. As Solomon put it, “two are better than one.” (Eccl. 4:9, 10) Even after holy spirit was poured out at Pentecost 33 C.E., Paul, Barnabas, and others accompanied fellow believers in the ministry. (Acts 15:35) What a privilege it must have been for some to be trained personally by such capable men!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Fine Training Program: </span><span class="font12">Like its first-century counterpart. the modern Christian congregation is a preaching organization. It also provides us with training. As individuals, our heartfelt desire should be to present the good news as effectively as possible. So that more publishers can improve in their effectiveness, assistance is available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At the Kingdom Ministry School held recently, the Society announced a program for pioneers to assist others in the field ministry. Is there a need for this? Yes, there is. Over one million publishers have been baptized in the past three years, and many of these need training to become more effective in the preaching work. Who can be used to fill that need?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Full-time pioneers can help. Jehovah’s organization provides them with much counsel and training. Pioneers receive instruction tailored to their needs in the two-week Pioneer Service School. They also benefit from meetings with the circuit and district overseers, as well as from guidance by the elders. Although not all pioneers are as experienced as Paul and Barnabas were, they have received valuable training, which they are happy to share.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Who Will Benefit? </span><span class="font12">Is participation in this program restricted to new publishers or to newly baptized ones? By no means! There are younger ones and older ones who have known the truth for years but would appreciate help in certain features of the ministry. Some do excellent work in placing literature but have difficulty in making return visits or in starting Bible studies. Others may start Bible studies with ease but observe that their students do not progress. What is holding them back? Experienced pioneers may be requested to offer help in these areas. Certain pioneers are effective in cultivating interest, starting Bible studies, and directing new students to the organization. Their experience will be helpful in this new program.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Do you find that your schedule does not allow you to support the congregation’s regular meetings for field service as much as you would like? A pioneer may be able to work with you at times when other publishers are not available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Good Cooperation Is Needed: </span><span class="font12">Twice a year, the elders will make arrangements for publishers who are desirous of personal assistance to participate in the Pioneers Assist Others program. If you agree to receive such assistance, get together with the pioneer publisher assigned to help you, work out a practical schedule for service, and stick to it. Keep each appointment. As you work together, observe effective ways of presenting the good news. Analyze why certain approaches are effective. Consider suggestions the pioneer publisher may offer for improving your presentation. As you apply the things learned, your progress in the ministry will become evident, both to you and to others. (See 1 Timothy 4:15.) Work together as often as possible, sharing in all features of the ministry, including informal witnessing but focusing on any particular area in which you need personal assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> The service overseer is interested in the progress that will be made. Periodically, he will check with the Congregation Book Study conductor to see how you are benefiting from the program. The circuit overseer will likewise help you when he visits the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah wants his people to be trained and “equipped for every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:17) View the Pioneers Assist Others arrangement as a fine provision to help those who desire to improve their ability to preach the word. If it is your privilege to share in it, do so with gratitude, humility, and joy.</span></p></li></ul>

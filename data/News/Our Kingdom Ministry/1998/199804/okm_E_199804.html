<p><span class="font3">April 1998</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vol. 41, No. 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> By our ministry we demonstrate our obedience to the two greatest commandments. (Matt. 22:37-39) Our love for Jehovah motivates us to speak positively about him. Our love for our neighbors moves us to encourage them to seek knowledge of God’s will and purposes so that, like us, they can come to love Jehovah and put themselves in line for the prize of everlasting life. So, then, by our ministry we honor Jehovah’s name and share the priceless Kingdom hope with our neighbors. Yes, our ministry is an expression of true love for God and for man.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Our love impels us to speak to all kinds of people in all kinds of settings. (1 Cor. 9:21-23) To illustrate: Aboard an airplane, a Christian elder sat beside a Roman Catholic priest. The elder drew the priest out by asking a few tactful questions and then directed the discussion toward the Kingdom. By the time the priest got off the plane, he had accepted two of our books. What a fine outcome for the elder’s expression of true love for his neighbor!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> True Love Motivates Us to Preach: </span><span class="font9">Those who engage in the auxiliary and full-time pioneer work certainly are expressing true love for God and for neighbor. Pioneers are constantly sacrificing their time and energy to help others spiritually. What motivates them to do this? One pioneer said: “I know that love is a fruit of God’s spirit. So without it, I wouldn’t be in the truth at all, not to mention succeeding as a pioneer. Love makes me people conscious, aware of their needs, and I appreciate that people respond to love.” Jesus demonstrated such love for people. Once when he and his weary disciples were going somewhere to “rest up a bit,” the crowds got there ahead of them. What did Jesus do? “Moved with pity for them,” he set his personal needs aside in order “to teach them many things.”—Mark 6:30-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Even when people reject the good news that we offer, we experience an inner joy, knowing that moved by love, we have done our best to help them gain salvation. When all of us are ultimately judged by Christ, we will be very happy that we demonstrated true love by ‘fully accomplishing our ministry.’—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>
<div><img src="okm_E_199804_files/okm_E_199804-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:289pt;height:24pt;">
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Meeting together has always been vital for Jehovah’s people. The Israelites had the temple and their synagogues as centers for true worship, divine education, and joyful association. Similarly, the early Christians did not forsake gathering together. As pressures and trials increase in these critical last days, we too need the spiritual strengthening that our congregation meetings provide—and we need it “all the more so.” (Heb. 10:25) Note three reasons why we attend meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> For the Association: </span><span class="font9">The Scriptures admonish us to “keep comforting one another and building one another up.” (1 Thess. 5:11) Godly association fills our minds with good thoughts and motivates us to do good works. But if we isolate ourselves, we are apt to entertain foolish, selfish, or even immoral ideas.—Prov. 18:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> For the Instruction: </span><span class="font9">Christian meetings .provide a continual program of Bible instruction designed to keep the love of God alive in our hearts. They give practical direction in applying “all the counsel of God.” (Acts 20:27) Meetings train us in the art of preaching and teaching the good news, skills that are needed all the more so now to experience the unspeakable joy of finding and assisting those who will accept Bible truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> For the Protection: </span><span class="font9">In this wicked world, the congregation is a real spiritual refuge—a haven of peace and love. When we are in attendance at congregation meetings, God’s holy spirit has a powerful influence on us, producing the fruitage of “love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.” (Gal. 5:22, 23) Meetings fortify us to stand firm and solid in the faith. They equip us to be prepared for the trials ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> By regular meeting attendance, we experience what the psalmist described, as recorded at Psalm 133:1, 3: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” Wherever God’s people serve and meet together today, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“there</span><span class="font9"> Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.”</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>

<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> Early in the study, show the student how to prepare in advance by reading the cited scriptures and underlining key words in answer to the printed questions. Concentrate on only the main points. Although we may need to be flexible for the first few sessions, it is important that a Bible study be held on a regular basis. Have in mind how you will introduce prayer as an essential part of the study and how you will Scripturally prepare the student for opposition. By all means, make the study lively!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> Of course, not all Bible students progress at the same rate. Some are not as spiritually inclined as others nor as quick to absorb the things being taught. Others lead very busy lives and may not be able to devote the time needed to cover a full chapter each week. Thus, in some cases it may be necessary to take more than one study session to cover certain chapters and some additional months to complete the book. In some instances we may study the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font9"> brochure first and then progress through the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book.

When all of us do this, the meetings are livelier and more upbuilding. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attend regularly. </span><span class="font9">A high attendance is more encouraging to everyone present, strengthening appreciation for the importance of attending. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrive on time. </span><span class="font9">If seated before the program starts, we can join in the opening song and prayer and thus receive full benefit from the meeting. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Come well equipped. </span><span class="font9">By bringing our Bible and the publicatidn(s) used during the meeting, we can follow along and better grasp what is being discussed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoid distractions. </span><span class="font9">We may listen better when we sit up front. Whispering and trips to the rest room can cause us and others to lose concentration. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a participant. </span><span class="font9">When more of us raise our hands and comment, more are encouraged and built up by the expressions of faith. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Make brief comments. </span><span class="font9">This gives as many as possible an opportunity to share. We should confine our brief comments to the material being studied. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfill assignments. </span><span class="font9">As students in the Theocratic Ministry School or as participants in the Service Meeting, prepare well, rehearse in advance, and try not to cancel. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Commend participants. </span><span class="font9">Tell others how much their efforts are appreciated. This builds them up and motivates them to do even better in the future. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Encourage one another. </span><span class="font9">Kind greetings and upbuilding conversations before and after meetings add to the pleasure and benefits that we derive from attending the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazines Announce the Kingdom</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are well-known for our zealous preaching about God’s Kingdom. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines we distribute play a powerful role in helping millions of people to learn about God’s purposes. The message they contain is indeed good news, for it announces God’s heavenly Kingdom as the only hope for mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The magazines come to grips with the real needs of people—emotional, social, and spiritual. With morals and family values collapsing all around, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> help people improve the quality of their lives by showing them how to apply Bible principles. It will be our pleasure to feature the magazines during April and May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> They Have Real Appeal: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> are available in the languages of virtually all the world’s population. Because of this, our magazines are well-known. Here are some reasons why people are attracted to them:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ As journals of integrity and truth, they clearly show the difference between good and bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ They give hope of a righteous paradise to come, based on God’s promise to bring the earth under his Kingdom rule. ■ A wide variety of timely subjects are presented, appealing to people of all backgrounds and cultures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The articles are concise, educational, factual, and free from prejudice and compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The eye-catching illustrations create immediate interest, and the clear writing style makes the magazines easy to read.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Distribute Them Widely: </span><span class="font9">Effective magazine distribution depends largely upon our diligence in preparing our presentations, scheduling our time, and organizing our preaching activity. Practical suggestions were offered in the September 1995 and October 1996 issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> which would be good to review and apply.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Acquaint Yourself With the Magazines: </span><span class="font9">As you read each issue, think of someone who would appreciate having a copy. Look for specific points or scriptures that you can quote in your presentation. Think of a question you can ask to initiate a conversation and stimulate interest in the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Adapt the Presentation to the Person: </span><span class="font9">Prepare a simple, flexible presentation that can be adjusted for a man, a woman, an older person, or a youth, whether an acquaintance or a stranger.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Be Watchtowvorand </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conscious: </span><span class="font9">Since the magazines easily fit into a bag, a purse, or a pocket, we can carry copies with us when traveling or shopping. Offer them when talking to relatives, neighbors, coworkers, schoolmates, or teachers. Set aside a day each week for magazine witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Show Appreciation for the Magazines: </span><span class="font9">They never lose their value. The passage of time does not lessen the importance of the message that they contain. Of course, if we make a special effort to place all the magazines we obtain, older issues need not accumulate on our shelves.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* Street Witnessing Is Effective: </span><span class="font9">This is one of the best</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font9">ways to offer the magazines to a large number of people. Some publishers work busy thoroughfares at regular intervals on shopping days.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Business Territory Is Productive: </span><span class="font9">When witnessing from store to store, we have few not-at-homes. Most business people are courteous, and many gladly accept the magazines. Feature articles that are appropriate for the particular business being contacted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Magazine Routes Have Potential: </span><span class="font9">Since the magazines are published semimonthly, it is only natural to call back on people who read them and to present the next issues. We should make regular return visits, not only to place magazines but also to develop the person’s interest in the Bible. Magazine routes are an excellent source of potential Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Make the Most of April and May: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> have won the confidence of millions of appreciative readers. They are so effective in announcing the Kingdom that we should make it a point to carry them with us and offer them at every opportunity. May the months of April and May prove to be outstanding ones for magazine distribution!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —True Evangelizers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ put the responsibility to evangelize on </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font8"> his disciples, specifically directing them to preach the good news of the Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14; Acts 10:42) His early disciples set the pattern in this as they spoke about the Kingdom without letup—not only at places of worship but wherever they met people in public and in going from house to house. (Acts 5:42; 20:20) As Jehovah’s Witnesses today, we have proved ourselves to be true Christian evangelizers, preaching the Kingdom message in 232 lands and baptizing over one million new disciples in just the last three years! Why has our evangelizing work been so successful?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Good News Excites Us: </span><span class="font8">Evangelizers are preachers, or messengers, of good news. As such, we have the exciting privilege of announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom—the only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font8"> good news that can be offered to distressed humanity. We are enthusiastic about the advance knowledge we have gained of a new heavens that will righteously rule a new earth made up of faithful mankind in the coming Paradise. (2 Pet. 3:13, 17) We are the only ones who have embraced this hope, and we are eager to share it with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> True Love Motivates Us: </span><span class="font8">Evangelizing is a lifesaving work. (Rom. 1:16) That is why we experience great joy in spreading the Kingdom message. As true evangelizers, we love people, and that moves us to share the good news with them—our families, neighbors, acquaintances, and as many others as possible. Doing this work whole-souled is one of the finest expressions we can make of our true love for others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">—1 Thess. 2:8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> God’s Spirit Backs Us: </span><span class="font8">God’s Word assures us that when we do our work of planting and watering Kingdom seed, it is Jehovah who “makes it grow.” That is exactly what we see happening in our organization today. (1 Cor. 3:5-7) It is God’s spirit that backs us in our evangelizing activity and gives us great success.—Joel 2:28,29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> In view of the encouragement at 2 Timothy 4:5 to “do the work of an evangellzer” and because of our love for all people, may we be motivated to share the exciting Kingdom good news at every opportunity, confident that Jehovah will continue to bless our work.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If It Gets Results, Use It!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> continually provides us with a variety of suggested presentations for use in the ministry. This gives us fresh ideas on how to create interest in the Kingdom message. It may be that you make an effort each month to learn one or more of these presentations. However, some publishers may find that by the time they have used one of them a few times, another issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> provides new presentations. Obviously it may not be possible for everyone to learn a new presentation before mastering a previous one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> There are, of course, thousands of pioneers and other publishers who spend much time in field service. Furthermore, many congregations work their entire territory every few weeks. Ip these circumstances, publishers appreciate having new approaches and ideas for presenting the message. This helps them to enhance their skills. It also makes their ministry more interesting and fruitful and helps them to meet the challenges encountered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> In any ease, if you have prepared a presentation that works well in cultivating Interest, by all means </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">continue to use it!</span><span class="font8"> It is not necessary to discontinue using an effective presentation that is getting results. Simply adapt it to the literature offer for the current month. As you review the suggestions offered in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> look for interesting points that you may wish to work into your presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> So when you receive a new issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> remember that the presentations it contains are simply </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">suggestions.</span><span class="font8"> If you can use them, fine. But if you have already found a presentation that gets results in your territory, use it! The important thing is to “fully accomplish your ministry” in a fine manner, finding the deserving ones and helping them to become disciples.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of Non-Christian Religions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Having some knowledge of a person’s religious background helps us to give an effective witness about God’s Kingdom. The book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font8"> gives us insight into the world’s major religions so that we can understand people’s beliefs well enough to help them come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> The box on the last page of this insert gives a current list of publications that Jehovah’s organization has provided for use in witnessing to non-Christian people. By reading these publications, we understand how to approach people with the good news. Not to be forgotten as a helpful tool is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book. Pages 21-4 of that book provide practical suggestions on how to respond to Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Being Careful What You Say: </span><span class="font8">We Should be careful not to stereotype people of a certain religion by concluding that their personal beliefs are necessarily the same as those of others of that faith. Instead, endeavor to understand how the individual you are speaking with thinks. (Acts 10:24-35) As a Muslim, Salimoon was brought up to believe that the Koran is God’s word. But he could never fully accept the Muslim teaching that an allmerciful God would torture people in a burning hell. One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses invited him to a meeting. Recognizing the truth at once, he now serves happily as an elder in the Christian congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> When witnessing to those of nonChristian beliefs, we need to be careful that our approach does not cost us the opportu-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">nity to converse with them about the good news. (Acts 24:16) Adherents of some religions are very sensitive about any attempts to convert them from their faith. So be alert to And points on which to build a common ground so as to attract them to the whole truth of God’s Word. Sheeplike ones will respond to a kindly approach and a clear presentation of the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup> Our word choice is also an important consideration, lest we unnecessarily alienate people from our message. For example, if you immediately identify yourself as a Christian, your listener might automatically associate you with Christendom’s churches, which could raise a barrier. It may also be advantageous to refer to the Bible as “the Scriptures” or “the holy writings.”—Matt. 21:42; 2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>16</sup> If you meet a person of a non-Christian religion and feel ill-equipped to offer a witness on the spot, use the opportunity just to get acquainted, leave a tract, and exchange names. Then return in a day or two, after you have adequately prepared to give a witness. —1 Tim. 4:16; 2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Witnessing to Buddhists: </span><span class="font8">(See chapter 6 in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.)</span><span class="font8"> Buddhist beliefs vary greatly from one adherent to another. Rather than advocate the existence of a personal Creator, Buddhism holds the Indian man Buddha Gautama, of the sixth century B.C.E., as a religious ideal. When he first saw a sick man, an old man, and a dead man, Gautama agonized over the meaning of life. ‘Were men born just to suffer, grow old, and die?’ he wondered. Of course, we can answer those questions for sincere Buddhists who want to know the answers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>18</sup> When speaking to Buddhists, stick to the positive message and clear truths that are found in the greatest of all holy books, the Bible. Like most other people, Buddhists are keenly interested in peace, morality, and family life, and they often welcome discussion on these topics. This can lead to your highlighting the Kingdom as the real solution to mankind’s problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>19</sup> In some metropolitan areas in this country, there has been a large influx of Chinese people who hold to Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies. Many are students attending universities in the United States. When a sister in Montana saw a Chinese man in a grocery store, she handed him a tract in his language and offered him a Bible study. He said: “Do you mean the Holy Bible? I have been searching for this my whole life!” He started studying that week and began attending all the meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>20</sup> For over a decade, a pioneer sister in Nevada has been teaching the truth to Chinese students. When working one building with eight apartments occupied by these students, she prayed for Jehovah to help her start a study in each apartment. Within two weeks she was studying with at least one student in each apartment. An approach that works well for her is to say that she has found a common concern among students—they all want peace and happiness. Then she asks if that is their concern too. They always agree. She directs their attention to the brochure </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lasting Peace and Happiness—How to Find Them, </span><span class="font8">which is designed for Chinese people. After having just five study sessions, one student told her he had been searching for the truth for a long time and has now found it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Witnessing to Hindus: </span><span class="font8">(See chapter 5 in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.)</span><span class="font8"> Hinduism has no definite creed. Its philosophy is very complex. Hindus have a trinitarian concept of their major god Brahman (Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Siva the Destroyer). Belief in an immortal soul is essential to their teaching of reincarnation, which tends to give Hindus a fatalistic view of life. (See the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book, pages 317-21, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> May 15,1997, pages 3-8.) Hinduism teaches tolerance, that all religions lead to the same truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>22</sup> An approach to take in witnessing to a Hindu is to explain our Bible-based hope of living forever in human perfection on earth as well as the satisfying answers the Bible gives to the important questions that face all mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Witnessing to Jews: </span><span class="font8">(See chapter 9 in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.)</span><span class="font8"> Unlike other nonChristian religions, Judaism is rooted in history, not in mythology. Through the inspired Hebrew Scriptures, an essential link is provided in mankind’s search for the true God. And yet, contrary to God’s Word, a basic teaching of modern Judaism is belief in an immortal human soul. A common ground can be established by confirming that we worship the God of Abraham and by acknowledging that we face the same difficulties in today’s world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>24</sup> If you meet a Jew who lacks faith in God, asking whether he has always felt that way may help you discern what would best appeal to him. For example, he may never have heard a satisfying explanation as to why God permits suffering. Sincere Jews can be encouraged to reexamine the identity of Jesus as the Messiah, not through Christendom’s misrepresentations of him, but in the way Jewish writers of the Greek Scriptures present him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Witnessing to Muslims: </span><span class="font8">(See chapter 12 in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.)</span><span class="font8"> Muslims (or, Moslems) are adherents of Islam (or, Muhammadanism), which includes belief in Allah as their sole deity and in Muhammad (570-632 C.E.) as his last and most important prophet. Because they do not believe that God had a son, Muslims recognize Jesus Christ as a lesser prophet of God, but nothing more. The Koran, which is less than 1,400 years old, cites both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures. Strong similarities exist between Islam and Catholicism. Both religions teach immortality of the human soul, a state of temporary torment, and the existence of a burning hell.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>26</sup> An obvious common ground is our belief that there is only one true God and that the Bible was inspired by him. A careful reader of the Koran has seen references to the 'i'orah, the Psalms, and the Gospels as being God’s Word and has read that they should be recognized as such and obeyed. Hence, you can offer to study these with the individual.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This presentation might work with someone who identifies himself as a Muslim:</span><span class="font8"> “I have not spoken to many Muslims, but I have read something about a few teachings of your religion in this handbook. [Turn to page 24 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book.] It says you believe that Jesus was a prophet but that Muhammad was the last and most important prophet. Do you also believe that Moses was a true prophet? [Allow for response.] Could I show you what Moses learned from God about His personal name?” Then read Exodus 6:2, 3. On the return visit, you could discuss the subheading “One God, One Religion,” on page 13 in the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Time for True Submission to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>28</sup> Today, many are acting in harmony with the words of Isaiah 55:6, which reads: “Search for Jehovah, you people, while he may be found. Call to him while he proves to be near.” This applies to all honesthearted ones, regardless of the language they speak or their religious background. We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our efforts as we endeavor to go and “make disciples of people of all the nations.”—Matt. 28:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jehovah Is My Helper”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus commissioned his first disciples, he told them: “Look! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves.” (Matt. 10:16) Did that cause them to become apprehensive and hold back? No. They adopted the attitude later expressed by the apostle Paul when he told fellow Christians: “Be of good courage and say: ‘Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?’” (Heb. 13:6) They rejoiced to be counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of Jesus’ name, and they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.—Acts 5:41, 42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Today the worldwide preaching work is in its final stages. Just as Jesus predicted, we have become objects of hatred by all the nations. (Matt. 24:9) Our preaching work has been opposed and ridiculed, and in some parts of the earth, it has even been banned. If we were lacking in faith, we could feel intimidated. However, knowing that Jehovah is our Helper refreshes us and strengthens us to persevere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Courage is the quality of being strong, bold, valiant. It is the opposite of fear, timidity, cowardice. Jesus’ disciples have always needed courage to endure. It is essential if we are to avoid being disheartened by the attitudes and actions of a world at enmity with God. How encouraging it is for us to think of the sterling example of Jesus, a world conquerer! (John 16: 33) Remember, too, the apostles who in the face of severe trials boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” —Acts 5:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> We Are Not the Sort That Shrink Back: </span><span class="font8">We should strive to maintain a positive attitude toward our work. (Heb. 10:39) Always keep in mind that we are being sent out by Jehovah as an expression of his love and mercy toward all mankind. He never asks his servants to do anything that does not serve a useful purpose. Everything we are assigned to do will ultimately be for the good of those who love God—Rom. 8:28.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> An optimistic outlook will help us to keep seeking the sheeplike ones in our territory. We might view the apathy that people display as an expression of their frustration and hopelessness. Let our love move us to be sympathetic and patient. Every time we place literature or otherwise detect a spark of interest, our goal should be to make a return visit promptly and stimulate further interest. We need never doubt our ability to start a Bible study or to be effective in conducting it. Instead, we should constantly and prayerfully seek Jehovah’s assistance and direction, confident that he will help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> We firmly believe that Jehovah will see the work through to its completion. (Compare Philippians 1:6.) Our implicit trust in him as our Helper strengthens us, so that we do “not give up in doing what is fine.”—Gal. 6:9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Extend an Invitation to Everyone Thirsting</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> As foretold by the prophet Amos, the human family today Is suffering from “a thirst, not for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.” (Amos 8:11) To help people in this spiritually parched condition, we tell them about God’s provisions for recovering obedient humans from sin and death, which are depicted in the last chapter of Revelation as being “a river of water of life.” We have the privilege of extending to everyone thirsting for righteousness an invitation to “take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:1, 17) How can we do this during February? By offering to those who are genuinely interested the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span><span class="font8"> You may want to try these presentations:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since many people are concerned about health matters, you might find this approach effective:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Many are concerned about the rising cost of quality health care. Perhaps you have given this matter some thought. [Allow for response.] Is there a permanent solution to this problem? [Wait for a response.] Here is a wonderful prospect.” Read Revelation 22:1, 2. Then open the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font8"> book to the illustration on pages 308-9, and use paragraph 22 on page 311 to explain it. Conclude by saying: “This publication discusses every verse in Revelation.” If the householder shows genuine interest, offer the book, giving him an opportunity to make a donation to the worldwide work. Make arrangements to return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When making the return visit, you could resume your discussion by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “The last time I was here, we talked about a permanent solution to health problems. Do you think the time will ever come when no one will be sick? [Allow for response.] Notice this striking statement.” Read Isaiah 33: 24. Then open to lesson 5 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure, and discuss paragraphs 5-6, asking the corresponding questions at the start of the lesson and looking up a few of the cited scriptures. Mention that the removal of sickness and death is part of the fulfillment of God’s original purpose for the earth. Arrange to return to discuss paragraphs 1-4 and 7 in the same lesson.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If a current news item involving an untimely death has been on people’s minds, you might try this approach: </span><span class="font8">■ “You may have heard about [mention the news item]. When lives are tragically cut short, many wonder what comfort can be offered to the families of the victims. What do you think?&quot; Allow for response. Then open to page 299 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font8"> book, and show the resurrection scene that is illustrated. Continue by saying: “Many are surprised to learn that both righteous and unrighteous people will be brought back to life in Paradise on earth. [Read Acts 24:15 as quoted in paragraph 9 on page 297, and then give the explanation found in paragraph 10.] This book discusses many other interesting details about God’s purpose for the future. If you would like to learn mope about it, you may have this copy.” Make arrangements to return, taking note of the individual's specific interests and concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> When you call again, tailor your presentation to the householder. Perhaps you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “The last time we spoke, I appreciated a comment you made about God’s purpose for the earth. [Repeat the comment.] I located some material I think you will find interesting.” Open the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure to lesson 5. Read and discuss as many paragraphs in that lesson as seem to hold the householder’s attention. After setting a time to return to continue the lesson, give the householder a handbill outlining the meeting times of the congregation. Explain about the Public Meeting, and invite him to attend.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If you prefer a simplified presentation that features a tract, you could say this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “I would like you to have this tract entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?”</span><span class="font8"> Hand it to the householder, and invite him to follow along as you read the first paragraph. Allow him to respond to the question raised in the last sentence. Read the second paragraph, and then open to the illustration on page 299 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font8"> book. Continue by saying: “This book gives more details about the resurrection and the rest of the Bible’s wonderful promises for the future. If you will read it, you may have this copy.” Give the householder the opportunity to make a donation to the worldwide work, and arrange for a return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’Our extending an appealing invitation to others may cause them to come to the waters of life, which Jehovah is now making available. Therefore, let us say to everyone thirsting, “Come!”—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>

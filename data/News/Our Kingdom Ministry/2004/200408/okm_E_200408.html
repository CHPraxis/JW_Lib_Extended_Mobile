<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">August 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America km-E Us 8/04 Vol. 47, No. 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Endurance Is Rewarded</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> “By endurance on your part you will acquire your souls.” (Luke 21:19) Those words, which form part of Jesus’ prophecy concerning “the conclusion of the system of things,” make clear that in keeping our integrity, we must be prepared to face many trials. But in Jehovah’s strength, each of us can ‘endure to the end’ and “be saved.”—Matt. 24:3,13; Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Persecution, health problems, financial difficulties, and emotional distress can make each day a trial. We must never forget, however, that Satan is trying to break our integrity to Jehovah. Each day that we remain loyal to our Father is another day in which we have helped furnish a reply to the Taunter’s challenge. How rewarding it is to know that our “tears” in the face of trial are not forgotten! They are precious to Jehovah, and our integrity makes his heart glad!—Ps. 56:8; Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Refined by Trials: </span><span class="font1">Affliction can show up a weakness of faith or a personality flaw, such as pride or impatience. Rather than seeking to evade or end trials by unscriptural means, we must heed the counsel of God’s Word to “let endurance have its work complete.” Why? Because faithfully enduring trials helps us to become “complete and sound in all respects.” (Jas. 1:2-4) Endurance can help us to cultivate priceless qualities, such as reasonableness, empathy, and mercy.—Rom. 12:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Tested Quality of Faith: </span><span class="font1">When we endure trials, we acquire a tested quality of faith that has great value in the eyes of God. (1 Pet. 1:6, 7) Such faith equips us to remain steadfast through future trials. Moreover, we can sense God’s approval, and this strengthens our hope, making it more real to us. —Rom. 5:3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> The ultimate reward for endurance is highlighted at James 1:12, which says: “Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life.” Hence, let us remain steadfast in our devotion to Jehovah, confident that he will richly reward “those who continue loving him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2: Preparing to Conduct the Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Teaching effectively on a Bible study involves more than just discussing the material and looking up the cited scriptures. We need to present the information in a way that touches the student’s heart. This requires thorough preparation with the student in mind.—Prov. 15:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font1">Begin by praying to Jehovah about the person and his needs. Ask Jehovah to help you reach the student’s heart. (Col. 1:9, 10) To get the theme clearly in mind, take a moment to consider the title of the chapter or lesson, the subheadings, and any visual aids. Ask yourself, ‘What is the thrust of the material?’ This will help you to focus on the main points as you conduct the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Carefully review the material paragraph by paragraph. Identify the answers to the printed questions, marking only the key words and phrases. Analyze how the cited scriptures relate to the main point of the paragraph, and decide which ones to read during the study. You may find it helpful to make brief notes in the margin of the publication. The student should clearly see that what he is learning is from God’s Word.—1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Personalize the Lesson: </span><span class="font1">Next, consider the lesson with the particular student in mind. Try to anticipate his questions and the points that he may have difficulty understanding or accepting. Ask yourself: ‘What does he need to understand or work on in order to make spiritual progress? How can I reach his heart?’ Then adapt your teaching accordingly. At times, you may see a need to prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp the meaning of a certain point or scripture. (Neh. 8:8) But avoid inserting additional information that contributes little to the theme. A brief review at the end of the study will help him to retain the main points.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> What joy we have when new ones bear righteous fruit to Jehovah’s praise! (Phil. 1:11) To help them reach that goal, prepare well each time you conduct a Bible study.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Ministerial Training School —A Large Door That Leads to Activity</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Through the prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah foretold: “I will raise up over [my people] shepherds who will actually shepherd them; and they will be afraid no more, neither will they be struck with any terror, and none will be missing.” (Jer. 23:4) Such a shepherding work is being accomplished today among people of all the nations. This is being done by tens of thousands of congregation elders. In addition, a company of young men as numerous as dewdrops have offered themselves willingly in Jehovah’s service. (Ps. 110:3) What a blessing these humble brothers are to the congregations of God’s people! As the spiritual ingathering work continues, there is yet a need for qualified men to make themselves available to serve their brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> A fine provision to train single elders and ministerial servants for increased responsibilities is the Ministerial Training School. More than 22,000 students from some 140 countries have received this training in the 999 classes that have been held since the school’s inception in 1987. For these brothers, the school has proved to be “a large door that leads to activity.”—1 Cor. 16:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Purpose of the School: </span><span class="font1">The aim of the Ministerial Training School is to train and equip qualified men for responsibilities wherever there may be a need in the organization. The school heightens their abilities for taking the lead in the evangelizing work, sharing in shepherding the flock, and teaching in the congregation. After graduating, some students are assigned as special pioneers or traveling overseers in their home countries or abroad. Others receive assignments to serve with their home congregations or in areas where there is a greater need within the branch territory.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How They Benefited From the Training</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The training has truly enhanced my ministry and my ability to shepherd with wisdom, using the Scriptures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The school has given me a lot more confidence in handling my various responsibilities in the congregation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“It has changed almost every aspect of my life, including the way that I feel about theocracy and God’s organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The training I received helped me appreciate the need to make myself available to serve where there is a need.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> During the eight-week course, students undertake an intensive study of the Bible. They carefully consider a wide array of Bible teachings as well as shepherding responsibilities and guidelines for handling problems in Christian living. They also learn what the Scriptures teach about administrative, judicial, and organizational matters. They receive specialized training in public speaking and are given personal assistance to accelerate their spiritual development.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Requirements: </span><span class="font1">Understandably, the requirements to attend the school are high. Applicants must have served as elders or ministerial servants for at least two consecutive years. All must be single and between the ages of 23 and 50. Applicants must be able to read, write, and speak fluently the language in which the school is conducted, and they must be in good health, not requiring special care or diet. Preference is given to those in regular pioneer service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Those who volunteer must be willing and able to serve wherever they are needed. This calls for a spirit like that of the prophet Isaiah, who eagerly offered himself to do a special work, saying: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) He also demonstrated humility throughout his life. Those making themselves available for the Ministerial Training School should be motivated by love for their brothers and a desire to serve them rather than a desire for prominence or special status. After receiving such fine training, graduates are expected to apply what they learned to the benefit of others. —Luke 12:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Benefits: </span><span class="font1">During the eight weeks of intense training, graduates are “nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:6) This equips them to assist and encourage others in their assigned congregations and circuits. In many locations where graduates of the Ministerial Training School have been assigned, field activity has increased; pioneer service has been encouraged, especially among younger ones; and more personal attention has been given to the many new ones associating with God’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> Are you a single elder or ministerial servant between the ages of 23 and 50? Why not consider applying for the Ministerial Training School? Are you a young brother contemplating your long-range goals in Jehovah’s service? Why not keep your life simple and free of distractions so that you can enter this “large door that leads to activity”? It can bring you much joy and satisfaction. Indeed, the Ministerial Training School has proved to be a blessing not just to the graduates of the school but to the congregations of God’s people worldwide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New Arrangement for Reviewing Assembly Programs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">As Satan’s world continues to advance from bad to worse, Jehovah fortifies us “to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid the present system of things.” (Titus 2: 12) Among the provisions that he makes through “the faithful and discreet slave” are the annual circuit assembly and special assembly day programs. (Matt. 24:45) How strengthening we find these spiritual gatherings to be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To help us to retain and put into practice the instruction that is provided, a new arrangement for reviewing these assembly programs will be used during the 2005 service year. Pages 5-6 of this insert contain articles that provide a preview of what will be presented as well as review questions for each assembly program. Congregations will consider this information at the Service Meeting shortly before and shortly after they attend their assemblies. How will this be arranged?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">One or two weeks before</span><span class="font1"> the congregation attends the circuit assembly, a ten-minute talk based on the article “New Circuit Assembly Program” will be presented on the Service Meeting to build anticipation for the program. The speaker will also draw attention to the review questions and encourage all to take notes in preparation for the review that will follow a few weeks after the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Within a few weeks after </span><span class="font1">the assembly, a 15-minute review of the first day of the assembly program will be included on the Service Meeting. The following week, 15 minutes will be devoted to reviewing the second day of the program. The review questions provided in this insert will serve as the basis for those discussions. The review should focus on the practical value of the information. The elders may arrange to abbreviate, eliminate, or reschedule other Service Meeting parts to accommodate these review sessions.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In these “critical times hard to deal with,” we need godly wisdom to gain and retain Jehovah’s approval. (2 Tim. 3:1) The circuit assembly program for the 2005 service year will provide us with practical counsel and encouragement as it develops the theme “Be Guided by ‘the Wisdom From Above.’”—Jas. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first symposium, “Manifesting ‘the Wisdom From Above’ in Our Life,” will help us to see what is involved in being chaste, peaceable, reasonable, and ready to obey. Then the circuit overseer will give attention to three other aspects of heavenly wisdom. The district overseer will conclude the first day by showing how Christian ministers, although viewed by some as “unlettered and ordinary,” are equipped to speak God’s wisdom.—Acts 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the second day, a symposium entitled “Pursue the Things That Are Upbuilding” will help us to identify and avoid things that can tear us down spiritually. It will also show us how we can build up others at congregation meetings, in the field ministry, and in the family circle. The public talk, “How Godly Wisdom Benefits Us,” will deepen our appreciation for the benefits we receive as we apply divine principles in our lives. The concluding talk, “Acting Upon Divine Wisdom Safeguards Us,” will strengthen our resolve to turn to Jehovah for wisdom during these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A highlight of every assembly is the baptism of new disciples. The Theocratic Ministry School and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Study for the week will also be featured on the program. Jehovah desires all of us to benefit from the wisdom he provides. We will be spiritually enriched by the counsel and encouragement that await us at our circuit assembly.—Prov. 3:13-18.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">If we see or hear a warning signal but do not act on it, the results could be disastrous. It is even more important to act on the spiritual direction that Jehovah provides. This will be emphasized in the special assembly day program for the coming service year. The theme is “Pay Attention to How You Listen.”—-Luke 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his first talk, the visiting speaker will consider how the counsel in the opening chapters of Paul’s inspired letter to the Hebrews applies to us today. In the concluding talk, “Pay Constant Attention to Divine Instruction,” he will help all to examine whether they are truly listening to Jehovah, his Son, and “the faithful and discreet slave.”—Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several parts on the program will be especially beneficial for families. “Families That Listen Without Distraction to God’s Word” will help us to keep the things of the world from choking our spirituality. It will include interviews of those who have made changes in order to put spiritual things in first place. “How Attentive Listening to God’s Word Fortifies Our Youths” will include interviews of youths who have taken a stand for the truth at school, with their peers, or in the ministry. “Little Ones Who Listen to God and Learn” will help us not to underestimate the learning ability of young ones. Interviews with young ones and their parents will help us to see the good that comes from training children from infancy in Jehovah’s ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While Satan “is misleading the entire inhabited earth,” Jehovah is showing his faithful servants the way in which they should walk. (Rev. 12:9; Isa. 30:21) Listening attentively to his counsel and obediently applying it in our lives make us wise, bring us happiness, and lead to everlasting life.—Prov. 8:32-35.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">'Whether they can serve as pioneers at present or not, all Kingdom publishers can manifest the pioneer spirit. They are intensely concerned with the command to preach and make disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 18:5) They care about people and make sacrifices in order to accomplish their ministry. (Matt. 9:36; Acts 20:24) Jehovah’s servants are willing to do whatever is needed to help others learn the truth. (1 Cor. 9:1923) Let us consider the example of one who showed such a spirit, Philip the evangelizer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preaching and Teaching: </span><span class="font1">Philip cared for weighty responsibilities in the first-century congregation. (Acts 6:1-6) Yet, he was foremost a zealous preacher of the good news. (Acts 8:40) So today, while caring for their assigned duties, elders and ministerial servants can demonstrate the pioneer spirit by taking an enthusiastic lead in the ministry. How this invigorates the spirit of the congregation! —Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’Following Stephen’s death, a wave of persecution caused great disruption in the lives of the disciples. Philip, however, continued to preach, and he was instrumental in opening up the work among the Samaritans. (Acts 8:1, 4-6, 12, 1417) We can imitate his example by continuing to make known the good news when we undergo trials and by preaching impartially to all whom we meet. —John 4:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1 . How would you describe the pioneer spirit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2 . How can elders and ministerial servants imitate Philip’s zeal for the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3 . How can we display the pioneer spirit when we face trials?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Philip’s skill as a teacher of God’s Word can be seen in the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch. (Acts 8:26-38) Developing the ability to use the Bible and to ‘reason from the Scriptures’ is yet another way that we manifest the pioneer spirit. (Acts 17:2, 3) Like Philip, we seek to share the good news wherever people can be found and on every appropriate occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Family and Congregation: </span><span class="font1">Philip’s attitude and example no doubt had a positive effect on his daughters. (Acts 21:9) Similarly, Christian parents who center their lives on Kingdom interests encourage their children to do the same. Although tired from a busy week, a parent who eagerly preaches to others can leave a lasting impression on the heart of a child. —Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Philip extended hospitality to Paul and Luke, zealous Christians who were expending themselves in Jehovah’s service. (Acts 21:8, 10) How can we show our appreciation and support for zealous ones today? Perhaps we could offer to work with the pioneers for a morning or an afternoon on a day when few share in the ministry. (Phil. 2:4) We can also invite them to our homes for upbuilding association. Whatever our circumstances, may all of us strive to demonstrate the pioneer spirit.</span></p></li></ul>

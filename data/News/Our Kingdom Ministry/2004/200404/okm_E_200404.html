<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering Jehovah Our Best</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s Law to Israel stipulated that animals presented to him in sacrifice had to be “sound.” A defective animal was unacceptable. (Lev. 22:18-20; Mal. 1:6-9) Furthermore, when a sacrifice was made, all the fat —the richest part—belonged to Jehovah. (Lev. 3:14-16) As Israel’s Father and Grand Master, Jehovah deserved the very best.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> As in ancient times, God is keenly interested in the quality of our offerings today. Our service should reflect proper reverence for Jehovah. Of course, circumstances vary from person to person. Yet, we have good reason to scrutinize ourselves to make sure that we are giving him our best.—Eph. 5:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Wholehearted Service: </span><span class="font1">In order for our ministry to honor Jehovah and touch the hearts of our listeners, it cannot be perfunctory. Our expressions regarding our God and his grand purposes should spring from hearts brimming with appreciation. (Ps. 145:7) This highlights the importance of maintaining a good program of personal Bible reading and study. —Prov. 15:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Giving Jehovah our best also involves imitating his love for people. (Eph. 5:1, 2) Love for people will motivate us to try to reach as many as possible with the life-giving message of truth. (Mark 6:34) It moves us to show personal interest in those to whom we speak. It keeps us thinking about them after the initial call and prompts us to return. It impels us to do all we can to help them progress spiritually—Acts 20:24; 26:28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> “A Sacrifice of Praise”: </span><span class="font1">Another way we give Jehovah our best is by our diligence in the ministry. When we are well-organized and focused on the work at hand, we can accomplish the most good in the time we have available. (1 Tim. 4: 10) Good preparation enables us to speak with clarity and conviction, thereby increasing the likelihood of a favorable response. (Prov. 16:21) As we share the good news with others, our heartfelt expressions can rightly be called “a sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Young People—Read God’s Word!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">‘Youth is a time of challenges and weighty decisions. Many of you Christian youths are daily confronted with pressure to violate divine standards of conduct. As you begin to make personal decisions regarding education, employment, and marriage, you should already have set your spiritual goals. Only in that way can you make other decisions that will shape the rest of your life for good. Well-defined spiritual goals will help you to act wisely and make your way successful. By reading and meditating on God’s Word regularly, you will be moved to live in harmony with its inspired counsel, and your right endeavors will meet with success.—Josh. 1:8; Ps. 1: 2, 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How Will It Benefit You? </span><span class="font1">Satan’s world is full of enticements to engage in wrongdoing. (1 John 2:15, 16) You may know of classmates or others your age who have experienced calamity because of yielding to peer pressure. Adhering to Bible counsel will give you the moral and spiritual strength to reject a sinful course. Further, the counsel of God’s Word can help you to avoid Satan’s subtle snares. (2 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 5: 14) Walking in God’s ways will bring you true happiness—personal satisfaction with your course in life.—Ps. 119:1, 9, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The timeless principles of God’s Word surpass human wisdom. (Ps. 119:98-100) Familiarity with Bible principles and meditation on Jehovah’s revealed purposes along with heartfelt prayer can help you to build a close relationship with the Bible’s all-wise Author, Jehovah God. He promises: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you.”—Ps. 32:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Make Time to Read It: </span><span class="font1">One young Christian made it her goal to read the entire Bible, and she finished within a year. How did she benefit? She recalls: “I learned so much about Jehovah—things that drew me closer to him and made me want to fear him for the rest of my life.” (Jas. 4:8) Have you read the entire Bible? If not, why not make it your goal to do so? Jehovah will certainly bless your efforts, and you will reap great rewards.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Walk With God” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat pointed counsel from this month’s insert that applies locally. During the month of October, an entire Service Meeting will be arranged to review highlights of the convention program. In preparation for that discussion, all of us can take meaningful notes at the convention, including a list of specific points that we wish to apply personally in our own life and in the field ministry. Then we can encourage others by explaining how we have applied the suggestions.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Let Us Exalt His Name Together”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “O magnify Jehovah with me, . . . and let us exalt his name together,” sang the psalmist. (Ps. 34:3) Our upcoming “Walk With God” District Convention will give us the opportunity to exalt Jehovah’s name together with our brothers and sisters from many congregations. Have you made your arrangements for accommodations, transportation, and time off from secular work? We are wise to care for these well in advance.—Prov. 21:5.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">Ways to Exalt God’s Name</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Advance planning</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Show love for others</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">■ Prepare your heart</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Arriving at the Convention Site: </span><span class="font16">There are many matters to care for when we attend a convention. Getting an early start will help us to cope with unexpected delays and will enable us to be settled in our seats in time to share wholeheartedly in the opening song and prayer. (Ps. 69: 30) A few minutes before the start of the session, the chairman will be seated on the platform while introductory Kingdom music is played. All of us should take our seats at that time so that the program can begin in a dignified manner.—1 Cor. 14:33, 40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> God’s Word admonishes us to ‘let all our affairs take place with love.’ (1 Cor. 16:14) When the doors open at 8:00 a.m., consideration for others will restrain us from running, rushing, pushing, or shoving in an effort to get to the seats we prefer before others do. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.—l</span><span class="font16"> Cor. 13:5; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Please bring a lunch rather than leave</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">2. Why is it beneficial to plan to arrive at the convention site early?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. How can we show consideration for others when finding seats?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">4. What are the arrangements for the noon break, and how is this beneficial? </span><span class="font16">the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. This will allow all to enjoy upbuilding association and be present from the very start of the afternoon session. If necessary, a small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers, glass containers, and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> For the benefit of those with impaired hearing, the program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. An announcement regarding this will be made at the beginning of the first session. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> A Spiritual Banquet Awaits Us: </span><span class="font16">King Jehoshaphat was one who “prepared [his] heart to search for the true God.” (2 Chron. 19:3) How can we prepare our heart before the convention? The articles on the back page of the May 22 and June 8 issues of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> provide a preview of the spiritual banquet that will be served. Why not take time to reflect on those articles, building anticipation for what Jehovah has in store for us? Preparing our heart also involves asking Jehovah to help us get the sense of the instruction we will receive and apply it.—Ps. 25:4, 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> We all long to learn more from the Word of God, realizing that by means of it we can grow to salvation. (1 Pet. 2:2) Hence, let us be in attendance for our “Walk With God” District Convention and ‘exalt Jehovah’s name together.’—Ps. 34:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Spiritual Food at the Proper Time</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “I will... call to the grain and make it abound, and I shall put upon you no famine,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. (Ezek. 36:29) Those prophetic words apply to God’s people today. Figuratively speaking, Jehovah has caused life-sustaining grain to sprout up abundantly for his people. The timely spiritual food provided through our district conventions well illustrates this fact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> At the convention held at Columbus, Ohio, in 1931, Jehovah directed his worshipers to take on a new name—Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Isa. 43:10-12) In 1935 the great crowd of Revelation 7:9-17 was correctly identified. In 1942, Brother Knorr delivered the discourse “Peace—Can It Last?” That talk gave impetus to the global preaching work and led to the formation of the Watchtower</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Bible School of Gilead. Although some conventions are especially memorable, each one has proved to be a well-laden table of nourishing spiritual food served at the right time.—Ps. 23:5; Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How Well Are You Eating? </span><span class="font16">It is possible to be surrounded by food and yet be malnourished if we do not put forth the effort to eat. (Prov. 26:15) The same is true in a spiritual sense. At a few conventions, it has been observed that many are needlessly walking around or talking with others during the program.

<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. What must we do to benefit from the spiritual banquet at our district convention? </span><span class="font16">this is before and after each session. (Eccl. 3:1, 7) If we are not in our seats paying close attention, we may miss a vital point. Convention department overseers and brothers with assignments may occasionally find it necessary to discuss convention matters while the sessions are in progress. Otherwise, they should set an example by their attentiveness to the program. None of us can afford to miss any of the spiritual food provided. —1 Cor. 10:12; Phil. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> How we rejoice in the rich spiritual truths Jehovah provides, as contrasted with the dried-out false doctrines of Christendom! (Isa. 65:13, 14) One way we can ‘show ourselves thankful’ is by viewing the convention as an opportunity to be taught by Jehovah. (Col. 3:15) Look beyond the brother giving the talk, and view the message as coming from our “Grand Instructor.” (Isa. 30:20, 21; 54: 13) Pay rapt attention. Take brief notes of key points. Review program highlights each evening. Apply what you learn.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Every convention on this side of Armageddon, whether it is held in a refugee camp, in a war-torn land, or in a larger more peaceful setting, is a victory over Satan! As a united brotherhood, we cherish our opportunities to flock together at district conventions. (Ezek. 36:38) We are confident that once again Jehovah will lovingly provide us with “food supplies at the proper time.”—Luke 12:42.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">4. How can we show ourselves thankful for the bounty Jehovah provides?</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> As servants of the holy God, Jehovah, we strive to be holy in all our conduct. (1 Pet. 1:15,16) This means that we endeavor to uphold Jehovah’s standards in all aspects of our lives. The district convention this year will provide us with a special opportunity to display holy conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> At Hotels: </span><span class="font16">One manager of a hotel used by convention delegates last year said: “Jehovah’s Witnesses were such nice people to have here.... You are the type of people we want.” Observing the following reminders will help us to maintain our good reputation: (1) Do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it. (4) Do not cook in noncooking rooms. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day.

<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Our good manners can give a powerful witness. Last year a young Witness politely asked a hotel desk clerk for some stationery and then thanked her. This touched the clerk, and she was heard to remark: “You just don’t see young ones with such polite manners anymore.” However, in a few cases, unsupervised children have been observed swimming, playing in elevators, talking loudly, and running in hallways. Parents should not allow their children to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> At Restaurants: </span><span class="font16">A waiter in a restaurant near one convention commented: “Witnesses are different. They show respect for others.” Good conduct includes avoiding loud speech and laughter that may disturb others who are dining. We should also remember that in many places it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service. Even when eating and drinking, we seek to do all things for God’s glory.—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> At the Convention: </span><span class="font16">Especially should our fine conduct be in evidence at the convention site. Please cooperate with the attendants’ direction, both in the parking lot and in the auditorium. (Heb. 13: 17) Families should sit together rather than allow their children, including teenagers, to sit with groups of other young people. Recorders of any type should not be connected to the facility’s electrical or sound system and may only be used in a way that does not disturb others. If you intend to take pictures, no flash should be used during sessions. Pagers and cell phones should be set so as not to cause a distraction. If you observe an accident in the facility, instead of calling 911, please inform an attendant or the First Aid Department. Qualified medical assistance is available on site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Our conduct sets us apart from others and glorifies our God. (1 Pet. 2:12) At the convention, the actions of Jehovah’s Witnesses will be on display. Therefore, be determined to be holy in all your conduct.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Chaste, Praiseworthy Personal Appearance</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah’s Witnesses are the best! Your people are kind and well dressed, and they exhibit deep respect.” So said a hotel representative about the brothers and sisters at one district convention last year. At another convention, a hotel worker commented: “It is evident that your people dress for God.” Yes, convention delegates are noticed by others. We therefore want to dress “in a manner worthy of the good news,” and this often moves outsiders to compliment us and makes it obvious that we are ministers of God. (Phil. 1:27) As we prepare for the district convention, it is appropriate to give advance thought to our appearance.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> “The wisdom from above is first of all chaste,” wrote the disciple James. (Jas. 3:17) Reflecting chasteness in our appearance can be a challenge. Satan’s immoral world influences people to adopt immodest, sensual, and outlandish styles that are not befitting. (1 John 2:15-17) Hence, when making decisions regarding dress and grooming, we need to heed the Bible’s admonition to “repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind . . . amid this present system of things.” (Titus 2:12) Never would we want to disturb others by our appearance, be they our brothers, hotel and restaurant personnel, or other observers. —1 Cor. 10:32, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Modest, Well-Arranged Dress: </span><span class="font16">When preparing for the convention, ask yourself: ‘Is my clothing modest, or does it</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. In preparation for the district convention, why should we give consideration to our appearance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. Why is it a challenge to dress and groom oneself in a chaste manner?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. What questions will help us to examine our personal appearance?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">draw undue attention to me? Does it show respect for the feelings of others? Are my blouses too low at the neckline or too short? Are my dresses revealing or tight? Is my clothing clean and free of offensive odors? When obtaining complimentary breakfast provisions at the hotel or relaxing after the program, will I have the neat, clean appearance of a minister, or will my clothing be sloppy, faddish, overly casual, and inappropriate for a convention delegate wearing a badge card? Would the clothing I wear during leisure time make me embarrassed to witness informally?’—Rom. 15:2, 3; 1 Tim. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> We can benefit from the observations of mature Christians. Wives should ask their husbands how their clothing might appear to others. Godly parents can help their teenage children in this regard. Moreover, reverent older sisters can “recall the young women to their senses . . . to be sound in mind, chaste” in their appearance “so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.” (Titus 2:3-5) Our publications provide helpful illustrations depicting modest, well-arranged dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Bring Praise to Jehovah: </span><span class="font16">District conventions provide an excellent opportunity for all of us, not just program participants, to praise Jehovah. Of course, our Christian conduct and speech will honor him. But the first thing many observers notice about us is our dress and grooming. May all of us bring praise to Jehovah by our chaste, praiseworthy personal appearance.—Ps. 148:12,13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">■ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2004 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If the congregation needs additional badge cards, these should be requested on the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Request Form</span><span class="font14"> (S-14). Plastic badge holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ DISTRICT CONVENTION PARKING: At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. No parking tickets will be used, but convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Being aware that considerable expense is involved, we can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Imitate Jesus’ Mental Attitude</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Although we have never seen God’s Son, through the written record of Jesus’ life and ministry, we have truly come to love him. (1 Pet. 1:8) In obedience to his Father’s will, he forsook his exalted heavenly position and came to earth. As a human, he selflessly ministered to others and then gave his life in behalf of mankind. (Matt. 20:28) God’s Word urges us: “Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus.” How can we imitate his self-sacrificing spirit?—Phil. 2: 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> When Feeling Tired: </span><span class="font1">Even though Jesus was perfect, he still got tired. On one occasion, when he was “tired out from the journey,” he gave a thorough witness to a Samaritan woman. (John 4:6) Many Christians today face a similar challenge. After a tiring workweek, it can be difficult to find the strength to participate in the preaching work. However, if we do so regularly, we will find that the Christian ministry refreshes us spiritually.—John 4:32-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> On another occasion, Jesus and his disciples headed to a lonely place in order to rest up a bit. However, a great crowd found out and ran ahead to meet them. Rather than becoming irritated, Jesus was “moved with pity for them” and proceeded to “teach them many things.” (Mark 6:30-34)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What mental attitude did Jesus manifest?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. What challenge do many Christians face, and what can help them to overcome it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. How can we imitate Jesus’ willingness to teach?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Starting and conducting Bible studies calls for a similar attitude. It requires persistent effort and genuine love for people. If you are not presently conducting a Bible study, do not give up in trying to find one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Put Spiritual Interests First: </span><span class="font1">Auxiliary pioneering can help us to focus more on spiritual activities. One young sister wrote: “The mother of one of my friends encouraged both of us to auxiliary pioneer with her for a month. I’m really glad that we joined her. I enjoyed getting to know the brothers and sisters better, and soon they were like family to me. I also enjoyed having more of an opportunity to speak to others about Jehovah and teach them wonderful Kingdom truths. All of this made me feel closer to Jehovah and his organization.” —Ps. 34:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> All of us face a battle between our imperfect flesh and our desire to please Jehovah. (Rom. 7:21-23) We must resist the self-sparing spirit of the world. (Matt. 16:22, 23) Jehovah can help us to succeed in this by means of his holy spirit. (Gal. 5:16, 17) As we await our deliverance into God’s righteous new world, may we imitate Jesus’ mental attitude by putting Kingdom interests and the interests of others ahead of our own.—Matt. 6:33; Rom. 15:1-3.</span></p>

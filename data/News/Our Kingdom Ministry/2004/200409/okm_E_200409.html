<p><span class="font14">We rejoice to announce that, with Jehovah’s blessing, the new presses and bindery at Wallkill are now in operation. We warmly invite all of you to tour these streamlined facilities. How grateful we are to the brothers and sisters from seven nearby Regional Building Committees who have thus far contributed over 67,000 manhours to this project! One such volunteer remarked: “It was more than a privilege. It was a dream come true for me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In Brooklyn, brothers are now working diligently to renovate the 117 Adams Street complex in preparation for the laundry and other essential support departments that are relocating there after the recent sale of the 360 Furman Street building. Hundreds of skilled workers from Regional Building Committees across the country are ‘offering themselves willingly’ in response to a special invitation to assist in this effort. (Ps. 110:3) The first of these volunteers arrived in August. Your heartfelt support of the expansion of pure worship endears you to us and to our appreciative God, Jeho-vah.-2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We are pleased to report that a new peak of 2,303,015 attended the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal. Along with you, we look forward to “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord” as we begin the 2005 service year.-l Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Your brothers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">U.</span><span class="font16"> &lt;J? </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">QBnmcA' Office</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus called attention to the tremendous influence that the figurative or spiritual eye can exercise on our entire life course. He said: “If, then, your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright; but if your eye is wicked, your whole body will be dark.” (Matt. 6:22, 23) A simple eye is one that is focused on a single purpose-doing God’s will—not being distracted by undue anxiety over material things. (Matt. 6:19-21, 24-33) What can help us to maintain a simple eye?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Cultivating Contentment: </span><span class="font15">Providing adequately for the needs of one’s household is a Scriptural obligation. (1 Tim. 5:8) But this does not require that we engage in an endless quest for the best and latest things. (Prov. 27: 20; 30:8, 9) Rather, the Scriptures urge us to be content with “sustenance and covering,” the necessities of life. (1 Tim. 6:8; Heb. 13:5, 6) Heeding this counsel can help us to keep our eye in proper focus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> We are wise to avoid burdening ourselves with unnecessary debt and with</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What does it mean to have a simple eye, and why is this important?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. What view of material things does God’s Word encourage?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. What can help us to avoid selfimposed burdens? </span><span class="font15">possessions or pursuits that require much time and attention. (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) How can we do this? When contemplating a course of action, prayerfully weigh the matter and honestly evaluate whether it will infringe on spiritual pursuits. Be determined to keep spiritual things first in your life. —Phil. 1:10; 4:6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Simplify Your Life-Style: </span><span class="font15">Another aid to resisting the pull of materialism is to seek to simplify your life-style. One brother who found that his family could manage well without excess material goods said: “I can now do so much more in the congregation to serve my brothers. I am convinced that Jehovah blesses all of his servants when they put true worship ahead of personal interests.” Could you enjoy greater blessings by simplifying your life-style?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Constant effort is needed to resist the influence of Satan, his materialistic world, and our own imperfect flesh. Rather than allowing our eyes to wander, let us keep them fixed on doing God’s will and on our precious hope of everlasting life.—Prov. 4:25; 2 Cor. 4:18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">4. Why should we look for ways to simplify our life-style?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">5. Why is constant effort required to keep our eye simple?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We Must Respect Jehovah’s Authority</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">With what do you associate the ancient names Korah, Da-than, and Abiram? Rebellion! Against what? Godly authority. The details of their tragic course are recorded in Numbers chapter 16, and an overview of the matter is provided in the article “Loyally Submit to Godly Authority” in the August 1, 2002, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> You would find it beneficial to read this material and then view the sobering portrayal of it in the video </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Respect Jehovah’s Authority.</span><span class="font14"> You will see the conflict that developed between the faithful sons of Korah and their rebellious father, who was on a collision course with the Sovereign of the universe. (Num. 26:9-11) This true-life drama should inspire all of us to develop our loyalty to Jehovah even more fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As you watch the video, look for the evidence that Korah and his fellow rebels failed the test of loyalty in six crucial areas: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font14">How did they disrespect godly authority? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font14">How did they let pride, ambition, and jealousy affect them? (3) How did they focus on the deficiencies of those appointed by Jehovah? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font14">What complaining attitude had they developed? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) </span><span class="font14">Why had they become dissatisfied with their privileges of service? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font14">How did they let friends and family take precedence over loyalty to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Consider how the lessons learned in this Bible drama apply to our personal view of godly authority today: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font14">How should we respond to the decisions of elders in the congregation, and why? (2) How can we counteract any improper motives within us? (3) How should we react to the imperfections of those appointed to take the lead? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font14">What should we do if a complaining spirit begins to develop in our heart? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) </span><span class="font14">How should we feel about any privileges we have been given? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font14">Who should never take priority over our loyalty to God, and when might this become a difficult test for us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After this information is discussed in the congregation, why not watch the video again? Let it doubly impress upon your mind the reasons why we must always respect Jehovah’s authority!—Ps. 18:25; 37:28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Regardless of what literature we plan to offer in the ministry, it is beneficial to select a thought-provoking scripture to share with those who will listen.

In some areas, publishers have found it beneficial to carry the Bible in their hand when approaching a person or when working from house to house.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Open With a Scripture: </span><span class="font15">Some publishers open their presentation by asking the householder a simple viewpoint question on a Bible text that they then proceed to read.

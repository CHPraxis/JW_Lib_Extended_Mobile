<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep a Sense of Urgency!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">‘Jesus knew that the time he had on earth to accomplish his Father’s work was limited. (John 9:4) Hence, he carried out his ministry with a sense of urgency, and he trained his disciples to do the same. (Luke 4: 42-44; 8:1; 10:2-4) Material comforts were of secondary importance to him. (Matt. 8:20) Thus, he was able to finish the work Jehovah had given him to do. —John 17:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Limited Time: </span><span class="font12">The time to preach the good news in “all the inhabited earth” is also limited. (Matt. 24:14) Bible prophecy reveals that we are living deep in the time of the end. Soon “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus ... will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction.” (2 Thess. 1:6-9) That judgment will arrive with striking suddenness. (Luke 21:34,35; 1 Thess. 5:2, 3) People need to wake up to their perilous situation. It is our responsibility to help them to seek Jehovah’s favor while there is yet time. —Zeph. 2:2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Doing All We Can: </span><span class="font12">Recognizing that “the time left is reduced,” God’s servants give priority to the preaching work. (1 Cor. 7:29-31; Matt. 6:33) Some have forgone economic opportunities or other personal pursuits in order to increase their share in the ministry. (Mark 10:29, 30) Others continue to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord” despite enduring trials. (1 Cor. 15:58) Many have been publicly declaring the good news for decades without wavering. (Heb. 10:23) Jehovah highly values all such sacrifices in support of Kingdom interests.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Centering our lives on the worship of Jehovah, which includes the preaching work, helps us to keep Jehovah’s day close in mind. It protects us from becoming distracted by Satan’s world and fortifies our resolve to maintain holy conduct. (2 Pet. 3:11-14) Indeed, carrying out our ministry with a sense of urgency can be lifesaving, both for ourselves and for those who listen to us. —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Extend a Helping Hand?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">‘Jehovah is always looking for ways to extend a helping hand to his loyal servants. (2 Chron. 16:9; Isa. 41:10, 13) Likening him to a caring shepherd, Isaiah wrote: “With his arm he will collect together the lambs; and in his bosom he will carry them. Those giving suck he will conduct with care.” (Isa. 40:11) Consider some ways in which we can imitate Jehovah’s loving concern.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Reach Out to New Ones: </span><span class="font12">We can extend a helping hand by inviting new ones to enjoy upbuilding association with us. (Prov. 13:20) Recalling </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font12"> others reached out to him when he began associating with the congregation, one brother said: “On several occasions, a family included me in their family study. As I progressed, a young pioneer couple regularly invited me to join them for full days in the ministry. We always had great spiritual conversations.” He added: “Before becoming a Christian, I used to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. But the time I spent with the brothers filled my need for association.” The loving interest of the congregation helped this brother to become well rooted and stabilized in the faith, and he now serves as a member of the Bethel family.—Col. 2:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Build One Another Up: </span><span class="font12">We may discern an opportunity to extend a helping hand when our brothers face challenging circumstances. Could you arrange to do telephone witnessing with an infirm publisher or invite him to accompany you on a Bible study, perhaps even bringing the student to his home? Might a parent with small children appreciate a helping hand when sharing in the ministry? Are there timid ones who would welcome your assistance when making return visits or when engaging in some other facet of the ministry? Loving interest in our brothers will move us to look for ways to build them up. —Rom. 14:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As we imitate Jehovah’s tender concern for his servants, we strengthen one another, help draw the congregation together in love, and glorify our heavenly Father. —Eph. 4:16.</span></p>

This material can be used for short, meaningful follow-up discussions. For example, if pages 3-4 were featured on the initial call, the highlighted section “Does God Really Care?” on page 5 could be used to make a return visit. Discuss how that could be done. Review other highlighted sections, such as those on pages 6-8 and 1718 or others appropriate for the local territory. Demonstrate a return visit, using one of the highlighted sections.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">■ How should we care for congregation assignments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The orderly functioning of a congregation of Jehovah’s people is the result of united effort. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) Think of what is involved with just one congregation meeting. Besides the program itself, there is much activity before and after the meeting as brothers and sisters care for various assignments. Other duties that are cared for out of public view are also important. How can each of us contribute to this arrangement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Make yourself available. </span><span class="font12">Those with a willing spirit will find plenty of things to do. (Ps. 110:3) Show concern for the sick and elderly. Assist with the cleaning of the Kingdom Hall. We can perform many beneficial deeds without a special invitation. We simply need a desire to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Serve modestly.</span><span class="font12"> Modest people are happy serving others. (Luke 9:48) Modesty will prevent us from taking on more than we can realistically handle. Further, modesty will keep us from exceeding the limits of our authority.—Prov. 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Be trustworthy.</span><span class="font12"> Moses was encouraged to select “trustworthy men” to handle positions of responsibility in ancient Israel. (Ex. 18:21) This same quality is needed today. Conscientiously care for each assignment you receive. (Luke 16:10) If you are unable to fulfill an assignment, make sure that appropriate arrangements are made for someone to care for it in your absence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Give your best.</span><span class="font12"> Christians are exhorted to work whole-souled even in secular matters. (Col. 3:22-24) There is greater reason to do so when working to advance true worship. Even if a task appears to be lowly or insignificant, it is a blessing to the congregation when it is done well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Each assignment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate our love for Jehovah and our brothers. (Matt. 22:37-39) May we faithfully care for whatever duties are entrusted to us.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our purpose in conducting Bible studies is to “make disciples” by helping people to understand and accept the teachings of God’s Word and apply them in their lives. (Matt. 28: 19, 20; 1 Thess. 2:13) Therefore, the study should center on the Scriptures. At first, it may be helpful to show students how to find specific texts in their own copy of the Bible. How, though, can we use the Scriptures to help such ones to progress spiritually?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Select Texts to Read: </span><span class="font12">In your preparation, determine how each cited scripture in the lesson applies to the point under consideration, and decide which ones you will look up and discuss during the study. Generally, it is good to read those that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs. Texts that provide background information may not need to be read. Take into consideration the needs and circumstances of each student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Use Questions: </span><span class="font12">Instead of explaining Bible texts to the student, have him explain them to you. You can prompt him to do this by the skillful use of questions. If the application of a scripture is obvious, you might simply ask how the text supports what is stated in the paragraph. In other cases, a more specific question or se-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">3 . What is the benefit of using questions, and how can we do this? ries of questions may be needed to direct the student to the proper conclusion. If further explanations are needed, these can be made after the student has responded.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Keep It Simple: </span><span class="font12">A skilled archer often needs just one arrow to hit a target. Similarly, a skilled teacher does not require many words to make a point. He can convey information simply, clearly, and accurately. At times, you may need to do research in Christian publications to understand a scripture and explain it correctly. (2 Tim. 2:15) But avoid trying to explain every aspect of each scripture in the study. Include only what is needed to make the point under consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Practical Application: </span><span class="font12">When appropriate, help the student to see how Bible texts apply to him personally. For example, when considering Hebrews 10:24, 25 with a student who is not yet attending Christian meetings, you might discuss one of the meetings and invite him to attend it. But avoid pressuring him. Allow God’s Word to motivate him to take the action needed to please Jehovah—Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> As we carry out the commission to make disciples, may we “promote obedience by faith” through our effective use of the Scriptures.—Rom. 16:26.</span></p></li></ul>

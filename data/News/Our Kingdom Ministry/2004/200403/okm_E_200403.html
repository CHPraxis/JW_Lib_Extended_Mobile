<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Love Jehovah, All You Loyal Ones” Jesus’ Death to Be Commemorated on April 4</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Years ago, when Ukraine was under Communist rule, the authorities watched the brothers closely—especially when the day of the Lord’s Evening Meal approached—because they hoped to discover their meeting place. This was always a problem, since the authorities knew the approximate date of the commemoration. What could the brothers do? One sister’s home had a flooded basement. Since the authorities would not expect people to gather there, the brothers built a platform above the knee-deep water. Although they had to sit crouched on the platform under a low ceiling, nobody disturbed them as the congregation joyfully observed the Memorial.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The determination of our Ukrainian brothers to obey the command to commemorate Jesus’ death was a marvelous demonstration of their love for God. (Luke 22:19; 1 John 5:3) Whenever we are facing obstacles in our lives, may we draw encouragement from such examples and be determined to be present to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal on April 4. By so doing, we show that we share the sentiments of the psalmist who sang: “O love Jehovah, all you loyal ones of his.” —Ps. 31:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Help Others Grow in Love for God: </span><span class="font11">Love for God also moves us to invite others to observe the commemoration with us. The February </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> insert encouraged each of us to make a list of those we plan to invite to the Memorial. Are you diligently following through in extending an invitation to each person on your list? Take time to explain the significance of the occasion to them. A kindly reminder of the day and time of the Memorial and, if appropriate, an offer to accompany them may encourage them to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> At the observance, make a special effort to greet those who have accepted our invitation, and make them feel welcome. How can you help them to grow in their love for Jehovah? Make yourself available to answer their questions. Be alert to offer a Bible study if appropriate. Invite them to attend our weekly congregation meetings. Especially will elders want to give attention to inactive Christians who are present. They can arrange to visit such ones and encourage them to resume their activity, perhaps building on the thoughts presented in the Memorial discourse.—Rom. 5:6-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Deepening Our Own Love for Jehovah: </span><span class="font11">Reflecting on the gift of the ransom can deepen our love for Jehovah and his Son. (2 Cor. 5: 14,15) One long-time Memorial attender said: “We look forward to the Memorial. It becomes more special each year. I remember standing in the funeral home 20 years ago, looking at my dear dad and coming to a true heartfelt appreciation for the ransom. It had been an academic subject before that. Oh, I knew all the scriptures and how to explain them! But only when I felt the cold reality of death did my heart fairly leap with joy over what will be accomplished for us by means of that precious ransom.”—John 5:28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> As the date of this year’s observance approaches, take time to prepare your heart for the occasion. (2 Chron. 19:3) Meditate on the special Memorial Bible reading, which is outlined in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily—2004 </span><span class="font11">and on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">2004 Calendar.</span><span class="font11"> Some enjoy reviewing chapters 112-16 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book during their family study. Others do additional research using other study aids provided through the faithful and discreet slave class. (Matt. 24:45-47) All of us can make the gift of the ransom a matter of heartfelt prayer. (Ps. 50:14, 23) Yes, during this Memorial season, may we continually reflect on Jehovah’s love for us and seek ways to demonstrate our love for him.—Mark 12:30; 1 John 4:10.</span></p>

When using the brochure, concentrate on starting home Bible studies. ■ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each month</span><span class="font10"> before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ It is important that groups of 20 or more persons planning to visit the branch office facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The branch office will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Lodging information has been sent to the congregation elder bodies and may be obtained from the congregation secretary.</span><span class="font10"> Before your visit, please review the June 2002 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.</span></p>

The packet should be requested by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">body of elders only</span><span class="font10"> in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of April 22,1991, page 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter. The completed S-82 forms in the congregation file should be made available for the circuit overseer’s review when he visits the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Memorial observance this year falls on Sunday, April 4. The elders should give attention to the following matters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location of the observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready. —See the February 15, 2003, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> pages 14-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “The sixth angel blew his trumpet.” Following that, “armies of cavalry” numbering “two myriads of myriads” thunder forth. This is no ordinary military force. “The heads of the horses [are] as heads of lions.” Fire, smoke, and sulfur spew forth from their mouths, and their “tails are like serpents.” This symbolic cavalry charge leaves devastation in its wake. (Rev. 9:13-19) Do you know how you are involved in the fulfillment of this striking prophetic vision?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The anointed remnant and their companions, the other sheep, unitedly make known God’s judgments. This results in the complete exposure of Christendom’s spiritually dead condition.

<p><span class="font11">20) How effective this Biblical method of preaching has proved to be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Billions of Bibles, books, brochures, and magazines have been distributed by Christian ministers in carrying out the divine preaching commission. These publications have been provided in nearly 400 languages, covering a wide variety of subjects and using approaches that appeal to various kinds of people.

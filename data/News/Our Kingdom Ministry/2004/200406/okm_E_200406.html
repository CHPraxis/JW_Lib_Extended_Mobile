<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Helps Those Who Trust Him</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many people view money, power, and human ability as keys to success. (Ps. 12:4; 33:16, 17; 49:6) However, those who fear Jehovah and place their trust in him have the Bible’s assurance that “he is their help and their shield.” (Ps. 115:11) Let us consider two areas in which we need to demonstrate trust in Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> As Christian Ministers: </span><span class="font9">Whenever we handle assignments in the congregation or teach in the field ministry, we must rely on our God. Consider Jesus’ example. Although he was God’s Son, he did not trust in his own wisdom or ability but relied completely on his heavenly Father. (John 12: 49; 14:10) How much more so do we need to do the same! (Prov. 3:5-7) Only with Jehovah’s blessing will our humble efforts honor him and benefit others.—Ps. 127:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> We demonstrate our reliance on Jehovah by praying for his guidance and the help of his holy spirit. (Ps. 105:4; Luke 11:13) In addition, we show our trust in God by basing our teaching on his Word, the Bible. Its message has the power to touch hearts and transform lives. (Heb. 4:12) When we “minister as dependent on the strength that God supplies,” Jehovah is glorified.—1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Dealing With Problems: </span><span class="font9">We also need to look to Jehovah for help when facing pressures and problems. (Ps. 46:1) For example, an employer may hesitate to give us time off to attend an assembly, or we may face a challenging situation in our family life. We show our trust in Jehovah by earnestly petitioning him and applying the guidance that he provides through his Word and organization. (Ps. 62:8; 119:143, 173) By so doing, Jehovah’s servants experience his helping hand in their lives.—Ps. 37:5; 118:13, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah himself assures us: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.” (Jer. 17:7) May we demonstrate our trust in him in all that we do! —Ps. 146:5.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Angels Are Helping Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” How encouraging those words are to all those heeding Jesus’ command: “Go therefore and make disciples”! (Matt. 28:1820) One significant way that Jesus is with true Christians is by means of his angels. (Matt. 13:36-43) How thrilling it is to declare the “everlasting good news” in unison with these faithful spirit creatures!—Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Our Ministry: </span><span class="font9">The Bible reveals that the angels are sent “to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation.” (Heb. 1:14) In the first century, the angels were involved in directing Jesus’ followers to deserving ones. (Acts 8:26) Today, God’s servants continue to see evidence of angelic direction. On many occasions, householders have said that they had been praying for help when a Witness came to their door. How we, along with the angels, rejoice when such ones respond to the Kingdom message!—Luke 15:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Facing Opposition: </span><span class="font9">Daniel, his three young Hebrew companions, the apostle Peter, and many others who have undergone great tests have experienced Jehovah’s protection by means of angels, “mighty in power.” (Ps. 103:20; Dan. 3:28; 6:21, 22; Acts 12:11) Although at times we may feel helpless in the face of opposition, we can be encouraged by the experience of Elisha’s attendant when he learned that “there are more who are with us than those who are with them.” (2 Ki. 6:15-17) Even if we are forcibly separated from our Christian brothers, we need not despair. God’s Word assures us: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him.”—Ps. 34:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Soon angelic armies will ride forth to remove all opposition to Christ’s kingship. (Rev. 19:11, 14, 15) While we await that day, may we continue boldly praising Jehovah, fully confident of the powerful support of heavenly armies under Christ’s command.—1 Pet. 3:22.</span></p>

What does it mean to be reasonable? Why is it important in our ministry? What can we learn from the apostle Paul’s example? How can publishers take into consideration the background of people in the local territory? How can we help Bible students to display reasonableness? Arrange in advance for one or two to relate experiences that show the benefits of a reasonable approach.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In 1895, study groups of the Bible Students, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called, came to be known as Dawn Circles for Bible Study. Volumes of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Millennial Dawn</span><span class="font9"> were used as the basis for study. Later, these meetings were called Berean Circles for Bible Study. (Acts 17: 11) Often a group of moderate size met in a private home on an evening convenient to the group. These meetings were the forerunners of the Congregation Book Study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Encouragement and Assistance: </span><span class="font9">Since book study groups are purposely kept small, there is greater opportunity for those in attendance to make expressions of their faith. The result is “an interchange of encouragement ..., each one through the other’s faith.”—Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Observing the book study overseer’s manner of teaching can help us to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) Take note of how he emphasizes the Scriptural basis of the material. If appropriate for the publication being considered, he may highlight key points by means of a concluding review, using just the Bible. His good example can help us to improve our teaching in the Christian ministry. —1 Cor. 11:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In addition to conducting the weekly lesson, the book study overseer takes the lead in evangelizing. In cooperation</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">1. What were the early beginnings of the Congregation Book Study arrangement?</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">3, 4. How does the book study arrangement help us to accomplish our ministry? with the service overseer, he makes practical arrangements for field service. He seeks to assist all in the group to fulfill their Christian responsibility to preach the good news and make disciples.—Matt. 28:19,20; 1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The book study overseer is Interested in the spiritual welfare of each one in the group. He demonstrates this interest at congregation meetings and as he works with others in field service. He also uses occasions when he visits the brothers in their homes to share a spiritual gift. All should feel welcome to approach the book study overseer for spiritual assistance whenever they have a need.—Isa. 32:1, 2.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Strengthen One Another: </span><span class="font9">In lands where the activity of God’s people is restricted, the brothers often meet in smaller groups. One brother recalled: “Even though our Christian activities were banned, whenever possible we held our weekly meetings in groups of between 10 and 15. From the meetings we derived spiritual strength, from both our Bible study and our association after the study. We would compare our experiences, and this helped us to realize that each of us had the same struggle.” (1 Pet. 5:9) May we, likewise, strengthen one another by fully supporting the Congregation Book Study arrangement.—Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Jehovah’s Justice</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah is a lover of justice.” (Ps. 37:28) Thus, although he has decreed that this unrighteous world be destroyed, he has arranged for a warning to be sounded first. (Mark 13:10) This affords people the opportunity to repent and be saved. (2 Pet. 3:9) Do we strive to imitate Jehovah’s justice? Does the misery and suffering of the human family move us to share the Kingdom hope with others? (Prov. 3:27) Love of justice will impel us to have an active share in preaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preach With Impartiality: </span><span class="font10">By declaring God’s purpose to everyone without partiality, we “exercise justice.” (Mic. 6:8) We must resist the imperfect inclination to prejudge others based on their outward appearance. (Jas. 2:1-4, 9) Jehovah’s “will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) God’s word of truth can cause remarkable changes in the lives of people. (Heb. 4: 12) Appreciating this fact can move us to approach individuals with confidence, even those who may have turned a deaf ear in the past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> One sister working in a store was somewhat frightened by the physical appearance of a regular customer. Nevertheless, when the appropriate occasion arose, she tried to witness to him about God’s promised Paradise. He brusquely replied that he did not believe in fairy tales and that he was a hippie and drug addict. But she did not give up. One day he asked her what she thought about his long hair, so she tactfully explained what the Bible says on the matter. (1 Cor. 11:14) To her pleasant surprise, the next day he was cleanshaven and had short hair! He asked for a Bible study, which a brother was happy to conduct, and progressed to dedication and baptism. Like this man, many who are serving Jehovah today are grateful for the impartial, persistent efforts of those who brought them the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah will soon wipe unrighteousness from the face of the earth. (2 Pet. 3:10,13) In the limited time remaining, may we imitate Jehovah’s justice by giving all an opportunity to escape the coming destruction of Satan’s unrighteous world. —1 John 2:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1: What Is a Bible Study?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Worldwide, about six million Bible studies are being conducted by God’s people each month. By using good teaching methods, we can help these Bible students progress to the point of dedication and baptism and become “adequately qualified to teach others.” (2 Tim. 2:2) Would you like to help your student to make such progress? Starting with this issue, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">will feature a series of articles that will explain basic aspects of conducting progressive Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> When to Report a Bible Study: </span><span class="font10">If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible along with one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. This is true even if the study takes place on the doorstep or over the telephone. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book are publications used for conducting many Bible studies. After they have been completed, if it is evident that a person is making progress, even slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then the study may be continued in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font10"> book. The brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Be God’s Friend!</span><span class="font10"> may be used to study with people who have limited education or reading ability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The Bible study work has been effective in assisting millions to become true disciples of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By applying the suggestions offered in upcoming articles of this series, you can conduct a progressive Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>

Talk and discussion based on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font10"> book, page 254, paragraphs 1-2. When we explain and apply scriptures in the field ministry and from the platform, our teaching will be more effective if we give reasons for what we say instead of simply asserting that it is so. Using examples from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book or others that are appropriate for the local territory, show how to (1) isolate and explain key expressions in a scripture text, (2) present supporting evidence from the context or from another scripture that deals with the subject, (3) use an illustration to show the reasonableness of what you have said, and (4) use questions to help the listeners reason on the matter.

<p><span class="font9">■ Since October will have five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “Facing the Future With Faith and Courage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Regular Pioneer Service</span><span class="font9"> (S-205) and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service </span><span class="font9">(S-205b).

Maintain at least a one-year supply. ■ Before submitting applications for regular pioneer service to the branch office, the congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation’s Publisher Record</span><span class="font9"> card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Because of the transfer of printing operations to Wallkill, New York, and the sale of the 360 Furman Street building, the following tour changes will take effect at the branch facilities in Brooklyn, New York. Tours of 117 Adams Street will be suspended on July 31, 2004, until further notice. Tours of 360 Furman Street will be discontinued as of October 6, 2004.

<p><span class="font10">Since the subscription arrangement for both the printed and audiocassette editions of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">in all languages was discontinued some time ago, all publishers should obtain their magazines, audiocassettes, and MP3 CD’s through the local congregation. The exception would be Braille magazines and audiocassettes that are mailed as free matter for those who qualify. Please note that congregations may request magazines on audiocassette or MP3 CD’s on a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation Requests</span><span class="font10"> (M-202) form. Foreign-language and large-print editions should likewise be requested using this form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If someone in your territory requests regular magazine delivery, please be sure to follow through promptly so that not even one issue is missed. Disfellowshipped persons may obtain the magazines or other literature for their personal use at the magazine and literature counter at the Kingdom Hall. Disfellowshipped persons should </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font10"> be included on a personal magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only subscriptions that the United States branch will maintain on file are for those who cannot be served by a congregation publisher through a magazine route. If the Congregation Service Committee submits a request for subscriptions for someone who cannot otherwise obtain them, the secretary should include a brief note verifying that this subscription request has been reviewed and approved by the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This means that publishers should not write to the branch office to request personal subscriptions. Any such requests for subscriptions made by publishers or by interested persons will be referred back to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ How can a prison inmate obtain personal copies of the magazines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the congregation caring for the preaching work at a penal institution can supply the magazines to inmates confined there, then an inmate should obtain his personal copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines through the visiting publishers. When this is not possible, the inmate may personally request subscriptions by writing to the branch office. Please note that disfellowshipped inmates may likewise obtain personal copies of the magazines as outlined in this paragraph.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Preach in Business Territory</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Would you like to preach in territory where people generally welcome visitors and where not-at-homes are rare? You may be able to do so right in your congregation territory. How? By calling on the businesses found there. Publishers witnessing from store to store often enjoy good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some congregations have business districts as part of their assigned territory. The brother caring for the territory may prepare special map cards of these heavily concentrated business sections. Any residential territory map cards that overlap them should clearly indicate that the businesses are not to be worked as part of the territory. In other territories, businesses can be worked along with the residences. If you have never done business witnessing, start by trying a few smaller stores.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Use a Simple Approach: </span><span class="font10">When witnessing from store to store, it is important to dress as you would for a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. It is also good to choose a time when the store is not busy. If possible, enter when there are no customers waiting to be served. Ask to speak to the manager or the person in charge. Be brief and to the point. What might you say?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When speaking with a store-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">1. What are some advantages of witnessing in business territory? 2. How can business witnessing be organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">3. What will help us to be effective when witnessing from store to store?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">4-6. What can we say when witnessing to a storekeeper or manager?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">keeper or manager, you might say something like this: “Business people have such full schedules that we rarely find them at home, so we are visiting you at your workplace. Our magazines give a global perspective on current events.” Then feature one brief point from one magazine.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Or you might try this simple approach: “Many people would like to know more about the Bible but have very little time. This tract explains a free study program that is available to help you find answers to your Bible questions.” Then point out pages 4-5 of the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If the person in charge seems to be busy, you might just offer a tract and say: “I will stop by again when you are not so busy. I would like to know what you think of this tract.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Cultivating Interest Shown: </span><span class="font10">You may even be able to conduct a Bible study in business territory. A special pioneer regularly delivered the magazines to a businessman. When the man expressed appreciation for what he was reading, the pioneer demonstrated the Bible study arrangement, using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure. A study was established right there at the man’s place of work. Taking into account the circumstances, the pioneer limited it to 10 or 15 minutes each time. May we, likewise, continue to search for deserving ones by witnessing in business territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">7. How can we cultivate the interest we find in business territory?</span></p>

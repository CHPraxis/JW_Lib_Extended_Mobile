<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">January 2004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 1/04 Vol. 47, No. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Like the early Christians, we today regularly come together at assemblies where “quite a crowd” has gathered. (Acts 11: 26) Since 1965, we have been using Assembly Halls for assemblies and conventions where suitable rented facilities are not available. Presently, there are 40 Assembly Halls in the United States branch. A new one is near completion in California, and plans are progressing for another in Georgia. More are needed, and arrangements for these are under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During these difficult economic times, the cost of Assembly Hall construction and operation is constantly rising. Thus, the Governing Body has ‘calculated the expense’ and directed that a standard Assembly Hall design be developed. (Luke 14:28) The aim is to build modest-sized halls that utilize simpler, less costly finishings. This will allow projects to move along more quickly with volunteer help. At the same time, efforts will be made to ensure that the buildings are practical, comfortable, and attractive in appearance. Our prayer is that standardizing Assembly Hall design will save money, time, and labor, allowing us to give more attention to the all-important preaching work. —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is a pleasure for us to be working together with you in Jehovah’s service. We send our warm Christian love to all of you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Excelling Value of Divine Wisdom</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some people think that Jehovah’s Witnesses should focus their efforts more directly on helping to alleviate the problems facing mankind today. Such persons fail to see the excelling value of our Bible educational work. It is as the apostle Paul wrote: “The speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is God’s power.” (1 Cor. 1:18) Indeed, we know that the Christian ministry is the most important work being done on earth today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Better Life Now: </span><span class="font11">Human efforts to solve mankind’s problems have yielded very limited results. Legislation has not stopped the proliferation of crime. Peace treaties and peacekeeping forces have not brought an end to war. Social programs have failed to eradicate poverty. (Ps. 146:3, 4; Jer. 8:9) In contrast, the Kingdom message has transformed the lives of millions by helping them to put on a new personality that is acceptable to God. (Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:9, 10) In so doing, they enjoy an im-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. How do many people view the Christian ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. (a) What has been the fruitage of human efforts to solve mankind’s problems? (b) What results has the Kingdompreaching and disciple-making work produced? proved quality of life right now.—1 Tim. 4:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Bright Future: </span><span class="font11">In addition to helping us meet the immediate challenges of life, divine wisdom enables us to plan effectively for the future. (Ps. 119:105) It spares us the futility of trying to reform the present system of things. (Eccl. 1:15; Rom. 8:20) How grateful we are that we are not squandering our lives in pursuit of goals that are only an illusion! Rather, we center our efforts on Jehovah’s sure promise of “new heavens and a new earth” in which righteousness will dwell. When Jehovah’s day of judgment arrives, it will be unmistakably clear that those who relied on divine wisdom made the right choice.—2 Pet. 3:10-13; Ps. 37:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Although divine wisdom may seem impractical to those steeped in “the wisdom of this system of things,” it is in reality the only practical course to follow. (1 Cor. 1:21; 2:6-8) Hence, we continue to proclaim throughout the earth the message that originates with God, who is “wise alone.”—Rom. 16:27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">4. What might you say to help people in your territory see the excelling value of the wisdom contained in God’s Word?</span></p>

Like Jesus, Paul took advantage of opportunities to witness to “those who happened to be on hand.” (Acts 17:17) What opportunities are there to do this in our territory? Who are “on hand” when we go shopping, are at work or school, or take public transportation? Whom might we come in contact with when at home? Invite audience to relate experiences that they have had in witnessing to people they met during everyday activities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 7, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Whose Values Do You Cherish?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Sunday, April 4, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font11"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that day, appropriate adjustments should be made for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study to be conducted at another time. Circuit overseers will need to adjust their meeting schedule for the week according to local circumstances. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">■ How can we ensure proper timing of congregation meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Time moves swiftly when we are sharing something good with friends. For this reason, it can be a challenge to handle meeting parts within the allotted time. What can help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Start on time.</span><span class="font11"> When the entire congregation meets, it may be helpful to invite the audience to take their seats a minute or two beforehand so that the meeting can begin at the designated time in an orderly way. (Eccl. 3:1) Meetings involving smaller groups, such as meetings for held service, should not be delayed to wait for those who may arrive late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Prepare thoroughly.</span><span class="font11"> A key to good timing is advance preparation. Get the objective of the assignment clearly in mind. Identify the main points, and make these stand out. Avoid getting sidetracked by minor details. Keep the presentation simple. If the part includes demonstrations or interviews, rehearse them in advance. To the extent possible, time your part while practicing it out loud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Apportion your material. </span><span class="font11">Whether your assignment is a talk or an audience discussion, you may find it helpful to divide the material into sections. Decide how much time to spend on each section, and indicate this in the margin of your notes. Then monitor your timing during the presentation. In an audience discussion, avoid the pitfall of entertaining so many comments in the introductory portion that you have to rush through weightier material that appears later. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study conductors should allow sufficient time to consider the review box at the end. They should also be careful not to infringe on the time allotted for the concluding song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Conclude on time.</span><span class="font11"> If a meeting consists of several parts, such as the Service Meeting, each speaker should be conscious of when his part is to begin and end. What can be done if the meeting is running behind schedule? One or more of the brothers may be able to make up the time by focusing on main points and eliminating some details. The ability to do this is one mark of a skilled teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As an audience, we can assist the brother conducting by keeping our expressions brief and to the point. All of us, therefore, can contribute to meetings that take place “decently and by arrangement.” —1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In this age of time- and labor-saving devices, many find themselves with seemingly more things to do and less time in which to do them. Do you find it challenging to maintain a good spiritual routine? Do you wish you had more time for the ministry? How can we make the best use of our time?—Ps. 90:12; Phil. 1:9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Identify Time Wasters: </span><span class="font11">All of us should periodically examine how we use our time. The Bible urges: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” (Eph. 5:15, 16) Consider the challenges presented by advances in information technology. While computers and other electronic devices have legitimate uses, they can become a snare if we fail to keep strict watch on our use of time. —1 Cor. 7:29, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Each of us should ask himself: ‘Do I spend time each day reading or answering E-mail messages that are little more than an annoyance? Am I often engaged in making telephone calls or sending text messages about trivial matters? (1 Tim. 5:13) Do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font11"> find myself browsing the Internet without any purpose or aimlessly switching from channel to channel when watching television? Has a preoccupation with electronic games begun to infringe on my study of God’s Word?’ Such pursuits can subtly rob us of our spirituality.—Prov. 12:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Using Time Wisely: </span><span class="font11">Electronic devices tend to commandeer both our time and our attention. A youth who was heavily into computer games admitted: “Sometimes when I had played before going out in the ministry or to a Christian meeting, I found it very difficult to concentrate. I was almost always thinking about how I would solve a certain game problem after getting home. My personal study and regular Bible reading suffered. My joy in serving God began to decline.” Recognizing that he needed to make changes, he deleted all his computer games. “That was really tough,” he recalls. “I was more attached to games than I had thought. But I also experienced a great feeling of victory because I knew that I had done it for my own good.”—Matt. 5: 29, 30.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It may be necessary to take such measures if there are areas in which you need to make adjustments. Could you buy out a half hour each day from nonessential activities? That is about how much time it would take to read the entire Bible in one year. How spiritually rewarding that would be! (Ps. 19:7-11; 119:97-100) Set definite times for Bible reading, meeting preparation, and the field ministry. (1 Cor. 15:58) Doing this will help you to keep time wasters in check and will help you to “go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” —Eph. 5:17.</span></p></li></ul>

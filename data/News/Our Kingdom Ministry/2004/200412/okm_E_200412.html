<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Help Is Needed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “Thank you for all you do in behalf of all of us. It really makes a difference.” That comment weh expresses the gratitude we feel for our elders and ministerial servants. As God’s organization continues to expand, there is an ongoing need for mature men to serve in the nearly 100,000 congregations worldwide. If you are a baptized brother, your help is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> “Reaching Out”: </span><span class="font0">How can you reach out for additional service privileges? (1 Tim. 3:1) Basically, by setting a fine example in all aspects of your life. (1 Tim. 4: 12; Titus 2:6-8; 1 Pet. 5:3) Have a full share in the preaching work, and assist others to do likewise. (2 Tim. 4:5) Take a sincere interest in the welfare of fellow believers. (Rom. 12:13) Be a good student of God’s Word, and develop the “art of teaching.” (Titus 1:9; 1 Tim. 4:13) Diligently care for the assignments entrusted to you by the elders. (1 Tim. 3:10) If you are a family head, ‘preside over your household in a fine manner.’—1 Tim. 3:4, 5,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Serving in an appointed capacity involves hard work and requires a spirit of self-sacrifice. (1 Tim. 5:17) Therefore, in reaching out, focus on humbly serving others. (Matt. 20:25-28; John 13: 3-5, 12-17) Meditate on the disposition of Timothy, and seek to imitate it. (Phil. 2:20-22) Like him, let your fine conduct recommend you. (Acts 16:1, 2) As you cultivate the spiritual qualities needed to handle added privileges and apply any counsel for improvement that you receive, “your advancement [will] be manifest to all persons.” —1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Parents, Train Young Ones to Help: </span><span class="font0">Children can begin learning to help from an early age. Train them to pay attention at meetings, to preach, and to be exemplary in conduct at the Kingdom Hall and at school. Get them involved in serving others, doing things such as assisting with Kingdom Hall cleaning, helping the elderly, and so forth. Allow them to experience the happiness that comes from giving. (Acts 20:35) Such training can help them to become the pioneers, the ministerial servants, and the elders of tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 4: Training Students to Prepare</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words should make rapid spiritual progress. Therefore, once a regular study has been established, prepare a lesson together to show the student how. With most students, it will be helpful to prepare an entire chapter or lesson together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Markings and Notations: </span><span class="font0">Explain how to find direct answers to the printed questions. Show the student your copy of the study publication in which you have marked only the key words or phrases. As you consider the material, he may want to follow your example, marking in his copy only what is needed to help him recall the answer. (Luke 6:40) Then ask him to give the answer in his own words. This will allow you to see how well he understands the material.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> A careful examination of unquoted scriptures is an important part of the student’s preparation for the study. (Acts 17:11) Help him to see that each cited text supports a point in the paragraph. Show him how to make brief notations in the margin of his study publication. Keep before him the fact that the Bible is the basis for what he is learning. Encourage him to make generous use of the cited scriptures in his comments during the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Survey and Review: </span><span class="font0">Before the student begins his detailed preparation of the study material, it will be helpful for him to get an overview of the subject. Point out that he can survey the material by briefly examining the chapter title, subheadings, and illustrations. Explain that before concluding his session of preparation, he would be wise to take a moment to review the main points presented in the lesson, perhaps using the review box if one is provided. Such repetition will help him retain the information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Training the student to prepare well for his study will help him to make meaningful comments at congregation meetings. It will also help him to develop study habits that will benefit him long after his personal Bible study is completed.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>2005 “Godly Obedience” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">’As our Grand Instructor, Jehovah God arranges for us to assemble to be Instructed in his ways. (Isa. 30:20, 21; 54:13) He does this through the faithful and discreet slave class, which arranges for such meetings as our annual district conventions. (Matt. 24:45-47) Our sentiments are like those of the psalmist David, who sang: “Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (Ps. 26:12) David clearly understood the value of being taught by Jehovah and was determined to be among His people whenever they gathered together.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Will you be among “the congregated throngs” who will attend the “Godly Obedience” District Convention this year? If so, the following information will prove helpful in making your preparations to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Plan Now to Attend Every Day: </span><span class="font1">“The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” (Prov. 21:5) Do not those words emphasize the value of making plans without delay to attend the convention? To ensure that you will not miss any of the spiritually refreshing program, wisely start now to make whatever arrangements are needed for you to attend all three days. If you have to ask your employer for time off, do so right away. If you need to discuss your plans with your unbelieving mate, do not leave this to the last minute. Whatever challenges you face, make them a matter of prayer to Jehovah, trusting that with his help “your plans will be firmly established.” (Prov. 16:3) Additionally, it would be good to assist your Bible students with their preparations to be present at every session.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font0">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. - 5:05 p.m. Sunday 9:30 a.m. - 4:10 p.m.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Accommodations: </span><span class="font1">For your convenience, rooming arrangements have already been made in each convention city. A Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on the information board after this article is considered at the Service Meeting. Please reserve rooms only at hotels on the list, and agree to pay only the rates shown. Your cooperation will make it possible for the branch office to continue to arrange for high-quality hotels at reduced rates. Bear in mind that the best quality hotels are not necessarily the closest to the convention site. Before you call to make your reservation, review the points in the box “How You Can Support the Rooming Arrangements.” When you call, follow the steps in the box “What Is the Best Way to Reserve a Hotel Room?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font1">The apostle Paul described certain brothers as being “a strengthening aid” to him. (Col. 4:7-11) One of the ways they helped was by providing personal services for Paul. How can you be “a strengthening aid” to others in connection with the convention? Elderly publishers, the inflrm, those in full-time service, and others may require practical assistance with transportation or accommodations. Relatives have the primary responsibility to care for such ones. (1 Tim. 5:4) If they cannot do so, however, fellow believers may be able to help. (Jas. 1:27) Book study overseers should check with those in their group who have special needs to be sure that their plans are in order well in advance of the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>How You Can Support the Rooming Arrangements</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■ Stay only in hotels on this year’s Recommended Lodging List. Do not call hotels that are not on the list and ask if they have a rate for our convention. Hotels that are not on the list will often say they have a rate for Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ To comply with fire safety laws, plan on having no more than four persons in each room, including children, unless the list indicates otherwise under the heading “Adults.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ If no rooms are available when you call all the hotels on the list or if you have a problem with a hotel, inform your congregation secretary. He should contact your convention’s Rooming Department, using the information at the top of the list. Please wait for a revised list to be received for your convention rather than calling a hotel not on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ Reserve only the rooms you will actually use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ To guarantee your reservation, you must make a deposit to the hotel for each room reserved. Otherwise, the hotel can offer your room to someone else.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ Keep your first reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">■ If your congregation has its circuit assembly the week that the convention assignment letter is to be read, the secretary may make a copy of the Recommended Lodging List for each book study overseer to show to his group. No copies of the list are to be made for individual publishers.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Special Needs Room Request</span><span class="font1"> forms are available </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font1"> for publishers whose accommodation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">needs</span><span class="font1"> cannot be cared for by family members or by their congregation. The Congregation Service Committee should consider the publisher’s qualifications, using the guidelines on the form as well as the letter dated December 14, 2004, addressed to all bodies of elders. This provision is only for publishers in good standing, along with their well-behaved children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font1">To ensure that there is sufficient seating, literature, rooming accommodations, and so forth, publishers are encouraged to attend the convention to which their congregation is assigned. If circumstances require that you attend a different convention, please see your congregation secretary for the mailing address of the convention you will attend, which is printed on the back of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Needs Room Request</span><span class="font1"> form. Be sure to include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request for the Recommended Lodging List or any additional information. If there is more than one convention being held in the city, indicate the dates of the convention that you will attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Volunteers Needed: </span><span class="font1">Jesus set a perfect example in being humbly attentive to the needs of others. (Luke 9:12-17; John 13:5, 14-16) Those who volunteer to work at conventions reflect a similar spirit. To fill the needs of convention departments, local Convention Committees will soon be inviting others to work with them. There is especially a need for elders to volunteer and accept assignments. Their willing spirit provides a fine example for all in the congregation.—1 Pet. 5:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>What Is the Best Way to Reserve a Hotel Room?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Call hotels during regular business hours, using the telephone numbers on the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Inform the hotel that you are attending the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. Specify the dates you will check in and check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. If no more rooms are available, call another hotel on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Do</span><span class="font6"> not accept a higher rate than what is shown on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. Make your reservation, and ask for a confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">7. Make your deposit by credit card, check, or money order </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">within ten days. Never </span><span class="font6">send cash. If a deposit is made by check or money order, write the confirmation number on the front.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> What Others See: </span><span class="font1">A hotel sales manager said: “You people are our very favorite group. You are so well behaved compared with any other group. The maids all comment on how nicely they are treated and how they receive tips. In fact, everyone wants to work the weekend you are here!” Another hotel representative commented: “Jehovah’s Witnesses are the easiest group to work with.” Perhaps your exemplary conduct contributed to these statements. Imagine how happy Jehovah must feel when he sees us acting in a way that brings such praise! —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> Through “the faithful steward,” Jehovah God has arranged for his people to assemble for spiritual instruction this coming summer. (Luke 12:42) Making preparations to attend all three days will require effort but will be well worth it. This year’s “Godly Obedience” District Convention will without fail strengthen our resolve to serve Jehovah now and on into eternity. May we be determined to follow the psalmist’s admonition: “In congregated throngs bless God.”—Ps. 68:26.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How the Theocratic Ministry School Benefits Us</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people have the distinct privilege of receiving theocratic education. (Isa. 54: 13; John 6:45) The extent to which we benefit from it, however, depends largely on the effort we exert. Can you discern the positive effects the Theocratic Ministry School is having on your spirituality?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Appreciative Comments: </span><span class="font0">Many school overseers have noted that the in-depth study of speech qualities has improved their congregations’ effectiveness in the field ministry. In addition, one school overseer has found that as a result of the provision for audience participation in Bible highlights, more are keeping to the schedule of Bible reading. Concerning Assignment No. 2, many brothers have commented favorably on the benefits of focusing on the material without preparing an introduction and conclusion. Those assigned this part are now concentrating more attentively on improving their reading skills.—1 Tim. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> All Can Benefit: </span><span class="font0">Commenting at meetings can be a delight. (Prov. 15:23) Having the oral review questions in advance enables us to prepare for and participate in the review readily. Additionally, with the January 1,2004, issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font0"> highlights from Bible books have appeared that correspond with our assigned reading in the Theocratic Ministry School. These articles have helped many to make upbuilding comments during Bible highlights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Everyone enrolled in the school has the special privilege of preparing and delivering assignments. All of us can benefit from the school overseer’s positive comments from the platform. Individual students profit further from points of counsel that he may offer in private after the meeting. The exercises featuring speech qualities at the end of each chapter of the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education</span><span class="font0"> provide additional help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> As practical and Scriptural ideas are brought to your attention during and after the school, make note of these in your copy of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font0"> textbook. Reflect on what you have learned, and consider how this aspect of divine education is enhancing your spirituality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">How well-informed are you about the options that are available in the field of bloodless medicine? Do you understand what some of the transfusion alternatives are and how they work? Watch this video, and test your knowledge with the following questions.—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in deciding whether their young children should see it.</span></p>

However, the articles will no doubt be of interest to doctors themselves, since the series addresses why some physicians have been attracted to the Bible’s message of hope. You may wish to order extra copies and make a special effort to give a copy to your doctor as well as to other health care professionals. Congregations should notify the branch at once of any increased orders for this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ The Memorial invitations for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2005 </span><span class="font12">in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent to the congregation.

A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month.

<p><span class="font12">■ Please note that the Memorial for the year </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2006 </span><span class="font12">will be on Wednesday, April 12, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found.

<p><span class="font12">■ Because of the importance of the Memorial, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the speaker Instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year.

<p><span class="font0">The Governing Body has approved combining the essential elements of the durable power of attorney (DPA) document and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Advance Medical Directive/Release</span><span class="font0"> card into a single legal document, which we shall refer to generally as a DPA card. A DPA card has been prepared for each state. The actual title of the DPA card varies from state to state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will need to All out the DPA card for your state of residence only. The DPA card is valid indefinitely anywhere in the United States and will serve as a statement of your wishes when you travel internationally. In the future, you should fill out a new DPA card if (1) you need to make any changes to your DPA card, such as changing your wishes, health-care agents, addresses, and telephone numbers, or (2) your DPA card has been lost or destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The DPA card should be prayerfully considered and carefully filled out at home. However, before signing the card, it is important that the legal formalities be closely followed. For example, if your card says that two witnesses are required to see you sign, they should be present when you sign it. Book study overseers may periodically check with those who have not filled out new cards to see if assistance is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before folding the DPA card, make good-quality photocopies for your health-care agent, alternate health-care agent, and doctor as well as for your own records. You may also want to provide copies for other family members and the congregation secretary. Copies should be single-sided on standard-size (8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot;) paper, with the DPA card centered on the page. The original DPA card, not a photocopy, should be kept on your person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Identity Card</span><span class="font0"> with the print date of 3/99 for unbaptized children of Witness parents has not changed. Parents should ensure that a card for each minor child is properly filled out and signed and that the child carries it at appropriate times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unbaptized publishers may adapt the language of the DPA card and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Identity Card</span><span class="font0"> in order towrite out health-care instructions for themselves and their children.

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> What greater joy could we have than to enter the new world with our loved ones, united with them in worship of Jehovah! By our witnessing to relatives, this joyful prospect may become reality. To do so in a refreshing manner, however, requires discernment. A circuit overseer observed: “The best results are achieved by those who awaken curiosity in their relatives by witnessing in measured doses.” How might we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Awaken Their Curiosity: </span><span class="font0">Give careful forethought to how you might stir the interest of your relatives. (Prov. 15:28) What are their concerns? What challenges are they facing? Perhaps you could share an article or mention an appealing scripture on a subject that is of special interest to them. If your relatives do not live nearby, perhaps you can do this in a letter or by telephone. Without overwhelming them, sow seeds of truth, and look to Jehovah to make those seeds grow.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Jesus instructed a man from whom he had expelled many demons: “Go home to your relatives, and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he had on you.” (Mark 5:19) Imagine the impression this must have made on his relatives! Although you may not experience anything quite so dramatic, likely your relatives have an inter-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">1. Why is discernment needed when witnessing to relatives?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. How can sincere interest in our relatives help us to awaken their curiosity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. How might the interest that our relatives have in us open the way for a witness? </span><span class="font0">est in your activities or those of your children. Mentioning a talk you had in the Theocratic Ministry School, a convention you attended, a visit to Bethel, or a personal milestone might open the way for you to share with them something further about Jehovah and his organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Discerning: </span><span class="font0">When witnessing to relatives, avoid telling them too much at once. Recalling the time when he began to study the Bible, one brother admitted: “I then showered my mother for hours on end with explanations about almost everything I had learned from the Bible, and this often led to arguments, especially with my father.” Even when a relative expresses interest in the Bible’s message, answer in a way that leaves the person wanting to know more. (Prov. 25:7) Always show respect, kindness, and patience, just as you would when speaking with strangers in the ministry.—Col. 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> At one point, Jesus’ relatives thought he had lost his mind. (Mark 3:21) Later, however, some became believers. (Acts 1:14) If your initial efforts to share the truth with your relatives are not well received, do not give up. Circumstances and attitudes can change. Continue to look for another opportunity to share a point that may awaken their curiosity. You may have the joy of helping them start on the road to everlasting life. —Matt. 7:13, 14.</span></p>

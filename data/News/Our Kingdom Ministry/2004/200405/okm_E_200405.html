<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Your Thankfulness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Although we live in “critical times hard to deal with,” we have many reasons to be thankful to Jehovah. (2 Tim. 3:1) Foremost among these is the precious gift of his Son in our behalf. (John 3:16) Further, while those in false religion are starving spiritually, we enjoy an abundance of spiritual food. (Isa. 65:13) We are part of a worldwide brotherhood and are privileged to share in the thrilling expansion of true worship. (Isa. 2:3, 4; 60:4-10, 22) How can we show our thankfulness to Jehovah for the blessings he showers upon us?—Col. 3: 15,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Joyful, Wholehearted Service: </span><span class="font11">When discussing material giving, the apostle Paul wrote: “God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7) This principle also applies to our service to God. Thankfulness is reflected in our enthusiasm for the truth, our joy at Christian meetings, our zeal in the field ministry, and our cheerfulness in carrying out the divine will. —Ps. 107:21, 22; 119:14; 122:1; Rom. 12:8, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In ancient Israel the Law did not stipulate a specific amount for certain offerings. Each worshiper could show his gratitude by giving “in proportion to the blessing of Jehovah” that he had received. (Deut. 16:16, 17) Similarly today, a grateful heart will impel us to do as much as our circumstances allow in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. The summer months often provide added opportunities to show our thankfulness. Some take advantage of time off from work or school and the longer daylight hours to increase their time spent in field service, even to auxiliary pioneer. Can you expand your ministry this summer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Overflowing With Thanks: </span><span class="font11">A major way we express our thanks to Jehovah is in prayer. (1 Thess. 5:17, 18) God’s Word urges us to be “overflowing with faith in thanksgiving.” (Col. 2:7) Even when we are very busy or are under stress, we should always include thanksgiving in our daily prayers. (Phil. 4:6) Yes, by means of our ministry as well as our prayers, may we “be rich with many expressions of thanks to God.”—2 Cor. 9:12.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Music That Refreshes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">'Singing and music are an integral part of true worship. In ancient Israel, Asaph and his brothers sang: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people. . . . Sing to him, make melody to him, concern yourselves with all his wonderful acts.” (1 Chron. 16:8, 9) Today we raise our voices in song to Jehovah at our weekly congregation meetings. (Eph. 5:19) What a marvelous opportunity this is to give praise to his name!—Ps. 69:30.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Listening to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies,</span><span class="font11"> orchestral arrangements of Kingdom songs, can fill our mind with spiritual thoughts. “As the melodies are played, I hear the words in my mind,” explained one sister. “What a fine way to keep Jehovah in my thoughts while enjoying music!”—Phil. 4:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Occasions to Enjoy Them: </span><span class="font11">Playing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies</span><span class="font11"> at home creates a warm, spiritual atmosphere that contributes to family peace. “We play this [music] over and over in our home and car and never tire of the stirring arrangements,” wrote one family. “Often </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies</span><span class="font11"> have provided the right peaceful mood when getting ready for Christian meetings or when traveling to an assembly.” A sister said: “They’re a real lift to listen to when I’m doing housework—whoever thought I’d be joyful while folding laundry? I plan to play this music when I find my spirits down. The music has such an exhilarating effect! . . . Every song evokes happiness.” Are there occasions when such refreshing music would benefit you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Much of today’s music reflects the world’s spirit. Parents can help their children to cultivate a taste for wholesome music by making good use of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies </span><span class="font11">recordings. Many Bible students and interested people would also be pleased to know about these beautiful spiritual songs, which glorify Jehovah and uplift the spirit.—Ps. 47:1, 2, 6, 7.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>“Widen Out”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In the Christian brotherhood, each of us has a responsibility to contribute to the warmth of the congregation. (1 Pet. 1:22; 2:17) Such warmth is generated when we “widen out” in our tender affections for one another. (2 Cor. 6:12,13) Why is it important to get to know our brothers and sisters well?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Friendships Grow Stronger: </span><span class="font11">As we become better acquainted with fellow believers, we come to appreciate their faith, endurance, and other fine qualities more fully. Their shortcomings seem smaller to us, and the bonds of friendship grow. Knowing one another well, we are in a better position to build up and comfort one another. (1 Thess. 5: 11) We can become “a strengthening aid” to one another to resist the unwholesome influences of Satan’s world. (Col. 4: 11) In view of these pressure-filled last days, how grateful we are to have good friends among Jehovah’s people!—Prov. 18:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Close friends can be a special source of strength and comfort when we face severe trials. (Prov. 17:17) One Christian who struggled with feelings of worthlessness recalls: “There were friends who would say positive things about me to help me overcome the negative thoughts I had.” Such friends are a blessing from Jehovah. —Prov. 27:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Reach Out to Others: </span><span class="font11">How can we widen out in our tender affections for fellow believers? In addition to greeting others at Christian meetings, make an effort to engage them in meaningful conversation. Without prying into their private matters, show personal interest. (Phil. 2:4; 1 Pet. 4:15) Another way to reach out to others is by inviting them over for a meal. (Luke 14:12-14) Or you might arrange to work with them in the field ministry. (Luke 10:1) As we take the initiative to get to know our brothers better, we foster unity in the congregation.—Col. 3:14.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Do we tend to choose our close associates only from among those of our age group or those whose interests are similar to our own? We should not let such factors limit the friendships we cultivate in the congregation. David and Jonathan as well as Ruth and Naomi forged strong bonds of friendship despite differences in age and background. (Ruth 4:15; 1 Sam. 18:1) Can you expand your friendships? Doing so can bring unanticipated blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> By widening out in our tender affections for others, we strengthen one another and promote peace in the congregation. Furthermore, Jehovah himself blesses us for the love we show our brothers. (Ps. 41: 1, 2; Heb. 6:10) Why not make it your goal to get better acquainted with as many as possible?</span></p></li></ul>

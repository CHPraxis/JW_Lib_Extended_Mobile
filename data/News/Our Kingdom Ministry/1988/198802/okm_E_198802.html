<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> A farmer prepares the land and sows the seed, and then what joy and satisfaction he feels when the seed has sprouted! Even though much effort is required on his part, he will joyfully work hard with the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">hope of </span><span class="font14">r</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eaping a One harvest</span><span class="font14">. Jesus likened “t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">he word of God” to seed</span><span class="font14"> that is sown. (Luxe «: 11) Therefore, we will </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">want</span><span class="font14"> to h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ave a full share in sowing Kingdom se</span><span class="font14">ed. thaUs, “t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">he word</span><span class="font14"> of t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">he kingdo</span><span class="font14">m.” with the hope that it will reach persons whose </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">hearts </span><span class="font14">p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rove to be like “th</span><span class="font14">e fine soil&quot; described in Jesus’ illustration.—Matt. 13:19, 23; Luke 8:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Did you have the privilege of placing some of the older books last month, or did you have fine Scriptural discussions with persons in your territory? Ca</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">n you do more to cultivat</span><span class="font14">e </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">their interest</span><span class="font14"> in the Kingdom message? </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Return visits</span><span class="font14"> are an effective </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">way</span><span class="font14"> to care for the interest shown. These can often be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">made wit</span><span class="font14">hin a day. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">or two</span><span class="font14"> of the initial contact.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> During the month of F</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ebruary</span><span class="font14">, we have further opportunities </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">to of</span><span class="font14">f</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">er the older publicatio</span><span class="font14">ns.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Most congregations have publishers who are getting along in years or those who have physical limitations. They may need help getting to meetings or out in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Some have served faithfully for many years, and they desire to continue participating in congregation activities despite their limitations. One sister in her late 80’s said: “I love Jehovah so much that I simply have to share in the service and attend meetings in order to prove this to him.” (1 Cor. 15:58) Do you not agree such ones deserve our help?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Although many of the elderly and infirm find joy in serving their Creator, some do not feel they can contribute much. “At present I feel my service isn’t much, but it is a great joy to serve my Creator,” said a 93-year-old pioneer. After working with her, a circuit overseer said: “She was more of an encouragement to me than I was to her. She more than adds to the pioneer spirit.” Is there something we can do to let such ones know how much we value them? some with opportunity </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">to expand </span><span class="font14">t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">heir service</span><span class="font14">, making return visits, and perhaps starting new studies. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Each year many brothe</span><span class="font14">rs and sisters seize the opportunity to auxiliary pio-neer in </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">March and April.</span><span class="font14"> This year A</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">pril has five Saturdays</span><span class="font14">, a marked advantage for those who may hold full-time secular jobs. Y</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oung publishers</span><span class="font14"> may be able to use the world’s </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Easter holida</span><span class="font14">y period to engage in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In a number of congregations, the e</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ntire body of elde</span><span class="font14">rs, the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ministerial </span><span class="font14">s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ervants, and their wives have set a </span><span class="font14">fi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ne example by auxiliary pioneeriry</span><span class="font14">. Last April </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">one congregatio</span><span class="font14">n h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ad 83 auxiliary a</span><span class="font14">nd 12 regular pioneers. What a source of encouragement for all the congregation! May Jehovah bless your careful planning!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">RETURN VISITS COULD BECOME STUDIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>G</sup> In order t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">p be effective</span><span class="font14"> when making r</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eturn visits,</span><span class="font14"> you will need to have made appropriate n</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">otations</span><span class="font14"> on your house-to-house record. These will help you to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">determine the subjec</span><span class="font14">t t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o discuss when you call hack</span><span class="font14">. Some publishers like to let the h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ouseholde</span><span class="font14">r do </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">most of the talking on the first call </span><span class="font14">and in that way find out what is on ni§&quot; </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">mind a</span><span class="font14">nd what sUbjeCTS afb Of IhtSh-est to him.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> An invitation to join us in field service is often greatly appreciated. If some have difficulty walking, could we take them along in a wheelchair when doing street work? (Prov. 17: 17) Could we take such publishers into territory that has apartments with elevators or residential areas without steps? Could they go with us on return visits or Bible studies? Or are we studying the Bible with someone who would be willing to go to the elderly person’s home for the study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Is there anything we can do to help those confined to their home to have a meaningful share in field service? What about suggesting that they make use of the telephone? (See November 1985 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font14"> pages 5-6.) Perhaps we could also provide names and addresses of people who live in restricted areas, those not at home, or interested persons to whom letters may be written. One infirm pioneer wrote: “I am very crippled with arthritis all over my body and am not able to walk. But... I can still talk, write, phone, and send out </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GETTING TO MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Ephesians 4:25 says: “We are members belonging to one another.” We therefore want to help our older and infirm brothers to get to meetings. (Phil. 2:4) How can this be done? If some are fearful about driving after dark, can we pick them up in our car? Others may be able to use public transportation or even walk as long as they have someone to accompany them. Could you help in this way?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Some older ones who are housebound have benefited from the meetings by telephone. For others, the meetings have been recorded and then played for them at another time. One sister was asked to visit an incapacitated sister each week to review the main points of the meetings. “I spend a few minutes bringing her up-to-date with announcements and happenings in the congregation. I also take the current Theocratic Ministry School review paper. We thoroughly enjoy this time together. It enables her to keep up with the congregation even though she is absent.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INCLUDE THEM IN OUR SCHEDULE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Can you take the initiative to offer assistance to older brothers and sisters? Look for ways to be of help. Offer yourself willingly. Are there other ways that you can help, such as by shopping for them or taking them to appointments? Our older brothers and sisters will be most appreciative for our concern and loving assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Helping the elderly and infirm can prove to be very enriching. Older ones have experienced much in life and have often learned to live with difficult circumstances; thus, their views and recollections can be of great value to us. (Prov. 16:31) Enjoy the pleasure and personal benefit of helping the elderly and the infirm. —Acts 20:35; Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using the Bible</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “The word of God is alive and exerts power.” (Heb. 4:12) To exert its power to the full and come alive, it must be read and applied. To accomplish this further, Jehovah’s organization, beginning principally in 1954, encouraged us to use the Bible in our door-to-door ministry. We were trained to give three- to eightminute sermons in house-to-house visitations and to bring to the attention of the householders what the Bible has to say on important subjects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In more recent years, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> has regularly carried the Topic for Conversation, outlining two or three scriptures on a subject to use in the field service. For example, currently the Topic for Conversation is on the theme “Religion That Has Real Value.” The scriptures to be used highlight the difference between false and true religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> To use the Bible effectively takes practice and the desire to assist people to realize that it is indeed God’s Word and is alive and powerful. While we are encouraged to use short, to-the-point presentations in magazine-day activity, we do not want to become neglectful in the matter of using the Bible in other features of the field ministry. After all, we are students of the Bible, and what better way is there to give evidence that we are such than by endeavoring to show people from the Word of God itself what Jehovah has in store for mankind and this earth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP FROM THE </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">REASONING</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In addition to the Topic for Conversation in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font14">we have the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span><span class="font14"> As you review the introductions listed on pages 9-15, you will find references to Bible verses that can be used in introducing the Kingdom message. We have a great variety of ways in which to go to the Bible to show people what it has to say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> For example, if some householders are concerned about the elderly, it may be helpful to follow what is suggested in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book on page 14 under the subject “Old Age/ Death.” How appropriate the question would be: “Have you ever wondered why we grow old and die? I would like to point out to you what an inspired Bible writer said at Romans 5:12.” Then you could say: “But while the Bible points out why we grow old and die, it also offers us a most wonderful hope for the future, as found in Revelation 21: 3, 4.” The current literature offer could then be featured.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> So often these days people say, “No, I’m busy.” Many truly are, and we must appreciate that this may be so in their case. Even then, if the circumstances are right, you could say: “I know the feeling, for these are very busy times. I would like to leave you with just this one thought, however,” and turn to one of the scriptures in our current Topic for Conversation. After reading it, you could quickly state what literature you are offering, leave an appropriate tract, or say you will be in the area again soon and will drop by to share some further information about the interesting possibility of living without dying.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> How good it is when people see that we are students of the Bible, adept at using God’s Word in our ministry! It helps them to identify the people today who rely on God’s Word and use it in their daily lives. So, apart from magazine day, be prepared to use the Bible when making the regular literature offer. Our efforts to use the Bible will bring Jehovah’s blessing on our ministry and highlight in the minds of many that God’s Word is indeed alive, exerts power, and can affect their lives.</span></p></li></ul>

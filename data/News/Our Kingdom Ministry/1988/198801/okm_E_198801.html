<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">John 4:23—Religion that God approves.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sowing Kingdom Seed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Psalm 126:6 speaks of sowing literal seed and says: “The one that without fail goes forth,... carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” At Ecclesiastes 11:6 the sower of seed is encouraged with the words: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When we share in the field ministry we, too, in effect carry a bagful of seed but of a spiritual kind. The effectiveness of our sowing spiritual seed is enhanced by literature that features the Kingdom good news. This literature discusses subjects of concern to many persons and shows how vital it is for them to learn about the Kingdom good news. Jehovah, through the faithful slave, has provided us with a fine supply of Bible literature to use in the work of sowing Kingdom seed during this time of the end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In our field ministry during January, we will be featuring some of the older publications that have proved to be effective in helping people to grow spiritually, including </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, Commentary on James,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping New Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah continues to bless his people by bringing in “the desirable things of all the nations.” (Hag. 2:7) Thus, many new ones are joining with us in true worship. Last service year saw an increase of over 45,000 new publishers in the United States. While we rejoice to see this increase, it is now our desire to help these become more effective “fishers of men” as they share with us in publishing the good news.—Mark 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When can a Bible student be invited to join us in the field service? Before identifying himself publicly with Jehovah’s Witnesses, he must first meet the Scriptural and organizational requirements stated in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book on pages 98 and 99. The questions provided there will help you to determine whether the Bible student meets these requirements. If he qualifies, he may be invited to share in the public preaching work and report his field activity to the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> New publishers may have zeal and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Eternal Purpose,” Evolution</span><span class="font10"> (old edition), </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Good News, Holy Spirit, Peace and Security</span><span class="font10"> (old edition), </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">This Life, Truth,</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World Government.</span><span class="font10"> You may offer any two of these publications for $1.00. Some may find it beneficial to offer four or more of these publications to those they meet in their ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARATION ESSENTIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Take a few minutes to review the contents of the older publications that are available to you for field service. You will find that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">This Life </span><span class="font10">discusses such subjects as “Can You Talk with the Dead?” “How Did Old Age and Death Come About?” and “Why Many Now Living Have Opportunity Never to Die.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Some may appreciate having a verse-by-verse commentary on the book of James, and this is available in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on James.</span><span class="font10"> In offering the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font10"> book, you may find it effective to read the statement from the publishers on page 2: “Many sincere persons would like to find a way of life that brings peace and contentment now and assures the enjoyment of a secure future. This book has been published in the hope that it will aid honest-hearted ones to identify the truly superior </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font10"> 3) enthusiasm but lack experience. Perhaps you can help them to begin having a part in the house-to-house work by offering a tract or the magazines, or you may ask them to read a scripture. Commend them for their effort and eagerness to share. Remind them of the apostle Paul’s encouragement for all to “press on to maturity.” (Heb. 6:1) Help them to do this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MAKING PROGRESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Just as children learn to walk by taking one step at a time, new publishers can be helped to make progress step-by-step. If you are training a new publisher, could you progressively help him to give the introduction at the door, to use the Topic for Conversation, and to present the regular literature offer? Is he ready now to begin referring to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book, using questions to draw the householder into the conversation or to lay the basis for an effective return visit and eventual Bible study?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Although the term “justice” has legal associations, basically justice is closely linked to righteousness. The Supreme Judge and Statute-Giver, Jehovah God, “is a lover of righteousness and justice.” (Ps. 33:5) This guarantees that he will </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">never abandon his l</span><span class="font12">oyal </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ones</span><span class="font12"> but will impartially accept all those fearing him and practicing righteousness and bestow his blessing on them. Since Jehovah’s wisdom is far superior to that of imperfect humans, man must humble himself to learn “the path of justice.” (Isa. 40:14) He must learn </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">to conform his thinking</span><span class="font12"> to the standard of justice that Jehovah, the Creator, has revealed in his Word. Jehovah has always rightly required that those seeking his approval acquaint themselves wi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">th his standard of justice and follow it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">'—^Since j</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ustice</span><span class="font12"> is a divine quality, loyal </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Witnesses will want always to exercise it </span><span class="font12">in balance with other Christian virtues, even as </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Micah j</span><span class="font12">6; 8 admonishes ^“[Jehovah] has told you, O earthling man, what is good.

Would you like to learn more about Jehovah’s standard of justice and how we all may conform to it so as to receive his smile of approval? To help us do this, arrangements have been made for many four-day “Divine Justice” District Conventions in the United States branch territory. Undoubtedly your eff</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">orts to atten</span><span class="font12">d and be instructed in divine justice will be </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">richly rewarded</span><span class="font12">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font12">As soon as your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses of the motels, their agreed-upon rates, and the phone numbers, you should I</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">MMEDIATELY phone </span><span class="font12">the motel of your choice, i</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">dentify y</span><span class="font12">our</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">self as one</span><span class="font12"> of Jeho</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">vah’s Witnesses!</span><span class="font12"> and as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention, and make reservations. Doing so will qualify you for the rates listed, which in </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">most cases have been </span><span class="font12">g</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">reatly r</span><span class="font12">educed since the convention has negotiated for a large number of rooms. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">One night’s DEPOSIT</span><span class="font12"> will be</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">you do not intend to use. (Matt. 5:37) </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED</span><span class="font12"> TO HOLD THE ROOMS OREXTEND THE SPECIAL RATES BEYOND THE CUTOFF DATE WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">cancel y</span><span class="font12">our reservations, you should </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">notify the motel directly</span><span class="font12">, doing so as far in advance as possible. This ma</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">kes the room available for other dele</span><span class="font12">gates. If the motel you call first is filled, calfyour next selection from the list, and so on. The convention </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Rooming Department w</span><span class="font12">ill continue to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">provide the congregations with revised lists</span><span class="font12"> as long as necessary, deleting motels that have </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">been filled</span><span class="font12"> and including additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on a list </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">are filled</span><span class="font12">, please </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">wait patientl</span><span class="font12">y for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font12">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>

Elders and others aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves publishers taking those in </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">full-time service</span><span class="font12">, the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">elderly,</span><span class="font12"> the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">infirm</span><span class="font12">, the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">deaf,</span><span class="font12"> or perhaps others with them in their own group. Also, they may care for such ones in other ways. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3: 17,18) Of course, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs who are unable to care for themselves or who cannot be assisted by those from the congregation where they attend. These may </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ask</span><span class="font12"> the c</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">onvention coordinato</span><span class="font12">r in their congregation f</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">or a Special Needs Room Request. form</span><span class="font12">, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should fill out this form. It is to be returned to the convention coordinator and checked for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that would qualify them for special needs consideration. This should be </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">done well ahead of the convention.</span><span class="font12"> The convention coordinator 'then f</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">orwards the form to the convention Rooming Department</span><span class="font12"> and the individual will be notified directly about the accommodations. Those with special needs should </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT go to the convention </span><span class="font12">a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd request a room when they arrive, </span><span class="font12">because the convention Rooming Departmen</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">t needs the verificatio</span><span class="font12">n of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li>

(Mark 6:34; John 4:7, 40, 41) We too must try to reach as many people as we can. Lives are at stake—theirs and ours.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A common problem many of us face, whether working in urban or rural territory, is locating those who are not at home when we first call. Have you tried to call later the same day? Many have had good success in doing so. Or try calling on a different day. Those persistently not at home might be reached by means of a letter. In working urban territory, take the initiative to speak with those you see in the hallways and lobbies of apartment houses or on the sidewalk. If your conversation must be brief, you may find it beneficial to present at least one of the four new tracts: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible, What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?, Life in a Peaceful New World,</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span></p></li></ul>

When approaching people, it is beneficial to be friendly and direct as you endeavor to start a conversation. Posing a brief, pointed question may help you to arouse interest. You will likely find it easiest to approach those who are not moving along hurriedly. Some have had success in walking a few steps with a person as they briefly present the magazines. If the street is crowded, some have found it practical to speak to those on the fringes of the crowd.

<p><span class="font10"><sup></sup> If your congregation regularly covers all its territory, on a temporary basis you may have the opportunity to assist congregations in other areas in the coverage of their territory. During the past service year 120 groups of publishers did so, resulting in many promising return visits and Bible studies. The presiding overseer of one congregation receiving such help stated that 14 publishers “did in ten days what the congregation would do in one month.” Can you assist in such a way this year?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup></sup> There are also those who could request to work one or more of the approximately 240 unassigned territories in the United States. While many served in this way last year, not all these territories were worked. Consequently, we invite you to apply for an assignment this year and increase your share in ‘declaring abroad the kingdom of God.’—Luke 9:60.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup></sup> Any who would like to assist a congregation in the coverage of its territory or work unassigned territory should review the Society’s letter dated January 1, 1988, on this subject.

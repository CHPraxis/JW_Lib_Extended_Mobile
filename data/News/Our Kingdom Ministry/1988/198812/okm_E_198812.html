<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In some areas the weather during December can be cold or rainy. There may betimes when having a share in the Kingdom service is difficult, and it may take more determination on our part to get into the field service. There may also be occasions when we cannot spend as much time out-ofdoors because of unfavorable weather conditions. Nevertheless, with good planning and diligent effort, we can continue to sound forth the Kingdom good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For many people December is a holiday month. Their minds turn to celebrations, the buying and preparing of gifts, visiting relatives, and seasonal social activity. Since much of the celebration is supposedly in honor of Christ, it may be good to highlight matters pertaining to Christ in our preaching work. Informal witnessing also offers the opportunity to discuss the real purpose of Jesus’ birth, focusing on the teachings of the Scriptures regarding God’s Son as our Redeemer. The door-to-door ministry and return visits can stress the real significance of Jesus in the lives of Christians.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">THE OFFER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We will be offering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font10"> for a contribution of $3.00 each or the small-size edition of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book for</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Is the Way”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Isaiah 30:21 states: “Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: ‘This is the way. Walk in it, you people.’” That “word behind you” is the voice of Jehovah speaking through his Word and organization. Are you giving heed to that “word,” and are you helping others to respond to it?—Jas. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Those with whom we study need to appreciate that Jehovah has an organization. We must help them to view the organization in harmony with the fulfillment of prophecy and become motivated to cooperate with it. (Acts, chapter 2; compare Romans 12:5.) What can we do to emphasize the role of the organization in their lives?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">MAKE GOOD USE OF BROCHURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses— Unitedly. Doing God’s Will Worldwide</span><span class="font10"> can be very useful in directing Bible students to Jehovah’s organization. It makes effective use of the Scriptures, pictures, and review questions. It is very beneficial to spend ten minutes or so during or at the close of each study period to dis$1.50. Both publications provide many avenues of approach with the Kingdom good news. Part 6 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> book, beginning with story 84, covers the period from the birth of Jesus to his death. Here we have a wealth of information on various topics dealing with Jesus’ birth. There are the stories entitled “An Angel Visits Mary,” “Jesus Born in a Stable,” and “Men Guided by a Star.” As you can readily appreciate, in these three stories alone, you have many points that can be used in talking with those you meet in the field during the Christmas holidays. This would be particularly true where there are children in the family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Chapter 6, beginning on page 57 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book, is entitled “Jesus Christ—Sent by God?&quot; This provides many talking points concerning Jesus’ prehuman existence, his life on earth, and the reason for his coming, including his current role as Ruler of God’s Kingdom. In view of the fact that the birth of Jesus is in the minds of many people at this particular time of the year, you can see the benefit of directing attention to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book to heighten their interest in accurate information about our Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If the book offer is not accepted, you may offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font10"> brochure. Here, too, it is possible to highlight </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font10">cuss information from the brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The student should be encouraged to review the article or the portion that can be covered during the allotted time. Perhaps you will want to limit your discussion to one or two questions. For example, when discussing “Jehovah Gathers and Equips His People for Work,” you could spend the entire time on the third question on page 11. Using the scriptures cited while reviewing the points made on pages 8 and 9 can help the student understand Jehovah’s direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Make good use of the pictures in “Congregations for Building Up in Love and Unity,” beginning on page 12. Why not make a point of using these to show the basic responsibilities of the elders? Such emphasis will make it easier for the student to learn to go to the elders when experiencing problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> When reviewing the meetings, consider only one each week. This can be done when you are about to discuss the answer to question 2 in</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Even though December’s weather may prove inclement at times, all should strive to have a meaningful share in unitedly doing Jehovah’s will.

December offers us a fine opportunity to do just that, since in many cases people will be thinking about the religious holidays. coming year.

The </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">63 Re-, </span><span class="font12">gional Building Committees reported that </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">335_ project</span><span class="font12">s involving c</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">onstruction of new King</span><span class="font12"></span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">dom Hall^pr</span><span class="font12">j</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">renovation of existing building</span><span class="font12">s were completed last year. Many of the new Kingdom Hall building projects were financed entirely or in part by the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The guidelines that the Society has provided for the Re</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">gional Building Commit</span><span class="font12">tees have helped to si</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">mplify </span><span class="font12">and spe</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed up</span><span class="font12"> building procedures, while enhancing safety. The appointed committees now sc</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hedule skilled craf</span><span class="font12">ts</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">men</span><span class="font12"> to be at the construction site only during the time that their sKUlsare actually needed. This li</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">mits the number of worker</span><span class="font12">s on the site at any one time and allows them t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">o spend </span><span class="font12">mo</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">re time with their families a</span><span class="font12">nd</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;"> congregations</span><span class="font12">. One Regional Building Committee reported :(^By following the Society’s guidelines . . . , we were able to schedule closely each trade as it was needed. We have experienced a ve</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ry noticeable inc</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through underline;">rea</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">se in nffioionoy</span><span class="font12">, safety, and </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">quality</span><span class="font12"> of work. . . . [The workers] came and went as scheduled. This was apprec</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">iated. by thp workers</span><span class="font12"> that came from distant places, being there only when needed and then returning home to family and congregation. This has hel</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ped to reduce conges</span><span class="font12"></span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">tion and food costs</span><span class="font12"> and has increased safety.” Another commented: “Each department was o</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">n the job only as needed</span><span class="font12"> . . . 140 to 180 workers was the peak at any one time. Having </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">no young children on the job was an improvement</span><span class="font12">, making it safer and easier to accomplish work.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The fine q</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">uality</span><span class="font12"> of the w</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ork,</span><span class="font12"> has been o</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">bserved</span><span class="font12"> by others.

<p><span class="font12">Official, don’t worry—‘quick-build’ will do you proud!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WILLING VOLUNTEERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Along with experienced elders serving on Regional Building Committees, volunteers representing_66 d</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ifferent trades</span><span class="font12"> are used during the year to assist congregations with their Kingdom Hall projects. This too is a fine expression of brotherly love, as this work takes them away from their congregations and families.—Rom. 12:10; Heb. 13:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> PgahxullO :3- says to the enthroned Jesus: (“Your people will offer themselves w</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">illingly </span><span class="font12">on the day of your military force,” ^nd this is true not only in the preaching and disciplemaking work but also in construction projects. Of course, in all of this, we look to Jehovah-to-bjess the arrangement. As P^alrn 12ZLL<sub>k</sub>saysv‘Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it.” )</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATIONS CAN ASSIST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> There is much that each congregation can do to support the Kingdom Hall construction program. For instance, congregations contemplating undertaking new construction projects can </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">select a simple design</span><span class="font12"> that will neither be costly nor require intensive labor. (Compare Philippians 1:10.) The So</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ciety</span><span class="font12"> has a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">vailable a variety of Kingdom Hall plans</span><span class="font12"> that are compatible with the method of construction used for quickly built halls. (Please note the December 1986 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font12">insert, paragraphs 10-12.) While we look forward to Jehovah’s blessing upon our congregations, we must also be practical in our building design so as to meet the need, without placing an unnecessary burden on either the friends or the resources of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Some congregations have included in their Kingd</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">om Hall design a modest apartment </span><span class="font12">that can be used b</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">y a traveling oversee</span><span class="font12">r while serving in the area. In the future, congregations building Kingdom Halls that will be centrally located in the circuit may want to consi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">der whether it would be practical to includ</span><span class="font12">e </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">a room</span><span class="font12"> where the circuit overseer and his wife can be accommodated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> When undertaking a Kingdom Hall building project, the need for local financial sup</span></p><img src="okm_E_198812_files/okm_E_198812-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:235pt;height:375pt;"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">port can be discussed frankly with the congregation^) involved. The more finances the brothers provide locally with both contributions and loans, the less they will need to borrow. This allows more of the resources of the Kingdom Hall Fund to be available for other congregations to use in building their Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Some congregations, after requesting assistance from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund and being advised that they would have to wait because moneys were not available at the time, have then found </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">sufficient loans and </span><span class="font12">contr</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ibutions available lo</span><span class="font12">cally tn mmpiato their project. It is good to check thoroughly the availability of such funds before requesting help. (Luke 14:28-30) Surveys indicate there are a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">t present over 470 Kingdom Hall</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">construction projects in need of financial-assistance! And when we consider the cost of a new Kingdom Hall, this represen</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ts a consid</span><span class="font12">er</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">able amount of money</span><span class="font12"> that will be needed to complete these projects. Phifin</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">p</span><span class="font12">i</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ans 2:4</span><span class="font12"> reminds us:\Keep an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.’,)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> Many congregations and circuits have assisted regularly by </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">passing resolutions autho</span><span class="font12"></span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rizing that funds be contrib</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through underline;">u</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">ted tn tbp s^ripiy </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kingdom Hall Fund</span><span class="font12">. This is commendable and appreciated. Even though a congregation follows this procedure, a Society </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font12">Fu</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd contribution box</span><span class="font12"> conveniently located in the Kingdom Hall will enable individuals desiring to do so to make voluntary contributions to the fund. Any moneys placed in this contribution box should be forwarded to the Society </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">in addition to</span><span class="font12"> those covered by the congregation’s resolution. Individuals may also make direct contributions to the fund, sending their remittances to the Society with an accompanying letter specifying the purpose of the contribution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PRESENT NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> There are various reasons why some congregations are eager to build new Kingdom Halls. Although some early Kingdom Halls may have been built initially in fine neighborhoods and at the time were of sufficient size to care for the needs of the congregations, circumstances have changed, and we have experienced wonderful growth. Some congregations have simply outgrown their present hall. The meetings are overcrowded, and at times the attendance may exceed legal limits. Usually these halls also have insufficient parking space.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Many congregations still meet in rented buildings, such as community centers. The meeting schedule is subject to change, or use of the facility may be cancelled at the discretion of the management. This may occur because of conflicting schedules, civic events, and so forth. In these instances, all the equipment and seating is makeshift, requiring setting up for each meeting and dismantling afterward. Sometimes these places are decorated inside and outside according to the worldly holiday season. Often rented facilities are in downtown areas where parking is limited. This has caused difficulties and tense situations with neighbors. Also, the community may view the congregation as lacking permanency, and this hinders growth. Some of these facilities are upstairs, making access difficult, and at times dangerous, for older or infirm persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> Some Kingdom Halls are located far from any population center. Attending meetings requires extra travel time and expense for the publishers and interested ones. Such halls may be difficult for new ones to find, and this limits growth in the area. Some have been built in low-lying areas that flood periodically. On the other hand, Kingdom Halls built in metropolitan areas a number of years ago may now be in neighborhoods that have deteriorated. At times in such neighborhoods,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">vandalism is directed at the Kingdom Hall and at the brothers’ automobiles. Neighbors have threatened the brothers and sisters. All of this does not make for a pleasant atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EXCELLENT RESULTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> Following the construction of a doubleauditorium Kingdom Hall, a congregation in New York State reported: “One member of the local community block club group that was extremely opposed to our building the Kingdom Hall came by after the project was up. She apologized for being negative about the Kingdom Hall and said that it was the most amazing thing she had ever seen in her life. She said that the peace and unity displayed on this building project could only come about because of our having the Lord’s backing, adding, ‘Don’t be surprised to see me at your meeting.’ Other members of that same block club came by with movie cameras to take pictures, and they invited us to their meeting as their guests to welcome us to the community and for us to talk about our beliefs. People in the city as a whole are much more willing to talk to us at their doors, and they view us in a much more favorable light. .. . The experiences are unlimited.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> A congregation in Kentucky that had previously met in a remodeled older home wrote regarding the construction of their new Kingdom Hall: “Our experience in the community was very favorable, with many comments regarding ‘what can be accomplished with true unity and cooperation.’ We also received a lot of help from local businesses in the loan of various things, such as front-end loaders, telephone service for the building weekend, Saturday service from building supply houses, and very reasonable food prices. The list goes on and on. Our plumbing supplier, located over 50 miles away, was so interested that he gave us his home phone number and offered to bring any needed supplies on Saturday or Sunday at his expense, saying he really wanted an excuse to come and see such a project.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> The building project generally encourages the publishers, in addition to making a long-lasting impression on the community. One body of elders in West Virginia reported: “We have experienced great joy in our new hall. The local friends have really taken pride in it and are much more diligent in taking their turn in maintaining it. We have also noticed that our meeting attendance has improved. The community has really responded also. While for most their interest in the truth is still reserved, they have commented very favorably on what was accomplished and still do, even though a year has passed. Jejiovah’s </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">name has certainly gained a greater respect</span><span class="font12"></span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ability</span><span class="font12">, and our preaching work too has gained more respect. The new hall seems to have given us a better foothold in the territory than we experienced before.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EXPRESSIONS OF APPRECIATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>19</sup> Congregations have written expressions of appreciation for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Representative of these are the sentiments expressed by a congregation in Indiana: “It was a wonderful experience for all of us here. . . . We also want to thank the Society for the material assistance provided by the building fund. Having this assistance allowed us to build a Kingdom Hall large enough to accommodate our growing needs.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> One congregation in Alabama had met in a mobile home under cramped conditions for three years. After completing the construction of a new Kingdom Hall with assistance from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, they wrote: “From the fullness of our hearts, we thank you. People in our territory are absolutely amazed at what Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing. The wonderful thing about it is they are talking about Jehovah. Some are coming to our meetings, others come by just to see the Kingdom Hall. We have started some very fine Bible studies, and one is headed for baptism.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>21</sup> As we look to the future, we pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing on the Kingdom Hall construction program. By our wholehearted support, we can show our appreciation for the Kingdom Hall and its role in helping us to encourage one another and “incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) This involves faithfully caring for our own Kingdom Hall and assisting others with contributions, volunteer labor, and other needed support as we are able. In this regard let us all be determined not to “give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.”—Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Theocratic Ministry School Brings Benefits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Since 1943 the Theocratic Ministry School has proved to be a real blessing to those who have taken advantage of its fine provisions. Yes, the Theocratic Ministry School continues to accomplish its two main objectives: (1) to improve our ability to speak Bible truth and (2) to make us more familiar with God’s Word, its doctrines, and its principles. Many have expressed deep appreciation for the benefits received from the progressive training of the Theocratic Ministry School. Both brothers and sisters have been helped to ‘handle the word of truth aright.’—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">MAKING ADVANCEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Those who are newly enrolled as well as those who have been in the school for many years can gain the greatest benefit by carefully preparing their assignments. It has been observed that some read their presentation. To become more proficient in giving a witness requires both good reading and the ability to express oneself extemporaneously.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book has proved to be a fine asset in our work, and the Theocratic Ministry School is an excellent forum through which we have become better acquainted with its many features. Becoming more familiar with this publication will enable us to express ideas in our own words and to be more conversational. During 1989 we will continue to benefit from a progressive consideration of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book by means of the student talks based on material in that publication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">INSTRUCTIONS FOR 1989</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> During the coming year, Assignment No. 1 will still be based on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.”</span><span class="font10"> Although 15 minutes will be allotted, a slight adjustment is being made. From 10 to 12 minutes may be used for the talk and from 3 to 5 minutes for the oral review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Highlights from the Bible reading will continue to be one of the most important parts of the Theocratic Ministry School. Brothers who handle this assignment should help the audience understand </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">why </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font10"> the information is of value to us. Using the Scripture index in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font10"> can be of much assistance. Additionally, special articles on books of the Hebrew Scriptures will continue to appear in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> and these will provide background material and other practical points that can be used. If the weekly presentation of Bible highlights is not properly cared for, the school overseer will give private counsel.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">WRITTEN REVIEWS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Beginning in 1989, a change will be made in the way in which written reviews are handled. Reviews will be held three times during the year —at the end of April, August, and December. The Society will no longer provide a printed review sheet, but each publisher should bring his own paper and pen so he may participate. As in the past, prepared questions with their answers will be provided by the Society. In the written reviews, particular attention will be given to material covered in Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">BIBLE READING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Are we personally benefiting from the assigned Bible reading? As we read, let us look for scriptures that build appreciation, that strengthen qualities needed in our personal and family life, or that help us apply the examples in the narratives. Have we tried doing our weekly Bible reading while listening to the Society’s Bible tapes? By thus utilizing the senses of seeing and hearing we can greatly enhance our grasp of the material. Let us not overlook the excellent help these tapes provide for brothers assigned to prepare Talk No. 2. By paying attention to proper pronunciation, voice inflection, sense stress, and modulation, these can make their reading more lively and meaningful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah has made abundant spiritual provision to assist us in our vital preaching work. At Psalm 19: 14, David expressed his prayerful desire: “Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.” If, as in David’s case, love for Jehovah and his Son wells up in our heart, the Theocratic Ministry School can help us make the sayings of our mouth more pleasurable to Jehovah during 1989. Let us determine now to benefit fully from this loving provision of our kind heavenly Father.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How often are you working your territory? If the territory is covered often, you are especially blessed. Why? Because congregations that work their territory frequently usually experience rapid growth. This has been the experience of congregations in many large cities. For example, in New York City, where most territory is worked regularly, there are now more than 340 congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When working a territory that was being covered weekly, one brother met a woman who said she had never been contacted before. She eagerly took literature and was glad someone found her. So there are still people in such territory who have not had the opportunity to hear the good news. (Compare 2 Pe--ter 3:9b.) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Thorough</span><span class="font10"> coverage of frequently worked territory is important in order to search out sheeplike people.—Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">MEETING THE CHALLENGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Where territory is worked frequently, it is vital to keep an accurate house-to-house record. Lists of not-at-homes can be used to keep groups busy in the field when other territory is not available. Why not use evening witnessing periods to try to reach those not found at home earlier in the day? Remember, those away during the day and on weekends are often relaxing at home in the evenings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you cover your territory several times while using one Topic for Conversation, it is beneficial to vary your introduction. You can find appropriate introductions on pages 9-15 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book. Use these to help start conversations with those you meet.—Prov. 1:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another way to vary your introduction is to offer a tract. Tie the subject of the tract in with the Topic for Conversation. Also, make use of current news events. Asking questions about such things may provide a basis for a fine discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">WITNESS TO ALL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Do you spend about 50 percent of your service time making return visits and conducting Bible studies? If you keep a separate house-to-house record of those who show interest, you will be able to give your record of not-at-homes to the one holding the territory. Be sure to call back promptly on all who accept literature as well as on any others who show interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We will be able to reach even more people with the good news if we are alert to all our opportunities to give a witness. For example, while working our territory, we often see people leaving homes or apartments. Wherever possible and appropriate, why not briefly offer the magazines or a tract?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Even where territory is worked each week, keep in mind that very likely there are honesthearted ones who have not yet been found even though we have made repeated efforts to contact them. And though you have witnessed at the same door previously, you may meet a different person this time. Therefore, like the apostles, let us witness thoroughly in our assigned territory. —Acts 8:14, 25; 20:20, 21.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S BLESSING EVIDENT IN APRIL REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The April service report for the United States gives clear evidence of Jehovah’s abundant blessing as thousands more share in the harvest work.—Matt. 9:37, 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: A new peak of 780,744 publishers was reached. This is 33,788 more than one year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliary Pioneers: A new peak of 101,145 reported. This figure combined with the number serving as regular pioneers totals 158,156. This Is the highest number ever to serve as pioneers during any one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 16,996,871. This new peak Is 759,128 over our previous peak of hours In April 1987. How commendable that congregation publishers averaged 10.1 hoursl</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: 570,094. An increase of 17,056 over our peak in March of this year and a 3.8-percent increase over last April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Is carrying out his promise to fill his spiritual house with glory by bringing In “the desirable things&quot; of all the nations. (Hag. 2:7) May our joy Increase and abound as we continue to experience Jehovah’s rich blessings upon our zealous activity in the harvest work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible Benefits Family Life. Gen. 1:27, 28—God instituted the family arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 48:17, 18—Family members benefit from heeding God’s Word.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking God’s Word With Boldness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How are you affected when faced with opposition or when you are persecuted by enemies of the good news? Are you determined to keep on witnessing despite what opposers may say or do? Although only a few may let their heart grow faint or be tempted to stop preaching, all of us can benefit from the example of Paul and Silas. They did not let persecution discourage or silence them. (1 Thess. 2:2) With Jehovah’s help, we too can demonstrate the boldness needed in order to come off victorious in the face of opposition.—Ps. 138:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah is our refuge in time of trouble. It is to him that we humbly appeal for help. (Ps. 18:2, 3) Our brothers in the first century asked Jehovah to help them ‘keep on speaking his word with all boldness.’ (Acts 4:29) Jehovah responded to this prayer by filling the disciples with holy spirit. He will do the same for us. —Acts 4:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In each congregation, meetings for field service are arranged to pro</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have the Pioneer Spirit?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is the “pioneer spirit”? It might be defined as having a positive attitude toward the command to preach and make disciples, being fully committed to showing love and concern for people, being selfsacrificing, finding joy in following the Master closely, and taking pleasure in spiritual, not material, things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s people as a whole are certainly manifesting this spirit today. Even in the face of bitter persecution and other adversities, they joyfully forge ahead in proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> However, living as we are deep within the time of the end, the anxiety and stress of everyday living can take its toll, perhaps diminishing our zeal and enthusiasm for spiritual vide encouraging discussions of spiritual matters before going into the territory. Do you support these meetings whenever possible? The pioneers and those who are able to spend more time in the ministry may especially be able to give other publishers the benefit of their experience as they go from door to door. Also, by applying suggestions from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, all can be better equipped to speak with conviction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In some areas, the brothers are finding that many people are not at home during the day. Various methods may be used to reach these people. Some publishers do street work near bus stops and train stations or in front of apartment houses at hours when people are leaving for work or coming home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It requires courage and boldness to approach strangers and initiate conversations with them, but the results can be most rewarding. Like the apostles, it is necessary to speak </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font10">matters. Each person might ask himself, ‘Do I have the pioneer spirit? Am I allowing this system of things to rob me of it? Am I zealous for the truth, eager to tell others about God's Kingdom? Do I promote the pioneer spirit in the congregation and encourage others to become more fully involved in doing God’s will? What can I do to overcome a negative or indifferent attitude?’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO CULTIVATE THE PIONEER SPIRIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The pioneer spirit is essentially a heart condition, and we must cultivate it. Since we feed the heart on the things we read and listen to, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">personal Bible study</span><span class="font10"> plays an important role in our cultivating the pioneer spirit.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Some arrange to work in unassigned territory, and this also requires boldness. During the summer months this year, over 3,400 brothers and sisters will engage in this work. Some will travel thousands of miles. It is a pleasure to see the brothers willingly engage in this activity even at great personal sacrifice.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> When Paul was first invited by Jesus to be his follower, he responded with zeal and preached with boldness. (Acts 9:5, 15, 16, 20, 27, 28) He continued faithfully in the same course right down to his death.

<p><span class="font10">Paul admonished Timothy: “Ponder over these things . . . that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.... Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:15, 16) It is necessary, therefore, for us to meditate on spiritual matters so as to sound them down into our heart, the seat of motivation. By so doing we will develop a longing to do God’s will. Our appreciation for spiritual matters will deepen, and we will look for ways to expand our ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">things we talk about</span><span class="font10"> can either tear our brothers down or build them up. (Eph. 4:29) By sharing field experiences and points we enjoyed at the meetings or in personal study, we impart thoughts that are positive and encouraging. In addition, when we have occasion to talk with people in our daily routine of life, do we look for opportunities to give an informal witness? If we do, we are following in the footsteps of our Exemplar, Jesus. —John 4:7-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Developing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">love for neighbor </span><span class="font10">helps us to cultivate the pioneer spirit. (Matt. 22:39) Jesus demonstrated this kind of love when he was on earth. He felt pity for the people and wanted to do all he could to help them, though it meant great personal attending the “Divine Justice” District Convention.—See note under “Meetings to Jtelp Us Make Disciples” in June </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">dur Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POSITIVE EFFECT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> There are many blessings and benefits that come from manifesting the pioneer spirit in our lives. As we increase our activity in the ministry, we become more effective teachers, and this can bring us much joy. As the pioneer spirit grows in the congregation, so will the warmth and spirituality of the brothers. Concerning the wholesome effect pioneer service has had on his congregation, one elder remarked: “What a difference it made! The congregation’s pace changed. The tendency is to increase our participation in Jehovah’s service more and more.”—See the September 15, 1985, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 26, paragraph 1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> As the 1989 service year approaches, make it your resolve to help cultivate the pioneer spirit in the congregation. Look for ways to expand your ministry. Plan ahead to auxiliary pioneer whenever possible, or perhaps reach out for the regular pioneer service. Whether pioneers or publishers, all in the congregation can have the pioneer spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Help New Ones to Comment at Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How thrilling it is to hear a Bible student make his first comment at the Kingdom Hall! It surely gives us a feeling of satisfaction, a confirmation, as it were, that the new one is really taking hold of the truth. New ones need to realize that making public expression is necessary. It is a proof of faith that leads to salvation. —Rom. 10:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jesus said: “Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” (Luke 6:40) That should impress upon us the fact that we can teach new ones to comment at meetings by doing so ourselves. We can help them appreciate that a prerequisite for commenting is knowledge. Teach them that study should be done with the purpose of putting knowledge to use in the meetings and in the field as well as in directing one’s personal life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Some new ones may hold back, feeling that they are incapable of commenting as well as others do. However, we can help new ones to appreciate that simplicity is important in making good expressions. If our own comments are appropriate, brief, and to the point, new ones will not feel obligated to make lengthy expressions. They can be helped to analyze the question, find the thought in the paragraph that gives the answer, and then put that thought in their own words. It is also important for them to see how the cited or quoted scriptures relate to the point being made. Help them to see how they can use the scriptures in</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rendering Sacred Service With Godly Fear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> During the 1988 service year, the Society has received many letters expressing heartfelt appreciation for the circuit assembly program “The Excelling Value of Serving Jehovah.” These letters have expressed sentiments similar to those of the psalmist who said: “A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere.” (Ps. 84:10) We know that all of you have similar feelings about our grand privilege of serving Jehovah and that you too benefited from this program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Starting in September, the new circuit assembly program will develop the theme “Rendering Sacred Service With Godly Fear.” (Heb. 12:28) While the world foolishly ignores Jehovah and despises the message of his Kingdom, we delight in our privilege of rendering sacred service with godly fear. Truly, a wholesome fear of Jehovah is “the beginning of wisdom”; it is “pure,” motivating us to do his will. (Ps. 19:9; 111:10) The circuit assembly program for the 1989 ser-the paragraph to support their comments. Teach them to underline key words and perhaps make brief notes in the margin. Encourage them to use sufficient volume and to speak distinctly so that all in attendance can benefit from their prepared comments. Being well prepared will keep them from being too fearful to comment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What else can we do to encourage new ones to comment? Of course, sitting with them can be reassuring and comforting. You may want to suggest that they sit toward the front where there are fewer distractions. Point out the questions that can be answered in very few words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> When the Congregation Book Study conductor has become acquainted with a new one in his group, he might ask him to read a scripture. Afterward, a genuine expression of appreciation for his efforts may encourage the new one to continue making comments at the book study and later start participating regularly at other meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> It is a privilege to share in commenting at meetings. (Heb. 10: 24, 25) We want to help new ones to appreciate this. It can provide an added encouragement and blessing to all concerned. Whether in the field service or at our congregation meetings, we have opportunities to do as Hebrews 13:15 reminds us: “Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” vice year will help us to appreciate more fully what the fear of Jehovah is and how we can manifest it in our service to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> As the program unfolds, we will learn how godly fear should affect us in our ministry, in our meeting attendance, and in our day-to-day living. The need to close any gap between what we know and what we do will be discussed. We must know not only what to do but also how to apply the things that we learn so as to benefit ourselves and others and to bring praise to our God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The public talk is entitled “Why Fear the True God?” Be sure to invite your Bible students as well as other interested persons. Surely, all of us want to arrange our affairs in order to attend and benefit fully from this splendid two-day program. Your circuit overseer will inform you of the location and the dates that are scheduled for your congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Group Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Meeting with others in preparation for field service is both practical and upbuilding. Such a provision encourages our brothers to work shoulder to shoulder in proclaiming the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some congregations may schedule a meeting for field service to follow one of the regular meetings at the Kingdom Hall. While the number supporting this arrangement may be quite large, book study conductors still give attention to the needs of the publishers in their respective groups. This arrangement may be convenient for the majority of the publishers who will be going out in field service that day. Depending on their situation, other congregations hold their weekend meetings for field service at each Congregation Book Study. There are obvious advantages in this arrangement. It is recognized that circumstances vary from one congregation to another. The combining of some very small groups may be appropriate at times. So the body of elders needs to consider the local circumstances and determine what arrangements will accomplish the most good.—See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> pages 96-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPORT MEETINGS FOR FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Group witnessing arranged on the book study level provides a fine opportunity for the conductor to give personalized assistance. New publishers as well as those who are more experienced can benefit from working with the elders and the ministerial servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Midweek meetings for field service may be held at the Kingdom Hall or at various locations convenient to the publishers. Whether two or more meetings are held depends on local circumstances and the availability of elders, ministerial servants, or other competent individuals assigned to care for the meeting and take the lead in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In view of the urgency of the times, we want to reach as many people as possible with the Kingdom message. What can the book study conductors or those assigned to care for the group do to ensure that all make the best use of the time they have scheduled for group witnessing? Conductors can bear in mind that the meeting for field service should last no more than 10 to 15 minutes. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry, </span><span class="font10">page 77.) Much time can be saved when territory is assigned before going into the field, thereby avoiding large groups meeting on the street corner and appearing to be disorganized. Some have found it helpful to assign portions of the territory to qualified publishers for a period of time. Thus, once groups are arranged, they can leave immediately for their territory. The service overseer should be alert to resolve problems with organizing groups so that more time can be spent in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Many longtime publishers fondly recall experiences shared through the years while working with others in group activity. Such experiences serve to strengthen the unity of the congregation and the bonds of Christian love. While at times there may be good reasons for two publishers to work together, in many territories more can be accomplished by working alone while others are witnessing nearby. Working alone in field service, where conditions permit, allows us to reach more people, and it can be good training for the future in the event that unexpected restrictions are imposed on our preaching work. (See the November 15, 1985, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 13, paragraph 11.) Good judgment, as well as a desire to accomplish as much as possible, should govern the arrangements that we make.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The apostle Paul encouraged fellow Christians of his day to “hold fast the public declaration of our hope.&quot; Also, his inspired words tell us to “consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together . . . but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:23-25) Through support of the local arrangements for group witnessing, may we succeed in inciting our fellow Kingdom proclaimers “to love and fine works.” As we do, we will reap many fine rewards in Jehovah's service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The graduation of the second class of the Ministerial Training School took place on Sunday, May 22, 1988, In Los Angeles, California. The 14 elders and 12 ministerial servants are assigned to 13 different countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Korea reported a new peak of 50,164 publishers for February, a 9-percent increase over last year's average. They were happy to have a new peak of 14,308 regular pioneers. ♦ Martinique had a new peak of 2,433 publishers in February for a 10-percent increase.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Make Effective Use of Special-Purpose Articles</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Magazine distribution is increasing steadily. The 1979 production of 394,899,446 magazines leaped to 585,369,060 in 1987, nearly a 50-percent increase, or 190,469,614 more magazines printed in 1987 than in 1979! And over 1,135,585,000 copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">were printed in the past two years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> With the use of full color, a dramatic improvement in appearance occurred in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> in January 1986 and in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> in January 1987. Have you appreciated this? Many have, and they have told us so. The question is, Can we make even more effective use of our magazines?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> To help you do this, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> will announce in advance special-purpose articles or articles that may be of special interest to a particular segment of the people in your territory. Suggestions on whom these might appeal to will be provided. If publishers desire extra copies, these should be ordered immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For example, the September 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> features the subject “Parents—You Have Homework Too!&quot; The articles should appeal to every schoolteacher and school administrator because the articles emphasize the responsibilities of parents to cooperate with the school system in educating their young. Also, every parent can benefit from the information. So your congregation may want to order extra copies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The October 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will have a comprehensive coverage of the disease AIDS, which will be of real interest to many people, including those in the medical field. And the October 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> discusses the issue of divorce and child custody. You may want to leave a copy with every lawyer and family counselor in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Rush shipments of extra magazines should be avoided. This can be done if the service overseer anticipates the congregation’s needs and sends in orders without delay.</span></p></li></ul>

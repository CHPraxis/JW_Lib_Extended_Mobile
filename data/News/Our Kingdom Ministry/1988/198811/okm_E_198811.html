<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a delight it was to be in attendance during all four days of our “Divine Justice&quot; District Convention! Indeed, each day the program overflowed with encouragement and practical suggestions on how we can manifest God’s justice and righteousness to a greater degree. Now that you have returned home to your regular routine of activities, are you ‘practicing the things that you learned, heard, and saw demonstrated’? (Phil. 4:9) It will be beneficial to review some highlights from the convention program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Recall the talk “Lead a Balanced, Simple Life” that was given on Thursday afternoon. This was based on Jesus’ counsel at Matthew 6:19-33. Have you thought deeply about what you can do to unburden yourself of unnecessary things, allowing more time for study, meeting preparation, and helping others? What adjustments can you personally make in order to lead a simple life give a variety of conclusive proofs that the Bible is the inspired Word of God.</span></p></li>

Why? Perhaps it was because they became discouraged over not being able to understand what they read It may be that we can help such persons by encouraging them to read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </span><span class="font10">Some </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">50,000,000 copies</span><span class="font10"> of this easy-to-read modern-language translation have been produced in ni</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ne different </span><span class="font10">l</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">anguages</span><span class="font10">, making it one of the main 20th-century Bible translations in use today.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The need to benefit from all the training that Jehovah provides through his Word and organization was emphasized in the part “Accept Discipline and Become Wise.” One area where some may need to pay particular attention is in refining and improving their ministry. Do we regularly use the suggested Topic for Conversation, engaging the householder in a Bible discussion? Or are we content with brief magazine presentations? Do we apply counsel and suggestions on using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book, following up interest, and conducting Bible studies?—Prov. 8:33.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">18 min: Educating Our Tongue to Help the Discouraged. Many things tend to discourage people today: economic problems, loss of loved ones in death, illness, spiritual problems on the part of children or mate, and so forth. Giving way to discouragement makes us more vulnerable to Satan’s attacks. (Prov. 24:10; compare Luke 22:31.) Christians are under obligation to encourage and support one another. (1 Thess. 5:14; Gal. 6:2) In this we imitate Christ. (Matt. 11: 28-30) How? By being sympathetic. (Rom. 12:15) By being ready to respond in practical ways. (Jas. 2: 14-17; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">rs</span><span class="font10"> pp. 117-21) Using </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, have audience comment on what scriptures can be used to help persons in congregation and field deal with the specific problems outlined. Have two or three in audience prepared to give comments from seat to show how others encouraged them in time of need and when they faced personal problems. (Acts 28:15) Draw close to Jehovah, seek help of elders, and persevere in prayer, thus successfully fighting discouragement.—Jas. 4:8; Isa. 32:1, 2; Eph. 6: 17,18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">• From time to time the Society receives inquiries from publishers in the United States who are considering naturalization. Whether one should apply for U.S. citizenship or not is entirely a personal decision. It is not necessary to be a citizen of a particular country in order to be baptized or to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Each individual must make his own final decision. A factor to consider is whether the naturalization law may require one to violate Bible principles and conscience. The Society’s publications in the past have commented on the general topics of oaths and citizenship. Sufficient information to assist one who is making a decision on citizenship is provided by examining these topics in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When a householder opens the door, the publisher of the good news is faced with the challenge of introducing the Kingdom message in an appropriate way. Within the next t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">en second</span><span class="font10">s, the householder will often </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">decide whether to listen</span><span class="font10"> to the presentation or to dismiss the Witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">As Kingdom preachers, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">we know the </span><span class="font10">i</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nformation we bring is vitally ini</span><span class="font10">-P2£iant, and we really want to help those with whom we speak.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING THE RIGHT INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Beginning on pa</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ge 9 o</span><span class="font10">f the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, there is’ an excellent section entitled “Introductions for Use in the Field Ministry.” A review of the opening remarks in this section will no doubt be very helpful. At the outset, we are reminded that </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">different approaches</span><span class="font10"> are needed for d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ifferent kinds of territories</span><span class="font10">, p</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eople</span><span class="font10">, and circumstances. Selection of the right introduction requires careful consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> As you introduce the Kingdom message, can you show how it will benefit the householder personally? As an example, consider the first introduction under the heading “Crime/Safety” on page 10 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book. In the first statement, a subject of vital concern to the householder is introduced. The subsequent discussion would show the Kingdom’s role in eliminating crime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> H</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ow can we clear out obstacles to </span><span class="font10">th</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e householder’s willingness to con</span><span class="font10"></span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">sider our message</span><span class="font10">? The headings on pages </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">14 and 15</span><span class="font10"> in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">easoning </span><span class="font10">book offer excellent suggestions. For example, think about how you might use the introduction under the heading “When Many People Say: ‘I Have My Own Religion.’” The first statement may arouse the interest of the householder. Can you use this approach in your territory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> How can we demonstrate our genuine interest in the </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">welfare</span><span class="font10"> of the householder? (Mark 6:34) </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A sin</span><span class="font10">c</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ere, friendlv smile</span><span class="font10"> can help. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Friendliness attracts others</span><span class="font10"> and is in keeping with our purpose to help people. Our interest in the householder is also shown by e</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ncouraging him to </span><span class="font10">o</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffer his</span><span class="font10"> comments. An </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">honest re</span><span class="font10">quest for his opinion can do much to help him listen to our message. An e</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">xample of this is seen in the se</span><span class="font10">co</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd introduction under “Kingdom</span><span class="font10">”• o</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">n page 12.</span><span class="font10"> Have you used this? In general, people like to give their opinion, and they will be curious about what question you are going to ask. If we are to retain their interest, though, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">we must </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">listen</span><span class="font10"> t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o their </span><span class="font10">r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">esponse</span><span class="font10"> and then adjust our presentation to take advantage of what we have learned about their views.</span></p></li></ul>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IPRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS ----</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To Children</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A look around you at most congregation meetings and certainly at large conventions provides abundant evidence that there is a vast crowd of ‘young men, virgins, and boys’ —yes, children—praising Jehovah. (Ps. 148:12) This should remind each of us of the need to give young ones we meet in field service every opportunity to learn of Jehovah and his promises. Our being alert and prepared to witness to children will afford them this opportunity. There are several factors that should be considered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A positive attitude toward children and their capacity for developing a love for Jehovah is needed. Bible examples, such as Samuel, David, and Timothy, provide assurance that those young in years can be unswervingly devoted to God. (1 Sam. 2:18; Ps. 71:17; 2 Tim. 3:14, 15) There are also modern-day examples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN A YOUNG ONE ANSWERS THE DOOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When a youth answers the door, do you customarily ask to speak with the parents? Do you then proceed to the next door if the parents are not at home? That young person’s life is precious also. Why not adjust your presentation and share the good news with him or her? A simple presentation explaining what Paradise will be like or a brief statement regarding what the future holds could be used to arouse interest. For example, many children are familiar with the Lord’s Prayer and can readily understand comments as to what the answer to that prayer will mean in the way of changed world conditions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In witnessing to children, it is important to respect parental authority. Discretion should be used in offering literature to children. Depending on their age, it may be appropriate to ask if their parents al-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Encourage Others &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a contribution </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">of $5.00</span><span class="font10">. By offering these two publications enthusiastically, we may be able to encourage more people to read and study God’s Word. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:line-through;">A.s an introduct</span><span class="font10">i</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:line-through;">o</span><span class="font10">n to the current Topic for Conversation, you may want to adapt the second introduction under “Bi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ble/God&quot; on page 10</span><span class="font10"> of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;"> book</span><span class="font10">. Or an adaptation of the first introduction under “F</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">amily/Children” on page 11</span><span class="font10"> may be appropriate for you and your territory. Being prepared with these two low them to choose their own reading material. If they are not at liberty to accept literature but do show interest, witness to them orally and arrange to call back when their parents are at home. This may be a stepping-stone to helping the parents as well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Being adaptable and alert includes being aware that we have what young people need. Jehovah’s organization has prepared appealing publications with timely information designed to reach young people of all ages. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font10"> books hold special interest for those tender in years. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Family Life</span><span class="font10"> books contain pertinent information to aid those who are older. And what a treasure is to be found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines! The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> feature “Young People Ask ...” and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> series “Jesus’ Life and Ministry” would be appropriate to offer to children. The four-color illustrations throughout both magazines can stir the imagination of youths and arouse in them a desire to know the God who is responsible for the endless marvels of creation. Not to be overlooked are the colorful brochures, such as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font10"> So when you prepare for field service, give thought to what you can take along that would appeal to young people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s execution of judgment will affect all, including “young man and virgin and little child.” (Ezek. 9:6) The fact that some who have served Jehovah for many years embraced the truth at a tender age should help us see the need to give a witness to children we meet in the ministry. We can show loving concern just as Jesus did and bring a blessing by sharing the good news with them. (Matt. 19:14, 15) Be positive and give an appropriate witness to young ones, with the hope that they too may become praisers of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">introductions will equip you to assist many people during November.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> As we come closer to the end of this system of things, many more individuals with questions will no doubt be searching for answers that can be found only in God’s Word. May we be d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">iligent in offering them what they </span><span class="font10">need. Let us </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">persist</span><span class="font10"> in encouraging others to read and study God’s Word.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ American Samoa reported a new peak of 124 publishers in June, a 23-percent increase. More than 25 percent of the publishers were in pioneer work that month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ An all-time peak of 35,797 publishers was reached during June in Colombia. A peak of 64,266 Bible studies was also reported.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Fiji had their 42nd consecutive peak with 1,398 reporting in June. They had 2,271 studies, their 13th consecutive peak.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">Things You Have Learned </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font10">mentally, and physically. (2 Cor. 7:1) Are you ‘practicing what was learned’ in this important matter? How? We will maintain spiritual cleanness by remaining separate from this world’s unclean religions and from apostates. Disciplining of the mind is needed if we are to avoid unclean thinking habits or entertaining wrong sexual desires, which lead to mental and moral uncleanness. (Job 31:1, 9-11) Have you taken firm steps to avoid movies, TV programs, or reading matter that could have a corrupting influence on you or those in your family? It was also pointed out that some have neglected personal hygiene and tidiness at home. If any have a weakness in this area, surely adjustments can be made in personal habits to ensure physical cleanness. Every member of the family needs to cooperate to maintain the cleanness and orderliness of a household. Particularly when representing Jehovah in the ministry would we want to be neatly groomed and wear clothing that is neat, clean, and modest in appearance. We thereby honor our holy God.—1 Pet. 1:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Future issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> will remind us of still other vital aspects of divine justice that we learned about at this summer’s convention. This will be helpful to all as we put into practice these principles of righteousness in our daily lives and in our ministry. Unlike many in Christendom who listen with pleasure to the Bible’s message but do not act upon it, we derive much happiness and personal benefit from being “doers of the word, and not hearers only.”—Jas. 1:22-25; Ezek. 33:32.</span></p>

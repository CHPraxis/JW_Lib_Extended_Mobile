<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is the zealous God. (Isa. 9:7; 59:17) It is to be </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">expected</span><span class="font15"> that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">aLL </span><span class="font15">lovers of Jehovah would prove thems</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">elves to be zealous in worshipin</span><span class="font15">g him.

By heeding these reminders, we will noL</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">be halfhearted</span><span class="font15"> in our worship. (Ps. 119:113) We will imitate such zealous men as J_eim and the apostle </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Paul,</span><span class="font15"> as well as other faithful servants of God.—2 Ki. 10:16; 1 Cor. 14:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> During the month of May, we will have many fine opportunities to demonstrate zeal as we continue to </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">offer </span><span class="font15">the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">atchtower</span><span class="font15"> su</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">bscr</span><span class="font15">iption. Since 1879 </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watcfitower</span><span class="font15"> has been available on a subscription basis, and millions of people continue to benefit as regular subscribers. </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Over three mil</span><span class="font15">lio</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">n of its readers</span><span class="font15"> now enthusiastically p</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">resent t</span><span class="font15">he </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Wat^htouM&amp;s</span><span class="font15"> Biblebased message to still others. During this </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> subscription campaign, we want to use the current Topic for Conversation, “The Bible Benefits Family Life.” How can this be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">' </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">After introducing yoursel</span><span class="font15">f, you might ask: “Have you noticed that many families are finding it difficult to bear up under the pressures of life today? [Allow for reply.] While some seem to be doing quite well, many others are experiencing serious problems that range from disobedient children to child abuse and from general distrust to the breakup of marriage and family. Where do you think concerned family members can turn for trustworthy counsel and assistance? [Allow for reply. ] The one that instituted marriage, the Creator himself, gives us the best counsel on family life. Notice how Genesis 1:27, 28 states God’s purpose for the human family. [Read.] Since God instituted the arrangement, he is the One who knows what the family needs in order to achieve real happiness. We can all benefit from following God’s instructions regarding family life. [Read Isaiah 48:17, 18.] For more than a hundred years, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> has directed the attention of its readers to Bible principles that benefit family life.” Then, after calling attention to a specific point in the current issue, offer the subscription.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Children to Benefit More From Meetings</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> When your children are attending meetings, do they really listen? Can they relate to you afterward things they have learned from each meeting? Have you encouraged them to pay attention and make use of knowledge gained by careful observation? Do you set them an active pxample~5y your expressions Iff the meetings, one that they can see, hear, and imitate? Do your children </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">imitate your faith</span><span class="font15">? Positive answers to these questions are of vital importance if children are going to grow up as devoted servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Let true Christian zeal move you to speak about the message of pure worship published in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font15"> S</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">peak in a positive wa</span><span class="font15">y, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">with, </span><span class="font15">conviction, when offering the subscription. Sheeplike ones will hear the Bible message with appreciation and will respond favorably.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> As we use every appropriate occasion to make the good news known, may honesthearted ones see that we are “a people . . . zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">learn to appreciate spiritual things, meeting attendance is necessary. At t</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">imes, parents hesitate to brin</span><span class="font15">g children to meetings because they fear the child</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ren will distur</span><span class="font15">b others.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR EXAMPLE AS A PARENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">' The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> of January 15, 1982, page 17, asked the following questions: “Do your children know that y</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ou take Bible study meeting</span><span class="font15">s s</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">eriousl</span><span class="font15">y? bo they see that you consider these meetings important enough npt j</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ust for you to atten</span><span class="font15">d but for you </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">to </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">participate in</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font15"> offering comments when these are requested?” If your children see you </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">chatting unnecessarily</span><span class="font15"> during the meetings or if you or others are p</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">laying with them</span><span class="font15">, what impression will that make on them? Ho</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">w will </span><span class="font15">they view meeting times? Since children are good imitators, your example can have a profound effect on them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Some parents have found it helpful to pr</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ovid</span><span class="font15">e even small children with their o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">wn cnp</span><span class="font15">i</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">ps nf the publica</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">tions</span><span class="font15"> used at the meetings. Perhaps during the family study, they help their children prepare appropriate comments. Also, parents can encourage their children by reviewing points that were discussed during the meeting and by taking time to answer questions they may have. Parents should also be </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">alert to com</span><span class="font15"></span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">mend th</span><span class="font15">eir children for their participation in the meetings.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> It is true that this training involves h</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ard work</span><span class="font15"> for the parents.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God loves justice and righteousness. (Ps. 33:5) His servant Elihu declared: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power, and justice and abundance of righteousness he will not belittle.”—Job 37:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Truly, Jehovah God has not overlooked the injustices that have been committed in this world. Since he is a God of unchanging moral standards, we can rest assured that he will not indefinitely tolerate the lawlessness of today. (Compare Isaiah 14:3-8.) In fact, Bible prophecy points to our time as the last days for this ungodly world. So we need to show by our works that we love righteousness and divine justice and that we keep ourselves separate from the condemned practices of this world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses are looking forward to the “Divine Justice” District Conventions that are scheduled for 1988. A listing of 119 conventions in the United States was provided in the February 15, 1988, issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font15"> At district conventions we are truly taught by Jehovah. We attend with the mental disposition manifested in the inspired prayer at Psalm 119:33: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last.” Surely, these words express the feelings of all of Jehovah’s dedicated servants today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> PROGRAM FROM KEY CITIES: </span><span class="font15">Just as in 1983, arrangements have been made for conventions to be tied in by telephone line to a key city. In each of the six successive weeks that conventions are scheduled, those attending in Alaska, Bermuda, Canada, Hawaii, and the contiguous United States will benefit from talks given by members of the Governing Body. When you attend your convention, you will learn which is the key city when the program comes through. There is no need to write to the Society about this matter. Arrangements have also been made for missionaries to visit their home country and attend a district convention with their family and friends. A special part on the program will deal with the activities of the missionaries. At a number of conventions, missionaries will be invited to share their experiences with us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> ATTEND ALL SESSIONS: </span><span class="font15">The “Divine Justice” District Conventions will last four days. Have you made plans to be in attendance at all the sessions? From the opening session on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. until the concluding prayer at approximately 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, important information essential to our spiritual health will be presented. A different aspect of divine justice will be highlighted each day. The program will include talks, demonstrations, and dramas. Therefore, do not miss even one session. It is appreciated that this may require you to make some personal sacrifices and adjustments in your schedule.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">You may have to make some arrangements with your employer so as to attend the convention. If you make the matter a subject of sincere prayer and put forth heartfelt effort to be there, Jehovah will certainly bless you.—Matt. 5:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Endeavor to arrive early each day and to be in your seat before the sessions begin. This will give you an opportunity to enjoy Christian fellowship with brothers and sisters from other places. (Rom. 1:12) It will also allow you to join in praising Jehovah with song, which is a very important part of our worship, and to share in the opening prayer. Consider also that those sitting around you will certainly appreciate that you have not distracted their attention from the program by arriving late. Christian love and consideration, along with respect for Jehovah and the spiritual things he is providing, should motivate us to do our best to arrive on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> You have already been given information about the convention your congregation is assigned to attend. Information has also been provided regarding rooming accommodations and other arrangements for your convention. Considerable planning and work have been done to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and other provisions are available for everyone. It is understandable that circumstances may prevent a few from attending where they are assigned. Some may need to assist relatives in another area. However, wherever possible, your cooperation in attending the convention to which your congregation is assigned will help to prevent overcrowding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU HEAR: “The </span><span class="font15">sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings, as silver refined in a smelting furnace of earth, clarified seven times.” (Ps. 12:6) Many of God’s “pure sayings” will be heard at this “Divine Justice” District Convention. The information presented will not be a general message for the curious listener but will be special information for Jehovah’s people, for those who are dedicated to him, who want to please him, who ‘tremble at his word.’ (Isa. 66:5) Of all people on earth, we are highly favored to be taught by Jehovah.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> Listening means really paying attention with both our mind and our heart, with our ears and our powers of understanding. We need to listen and hear “the word of Jehovah.” (Jer. 2:4) What we hear will include accurate knowledge to expand our understanding and deepen our appreciation. We will hear information to build our faith and strengthen our hope. We will receive counsel and discipline lovingly provided for our benefit. A great deal of time has been used to research and prepare the program. Therefore, it is essential that we listen and be awake to what Jehovah’s Word is telling us. We can thus</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1988</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">benefit personally and so be able to use this information to help others.—Prov. 18:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> Since our primary purpose for attending the convention is to receive spiritual direction and encouragement, plan to arrive early enough to take care of matters that need attention, such as obtaining convention food tickets, and then be seated before the program begins. Doing this will leave you relaxed, with your mind uncluttered with concern over matters not directly related to the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> Be sure to get a good night’s sleep each night so that you will be refreshed in the morning and can fully concentrate on the program during the day. Although convention time affords a fine opportunity to renew friendships and to enjoy pleasant association, if we stay up late into the night visiting with friends, we may not be alert to benefit fully from the program the next day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>12</sup> It is suggested that good judgment be used as to the items we bring to the convention site. In the past, some have brought large coolers or other bulky items that could not be placed under their seat. These have been placed in aisleways or on seats. We need to show consideration in such matters, since this has resulted in depriving brothers and interested persons of a seat and, in most instances, has violated fire and safety codes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> BAPTISM: </span><span class="font15">The talk to baptismal candidates will be given on Saturday morning. Baptism is the outward symbol that one has dedicated himself without reservation to Jehovah God. This part of the program is always one of the highlights of a district convention. All of us benefit by listening carefully and reflecting on our own relationship with Jehovah. Additionally, we share the joy of those being baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>14</sup> Those planning to be baptized at one of the district conventions should be sure to inform the presiding overseer well in advance of the convention so that there will be plenty of time to review the questions in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font15"> book. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.—See </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font15">May 1987, page 3, paragraph 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>15</sup> Baptismal candidates should endeavor to be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to baptismal candidates and then call for a song. All will stand during the singing of the song. Before the last verse has been sung, the attendants will direct the baptismal candidates to the immersion site or to vehicles that will take them there, while the rest of the audience completes singing the song.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> TAKE NOTES: </span><span class="font15">Besides your Bible and songbook, remember to bring a notepad and pen or pencil. We may not be in the habit of taking notes during weekly congregation meetings because most of the talks and demonstrations are taken from material that is available to all in the congregation. However, listening to the information presented at the district convention is an entirely different matter. While some of the talks will in time appear in the publications, others will not. Even if all the talks were to appear in print, there are still significant benefits to be derived from taking brief, meaningful notes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>17</sup> For one thing, taking notes serves as an aid to concentration. Isolate the speaker’s key points and key scriptures or new thoughts that may be presented. Then make brief notes of these. Usually a sentence or two will suffice for a key point. By following this suggestion, your concentration will unquestionably improve. You will be less likely to let your mind drift or be distracted. You will also be equipped to benefit from the review of the convention highlights with your congregation the following week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>18</sup> Will you have young children or teenagers with you? Then why not arrange for them also to take notes in accord with their age and ability? Let the family know that you plan to review some of the main points brought out by the speakers when you return to your place of lodging or while you are traveling home. Younger children can be encouraged to write down all the scripture citations or note how many times they hear a speaker refer to key words or the theme of the talk. By doing this, they will get much more from the talks. It is good for children to learn to pay close attention at Christian meetings. You will be helping them to build a solid foundation for the -future.—Deut. 31:12; Eph. 6:4. /TVixJ /-&quot;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;-</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> FINE CONDUCT: </span><span class="font15">Each year at the conclusion of our district conventions, we receive favorable com- _ ments about the oi-derliness and good conduct that' </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">f. </span><span class="font15">was in evidence. Observers often remark about the peat </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">appearance</span><span class="font15"> of adults and children alike, not to mention the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">peace and unity</span><span class="font15"> of the brothers while attending the convention. The year 1987 was no exception. But why do we mention this? Because it is encouraging to know that when we set a fine example, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">it is observe</span><span class="font15">d</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">^</span><span class="font15">anj</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span><span class="font15"> a</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ppreciated</span><span class="font15"> b</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">y others.</span><span class="font15"> (1 Pet.^ 2:12) More importantly, though, it b</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">rings praise to God.</span><span class="font15"> We want to honor Jehovah in word and deed, and since p</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">eople</span><span class="font15"> may j</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">udge</span><span class="font15"> the o</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">rganizatio</span><span class="font15">n and even the God we worship by our conduct, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">we want to be ever </span><span class="font15">c</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">onscious o</span><span class="font15">f how we acL</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>20</sup> There are a number of areas to which we will need to give attention in order tcvshine as illuminators! fully, especially when we are away from the convention grounds, such </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">as at restaurant</span><span class="font15">s(an&lt;) </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">motels.—</span><span class="font15">Phil. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>21</sup> First, how are we doing in the matter of </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">unnecessary seat saving? Improvement</span><span class="font15"> has been noted in this regard, and for this we commend you. However, we still n</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">eed to pay attention</span><span class="font15"> to this matter, since some do abuse the arrangement. Please keep in mind that </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">SEATS MAY RR SAVFD ONLY</span><span class="font15"> FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR. It is only natural to want to sit near the ones with whom we came, and it is expected that immediate family members would sit together. But </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">please</span><span class="font15"> do not reserve seats for others. Oftentimes friends locate seats on their own, and the extra ones saved are not used. We can show appreciation for the convention and consideration for others by following these directions.—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>22</sup> As dedicated servants, our conduct should be fine </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">AT ALL TIMES</span><span class="font15">. Exemplary conduct becomes especially noteworthy at large gatherings, and Jehovah’s name is glorified by such conduct. However, poor conduct and thoughtlessness on the part of just a few can bring reproach on Jehovah’s name and on his people. </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Reports</span><span class="font15"> have been received that a few brothers and their </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">families have used poor judgmen</span><span class="font15">t in their use of </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">motel facilities</span><span class="font15">. </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Recreation seems to b</span><span class="font15">e </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">foremost on the mind of a few</span><span class="font15">, so they leave the convention before the program has concluded in order </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">to be first</span><span class="font15"> at the swimming pool. Some Witness </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">children have not had proper supervision</span><span class="font15"> and have been very unruly. The spirit of the world becomes manifest among a few when they return to their accommodations. Some not only </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">change into immod</span><span class="font15">e</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">st and faddish attire</span><span class="font15">fbufy </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font15"> change their </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">conduct</span><span class="font15">. At the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">convention,</span><span class="font15"> we^e clearly what the Christian personality should be, but some, after leaving the convention site, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">seem to forget</span><span class="font15"> what they saw and heard on the program. (Jas. 1:22-24) Our presence at the convention and elsewhere, as well as our conduct and grooming, bear fitness </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">abo</span><span class="font15">ut u^ and the God we worship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">-MZxXK</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>23</sup> Of course, when the convention program is over, many </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">enjoy getting together for a meal</span><span class="font15"> and association. This c</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">an be delightfu</span><span class="font15">l and the time can be well spent in good conversation as we share experiences and review the convention highlights. It brings pleasure to us and glory to our God Jehovah as we ‘‘behave in a manner worthy of the good news?) —Phil. 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>21</sup> A final kindly reminder has to do with </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">visiting </span><span class="font15">ancTjtalkmg during the sessions. Obviously, we are ~glad to see friends at th6 cdiivention, but respect for Jehovah and consideration for our brothers should be foremost in mind. Hence, we would </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">not want to be </span><span class="font15">di</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">sturbing or distracting others during the program</span><span class="font15">. If you have to leave your seat for some important reason, do it as quickly and quietly as possible. Also, while the p</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">rogram is on, no one should be visiting in the corridor</span><span class="font15">s. We are there to listen and to learn. —Luke 8:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>25</sup> FOOD NEEDS: As mentioned in the January 1988 </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font15"> insert, the Society has </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">simplified the food servic</span><span class="font15">e arrangement at the district conventions by e</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">liminating hot foods</span><span class="font15"> and serving </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">only cold food items</span><span class="font15"> along with </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">hot and cold </span><span class="font15">b</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">everage</span><span class="font15">s. This enables more of our brothers and sisters who work in food preparation to join us in the audience and benefit from all the spiritual food presented. We appreciate very much the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">willingnes</span><span class="font15">s of those who volunteer to serve us at district conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>26</sup> All attending the convention will find the food available to be satisfactory and nourishing, giving good variety for four days. Great care has been taken to buy food of the highest quality. Y</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">our fully utilizing </span><span class="font15">the p</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">rovisions</span><span class="font15"> available through the Food Service Department will </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">support the convention operatio</span><span class="font15">n.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font15">The emphasis on simplification is particularly noted in connection with the man-hours needed to organize and operate a district convention. Those who have been in the truth many years will recall that </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">previously,</span><span class="font15"> before and during large conventions, t</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ens of thousands of volunteers </span><span class="font15">were </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">neede</span><span class="font15">d, devoting </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">many hours</span><span class="font15"> of their time in various convention departments. That labor of love was deeply appreciated, but it o</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ften caused many</span><span class="font15"> of the volunteers t</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">o miss</span><span class="font15"> a great deal of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>21</sup> While fewer volunteers and fewer hours are now required to do the work, vol</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">unteer help is still neede</span><span class="font15">d for the smooth operation of a district convention. Can you have a share? </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">No one should feel that volunteer</span><span class="font15">i</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng will mean missing</span><span class="font15"> most of the program as some have experienced in the past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>29</sup> When you arrive at the convention site, check with the Volunteer Service Department. Even if you may be able to </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">work for only a nart</span><span class="font15"> of the convention, your services will be appreciated. You will find it </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">spiritually rewarding to</span><span class="font15"> work at the convention. Children </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">under 16 y</span><span class="font15">earsof age can also contribute to the success of the convention, but they are required to work </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">with a narent</span><span class="font15">,</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">_pr a guardiqn.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> RECORDINGS: </span><span class="font15">It seems timely to clarify the Society’s position on the use of video cameras as well as </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">audio equipmen</span><span class="font15">t. A consistent </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">policy</span><span class="font15"> is desirable for </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">all meetings</span><span class="font15">—district conventions, circuit assemblies, special assembly days, a</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd in Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font15">s. While there is no prohibition on the use of such equipment, it seems there m</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ust be control</span><span class="font15">s and limitations. Attendants should be alert that those who use video cameras and audio recorders </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">do not disturb others or distract</span><span class="font15"> attention from the program in progress. Brothers using such equipment should co</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">operate with the attendjmts</span><span class="font15"> and elders having oversight and not be pleasing themselves. Such equipment should not be set up in aisles or exits. No such equipment should be connected to the public address system or electrical outlets, nor will </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">floodlights</span><span class="font15"> be permitted. In some cases, such equipment can be set up where it will not disturb the audience, such as in the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">back of halls</span><span class="font15">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>31</sup> CONCLUSION: There are good reasons why we want to be at the “Divine Justice” District Convention where we can worship Jehovah with thousands of our brothers. Also, conventions are spiritual feasts that strengthen our faith and deepen our appreciation for the truth. The prophet Isaiah declared that Jehovah’s servants/’will not go hungry, neither will they go thirsty, nor will parching jjgat or sun strike them. For the One who is having pity upon them will lead them, and by the springs of water he will conduct them.” C[sa. 49^10J Truly, Jehovah’s people do not hunger spiritually or thirst for truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Neither does the scorching heat of God’s fiery judgments fall upon us. We know how good the spiritual provisions taste and how nourishing they are. That is why we rejoice at the opportunity to assemble together this summer for the “Divine Justice” District Conventions.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font15">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention is very much appreciated. If you have not already confirmed a reservation, please do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. If you find it necessary to cancel your reservation for accommodations, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you have made duplicate reservations with the idea of selecting preferred accommodations upon arrival, please cancel immediately what you do not actually intend to use. (Matt. 5:37) We should work what is good toward all and not engage in worldly practices that could damage bur reputation and relationship with motel managers who are giving us special rates.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon request, available information on any commercial trailer or camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font15">In many states, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Fire, </span><span class="font15">regul</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ations</span><span class="font15"> prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, b</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">aby strollers are </span><span class="font15">potent</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ially dangerous</span><span class="font15"> not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them, so please do not bring them to the convention site. However, car or infant seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font15">It is the course of wisdom and shows respectful appreciation if we are in our seats when the program begins. In all convention cities, the program on Thursday </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">will begin at 1:30 p</span><span class="font15">.m. with music, then song’ and prayer, and sessions will </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">con</span><span class="font15">clude by 5:1</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">0 p.m. I</span><span class="font15">n the Central and Mountain time zones, the program on Friday will begin at 9:20 a.m. and conclude at 4:40 p.m. On Saturday it will begin at 9:20 a.m. and conclude at 4:55 p.m. In the Eastern time zone, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">the program on F</span><span class="font15">riday and Saturday will b</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Sgin at</span><span class="font15"> 10:20 am and conclude at 5-40 pm on Friday a nd 5-^5 p n;</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">, on Saturday</span><span class="font15">.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GILEAD AND BETHEL MEETINGS: </span><span class="font15">A meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday, for any dedicated publishers and pioneers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter B</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ethel </span><span class="font15">service. Announcements will be made at the co’nven-tion regarding the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font15">All </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font15"> and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">special </span><span class="font15">pioneers, as well as traveling overseers, will need to bring their </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Watchtower Iden</span><span class="font15">tification and Assign</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ment card (S-202) to the convention</span><span class="font15">. Pioneers Oh the list tor at least six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $20 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at that one convention only. Therefore, treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention.

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question Box</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">• Why acquire a personal library?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One fundamental reason is that personal study is important to Jehovah’s Witnesses. (John 17:3) It is a convenience to have a library at home in order to do research, answer questions, and prepare for Christian meetings. We should not underestimate the value of having easy access to reliable Scriptural information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Another reason for having a home library is related to the fact that each Christian must “carry his own load” of responsibility. (Gal. 6:5) When questions arise, it is good to have the habit of first doing our own research and only then asking questions of others if necessary. We can develop our powers of discernment and understanding by being diligent students of God’s Word and making good use of a home library.—Heb. 5: 11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some children have been assisted by their parents to build their own personal library, having in mind both present and future needs. No doubt about it, a good personal library is a valuable possession in a Christian home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">include c</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">urrent publications of the Society</span><span class="font15"> and a variety ot </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible trans</span><span class="font15"></span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">lations</span><span class="font15">. Also, a </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">good dictionary</span><span class="font15"> may be provided. (See Question Box, May 1972 </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.)</span><span class="font15"> The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Index </span><span class="font15">which is designed for research and study, is an essential item in a good theocratic library. However, many Kingdom Halls do not have all the publications referred to in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span><span class="font15"> In order to make more material available, the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">Society is planning tn reprint</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"> The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> bound volumes for the years </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">1960 to 1979,</span><span class="font15"> in English only.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Joy</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ fnunrl groat joy in his ministry. For him, doing his Father’s will was his food.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THINK IN TERMS OF HELPING PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Jesus Christ and Paul were excellent teachers. They </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">aimed</span><span class="font15"> to rea</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ch the heart</span><span class="font15">s of those who listened. Many did not respond, but those who did were a real cause for joy. (Phil. 4:1; compare Luke 15:7.) Yes, helping people to learn of Jehovah and seeing them take a stand for the truth makes us happy. In the first century, “the conversion of people of the nations” was a cause for “great joy to all the brothers.” —Acts 15:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> You too can experience this joy by skillfully sharing what you know with others. Jehovah’s organization has provided excellent tnnls to assist us as we teach others the truth. For example, we have the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Topic</span><span class="font15"> for Conversation found in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font15"> There is also the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Reason</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">ng</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;"> hook</span><span class="font15">, which has many appealing introductions and answers to important questions that people ask.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAIN IN GOOD CONDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> The s</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">chool oversee</span><span class="font15">r will arrange a </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">periodic check</span><span class="font15"> of the library to see that it is in good order and that any repairs or replacements are cared for. Feel free to use any of the publications in the library before and after the meetings. However, no to help people get on the road to salvation by </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">being w</span><span class="font15">ell prepared </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">to initiate</span><span class="font15"> goodconvdl'satluns With them. Such may lead to productive Bible studies and greater joy in our service.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Whether you are serving as a publisher or a pioneer, keep in mind the purpose of the ministry. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) The preaching of the good news for a witness is an a</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ssignment from God</span><span class="font15">. It is a privilege, and we should appreciate that what Jehovah asks of his servants is n</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot burdensome,</span><span class="font15"> (1 John 5:3) He wants his people to enjoy his service. Consequently, even though some may not respond favorably to the preaching work, you can still have much joy in the ministry. Why is this so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Jesus’ disciples found great joy in their ministry, and he explained to them what their principal reason for joy should be. (Luke 10:17-20) Those of the “great crowd,” who have earthly hopes, also have every reason to rejoice. (Rev. 7:9, 10) Whether your hope be heavenly or earthly, the fact that you are doing God’s will should give you great joy becaus^’your labor is </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">not in vain</span><span class="font15"> in connection with the Lord.”J(l Cor. 15:58) Jehovah “is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.” (Heb. 6:10) Serving Jehovah w</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">hole-</span><span class="font15">souled is a sourc</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">e of iov</span><span class="font15"> for those who love him.—Ps. 40:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;"> A Christian should enjoy his service to God</span><span class="font15">. Continue to find joy in the ministry, assured that J</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ehovah </span><span class="font15">appreciates even </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">the smallest act'of </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">ge.nnine d</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">vot</span><span class="font15">i</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:line-through;">on</span><span class="font15">. (Compare Mark 12:41-44.) May all of us continue to ’glorify our ministry’ and experience the joy it brings.—Rom. 11:13.</span></p></li></ul>

If there is some exceptional need, then the matter should be discussed with the school overseer. When more than one congregation meets in a Kingdom Hall, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">each congregation should have its own Theocratic Ministry School library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“ The Theocratic Ministry School library serves a very beneficial purpose. As we take advantage of this provision to do research, we can have the </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">joy of uncovering the ‘hi</span><span class="font15">d</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">den treasur</span><span class="font15">es' ot God’s Word that </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">give</span><span class="font15"> kno</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">wledge</span><span class="font15">, </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">wisdom</span><span class="font15">, and </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">undei^ </span><span class="font15">standing —Prov. 2:4-6.</span></p>

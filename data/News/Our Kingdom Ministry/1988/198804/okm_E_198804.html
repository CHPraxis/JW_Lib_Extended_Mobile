<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible Benefits Family Life. Gen. 1:27, 28—God instituted the family arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 48:17, 18—Family members benefit from heeding God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NotMissing the Purpose of Our Field Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In many areas today a publisher may spend an hour or more in the field ministry without having an opportunity to witness to anyone or place any literature. Perhaps few people are at home, or when someone is found at home he may tell us he has his own religion and is not interested in changing. Another may say: “You are doing a fine work, but my religion supplies me with all the literature I need.” When this happens, do we just say “Thank you” and proceed to the next door, or do we at least attempt to explain the purpose of our call?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus met with similar problems in his ministry. When certain disciples of the Pharisees said: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth,” he unhesitatingly gave such an effective witness that they marveled at what he said. He did not allow their flattery to deter him from giving a bold witness. —Matt. 22:15-22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE URGENT NOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Some day we will make our last call on the people in our territory. Every time we engage in the field ministry, we should do so with that thought in mind. (2 Cor. 6:2; Isa. 55:6) People must be warned that Jehovah’s “day of vengeance” is near, and they must be helped to find the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Others Appreciate Spiritual Things</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a heartwarming occasion the Memorial proves to be! Each year we are reminded of the value of Christ Jesus’ sacrifice in behalf of all mankind. This very special celebration affords us the opportunity to help new ones appreciate more fully the spiritual things God has provided through his beloved Son. (Mark 9:7) How can we help those who attend the Memorial to associate regularly with the congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Undoubtedly, the majority who attend the Memorial, even for the first time, recognize in themselves a spiritual hunger that needs to be filled. (Matt. 5:3) What can we do to stimulate them to seek ways to care for this need?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One thing would be to call on them as soon as possible. Show a personal interest and offer to help them make spiritual progress. Many who attend the Memorial do not have a personal home Bible study. Help them to understand that in order to benefit fully from Christ Jesus’ sacrifice and have only way of survival.—Isa. 61:1, 2; Ezek. 33:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When presenting the current literature offer, doing magazine work, or making a return visit, do not hold back from speaking the truth with dignity, tact, and good manners. Always show proper respect for the householder, and at the same time, do all you reasonably can to help the householder understand the purpose of your call.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCOMPLISHINGOUR PURPOSE IN APRIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Your opening words are very important. What you say in your introduction often determines whether you will capture the person’s attention and be able to continue the conversation. What are some of the common objections in your area? It may be advisable to raise one of these in your introduction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> For example, if the people in your territory are religiously inclined and the territory is worked frequently, you might say: “You probably recognize that we are Jehovah's Witnesses. If you personally are associated with one of the churches in the area, you may wonder why we call so often. [Allow for comment.] One serious problem that concerns us is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font11"> 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s approval, a regular study is needed. Endeavor to make arrangements for such a spiritual feeding program at their convenience.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If you make a visit the week following the Memorial and endeavor to arrange for a Bible study, at the same time you can extend a warm invitation to the special talk on April 10, “Why Live by Bible Standards?” Offer to accompany them to the Kingdom Hall, providing transportation if needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EXTEND THE INVITATION TO WITNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> What about those who are studying already and perhaps attending meetings on a regular basis? What further progress do they need to make? Have you suggested that they try to witness to their friends, relatives, workmates, and others on an informal basis? This will help them to progress spiritually. They will be showing their gratitude for Jesus’ </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page k, col. 2}</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>What Are Your Plans for April?</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The month of April begins a period of increased field service activity for many of us. In some areas the weather has moderated and is more favorable for staying out in the field service for longer periods of time. April usually proves to be an ideal month for setting personal goals of increased activity in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What field service arrangements has your congregation made for April? Will there be additional meetings for field service, including evening witnessing? Will you be able to adjust your schedule so as to take advantage of these arrangements and work with others in the field service? Can you temporarily set aside other activity that is less important?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In addition to making calls on those who attend the Memorial, April would also be a good time for a renewed effort to locate interested persons who have been too busy to talk</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> First and foremost, we have the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible</span><span class="font11"> as our m</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain textbook</span><span class="font11">- A fine B</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ible-reading program</span><span class="font11"> has been sc</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">heduled</span><span class="font11"> for each week. Are we keeping up with it? Is there a need to set aside time in our personal schedule for this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Is anything else needed, or is reading the Bible enough? (Jas. 1: 5, 6) We also </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">need the v</span><span class="font11">isible organi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">zation</span><span class="font11"> that Jehovah is using to supply us regularly with an abundance of spiritual food.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Another of Jehovah’s provisions for theocratic education is that of loving </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">shepherd</span><span class="font11">s.

Conscientious overseers study diligently to keep abreast of the organization. (2 Tim. 2:15) They recognize that they have a serious responsibility before Jehovah to feed and protect the flock. All of us can benefit from their experience and the time they spend in our behalf.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> I</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">nstructing our children</span><span class="font11"> in the trutliTs an especially Important aspect of theocratic education.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Ne\yer ones</span><span class="font11"> can be helped to appreciate the value of the time they set aside for their weekly Bible study. We should en</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">courag</span><span class="font11">e them to be </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">well prepared</span><span class="font11"> for each study. Right from the beginning we want them to be thoroughly “taught the word.” (Gal. 6:6) If we do our part in teaching them, it will not be long before they will be eagerly participating with us in the evangelizing work. Theocratic education does not stop when they learn “the elementary things.” (Heb. 5:12-6:3) We want tO hel</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">p th</span><span class="font11">em “press On tn maturity &quot;&nbsp;This takes time.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> These are </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">only a few of Jehovah's provisio</span><span class="font11">ns for teaching us what we need. O</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ther provisions</span><span class="font11"> are the circuit overseer's visit, the Pioneer </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ser-</span><span class="font11">viceJSchaoj, and the K</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ingdom Minis</span><span class="font11">t</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ry School.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> All thanks are due Jehovah for providing the only education that will protect and guide us through these final days.

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• Should pioneers obtain literature for family members at pioneer rates?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is good to keep in mind why the Society makes it possible for pioneers to obtain literature at a reduced cost. This is a loving provision of the Society, at its expense, to help pioneers defray some of their expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Accordingly, all publishers who are members of a pioneer’s household and who are not pioneers, whether children or adults, should obtain their literature and magazines for field service at the regular publisher rates.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>By Using Tracts at Every Opportunity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some plants may produce hundreds or even thousands of seeds. In this way, Jehovah ensured that such plant life would always flourish on earth.—Gen. 1:29, 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Similarly, in his great generosity, Jehovah makes the seed of Kingdom truth abundant not only in the mouths of his devoted servants but also in the form of the printed page. Think of the hundreds of millions of books, booklets, magazines, and brochures that have been distributed over the years. Last year a new set of tracts was produced. Are we using the tracts to spread the good news at every opportunity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In order to use the tracts effectively, we need to familiarize ourselves with them. Note that they are colorful and are printed on durable paper. Their handy size makes it convenient to carry some with us wherever we go. Most importantly, the Bible-based message in each tract is clear, to the point, and persuasive. Do you see the many opportunities there are to make use of them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> House-to-House Work: </span><span class="font11">Many publishers find that offering a free tract in their introduction opens the way for a conversation with the householder. You may wish to try this with the current Topic for Conversation, using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible.</span><span class="font11"> During a discussion at a door, you may learn that the person recently lost a loved one in death. How appropriate it would be to share the comforting message contained in the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font11"> Or the conversation may reveal that the person has some misconceptions about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe. The tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</span><span class="font11"> may be just what is needed. Often the householder is willing to accept a tract even if the literature offer is refused. We do not know what effect one tract may have on that person or on others in his household who may read it.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Informal Witnessing: </span><span class="font11">During the course of our daily routine, we may have contact with any number of worldly persons. Wherever we are, the tracts help us to be prepared to give a witness. Opportunity for a brief oral witness can be enhanced by offering a tract for the person to read later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> At your workplace, do workmates or others speak about the pressures and problems of living in this system of things? Would they like to know what has given you a hope for the future? If they truly are “sighing and groaning” over the world’s unrighteous conditions, the information in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font11"> will strike a responsive chord in their hearts, opening the way for further discussion.—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Do you young ones at school hear teachers or fellow students question the reliability of the Bible? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible</span><span class="font11"> contains a faithbuilding message showing the scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible that may stimulate their interest in learning more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Jesus said that our field for witnessing is the entire inhabited earth. (Matt. 13:38; 24:14) Thus, wherever there are people—at work, at school, in the waiting room of a doctor or a dentist, at the Laundromat or where we shop, at the homes of relatives or neighbors, or even at our own door when people stop for various reasons—let us take every opportunity to spread the seeds of Kingdom good news, trusting that some of these will fall on “fine soil” and result in further fruitage to Jehovah’s praise.—Matt. 13:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The Bible student may hesitate to speak with others, thinking they will not listen to the truth. He may need to learn that each individual is important to God, who sees the heart and knows when someone is ready to accept the good news. Help your student to realize that it is God’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4; Acts 17:26, 27) Show him that Jesus Christ was sent by God to give himself as “a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matt. 20:28) If your student can be helped to appreciate this, he will see why he should try to talk about the truth to everyone whenever he has the opportunity. His personal conviction will be strengthened, and he will have the joy that comes from giving of the most valuable treasure he possesses. —Gal. 6:6; Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>

Although you may have already made several attempts to give a further witness, why not look through your records and call on these individuals again in an endeavor to renew their interest in the good news? Perhaps evening calls would be productive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Many brothers and sisters have arranged to auxiliary pioneer this April. These include some with family responsibilities and even some with full-time secular jobs. The 60-hour requirement means an average of only 2 hours per day for the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> If circumstances do not allow you to auxiliary pioneer during April, it may be possible for you to increase your field service activity by spending some time in the field with the pioneers or with others who are also endeavoring to increase their ministry for the month. You can be assured that Jehovah will bless your efforts. By his spirit he will give you strength to reach your goal.—Prov. 20:18; 21:5a.</span></p></li></ul>

Truly, all of us are greatly privileged to be sharing in a lifesaving work in imitation of our Savior, Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By fulfilling the commission to preach, we will all be heeding the counsel given by the apostle Paul: “Working together with him, we also entreat you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.”—2 Cor. 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> We do not know how many more will yet come to appreciate the privilege of serving Jehovah. But we are assured that by continuing to help others appreciate spiritual things we will receive grand blessings, and so will they.—2 Cor. 6:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings Incite to Fine Works</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Two essential features of our worship are attending congregation meetings and sharing in field service. The two go hand in hand. One influences the other. Christian meetings incite to fine works, the finest of which is the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. (Heb. 10: 24) If we were to quit attending meetings, we might soon cease to preach because we would not be incited to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> At weekly meetings, we receive spiritual instruction designed to motivate us to preach. The urgency of the times is kept before us, impelling us to take the Bible’s life-giving message to others. We are encouraged and strengthened to endure in the preaching work. (Matt. 24:13,14) By taking advantage of opportunities to comment at the meetings, we become more accustomed to expressing our faith before others. (Heb. 10:23) By enrolling in the Theocratic Ministry School, we receive training to be more effective ministers and to improve our teaching skills. —2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How Service Meetings Incite Us to Preach: </span><span class="font12">All of us are encouraged to look over the material in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font12">ahead of time. This information is then impressed on our minds as we attend the Service Meeting and see presentations demonstrated from the platform. When in field service, we can think back on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> recall the presentations that were demonstrated, and thereby give a more effective witness. This has been the experience of many publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As a follow-up to Service Meetings, some make appointments with others to share together in the ministry. Publishers have field points fresh in mind and are stimulated to try them out because these meetings have encouraged them to have a share in the preaching work each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There is no substitute for our Christian meetings, where we gather with fellow worshipers and are incited to fine works. If our ministry is to flourish, we must regularly attend the congregation meetings. May we show appreciation for this wonderful provision from Jehovah by “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.”—Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Older Ones Preach Without Letup</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As people grow older, many of them focus on retiring from their regular secular work and enjoying a carefree life during their remaining years. They may feel that they have worked hard enough and now deserve a rest. Or they may just want to enjoy life, whatever is left of it.—Luke 12:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s dedicated servants, we have a different focus on life. We know there is no retirement from God’s service. Our outlook is positive because we keep “everlasting life in view.” (Jude 21) Years of accumulated knowledge and experience may improve a person’s discernment and insight. This could enable one to become wiser and more balanced and to manifest a deeper appreciation for life. All these attributes serve one well as a minister of the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Growing old is not just a matter of physical aging; it also involves one’s mental attitude. If you expect to live a long time and you strive to stay young in your outlook, your chances of doing both may increase. Older people can enrich their lives by increasing their spiritual knowledge and sharing it with others. —1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Real-Life Examples: </span><span class="font12">At the age of 86, one sister said: “When I meditate on the 60 years that have gone by since I learned the truth, God’s reassuring promise wells up in my heart. Yes, Jehovah who will act in loyalty with loyal ones is letting us reap bountiful joy.” (Ps. 18:25) One elderly brother recalled how the death of his wife came as a severe shock to him, after which his health deteriorated badly. He said: “Yet, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, I revived sufficiently to be able to enter the pioneer service two years later. How grateful I am to Jehovah that my health has actually improved with this increase in preaching activity!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> How commendable it is that so many older ones are determined to continue preaching to whatever extent their health and strength permit—without letup! They have good reason to exclaim: “O God, you have taught me from my youth on, and until now I keep telling about your wonderful works.” —Ps. 71:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Get the Best out of School</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘This is the time of year when many youths ask: “Do I have to go back to school already?” Although there may be some challenges and anxieties associated with returning to school, there are also many benefits to be gained by young people who apply themselves so as to get the best out of their education.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A good basic education can contribute to one’s spiritual progress. What a person does during his youth has a great bearing on what he can accomplish as an adult. Even in the matter of schooling, “whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (Gal. 6:7) Youths who diligently study their school lessons can acquire skills that will make them more useful to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Careful forethought is required if one is to make the right choices of school courses. Parents should help their children select the ones that offer the most practical training in order to reach spiritual goals in life. By developing their skills, youths will have the advantage of being able to support themselves in the pioneer work. Their basic education should help them to praise Jehovah no matter where they serve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Young people, try to get the best out of your school years. In doing so, focus on living a full life in sacred service, rather than on pursuing a worldly career. Endeavor to use your life doing Jehovah’s will. Thereby, you will make your way successful, to Jehovah’s praise.—Ps. 1:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Many brothers and sisters show outstanding zeal and support for Jehovah’s organization by volunteering their time and assets in Kingdom Hall construction.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> There is an ongoing need for Kingdom Hall ^construction worldwide. During just the last ser’ vice year, 3,288 new congregations were formed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Many of these congregations are in Africa, Asia, ,Central and South America, and Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Previous issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> have reported on the progress of Kingdom Hall construction in a number of lands.

While much work has been done, there continues to be a need. We feel sure that the congregations in the United States would like to assist many of these congregations in other countries to have suitable Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> This is ip harmony with gj</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Corinthians 8:1</span><span class="font12">4, which says: (“By means of an equalizing your surplus just now might offset their deficiency.” JVlany countries have their own Kingdom Hall Fund, but their economic situation does not permit the local brothers to carry the load of building Kingdom Halls as needed. However^with help from brothers') in other lands, the Society has been able to help/, build 413 new Kingdom Halls and remodel 727 oth-\ ers in just a four-month period in 75 different^ countries. In view of the continuing demand, there is a need to draw on the Kingdom Hall Fund in this/; country to assist with construction in other coun- </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a </span><span class="font12">tries.

The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregations should begin requesting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1998 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font12"> with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Albanian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ From August 28, 1997, to August 30, 1997, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">“Do All Things for the Sake of the Good News” is the theme of the new special assembly day program starting in September. (1 Cor. 9:23) The Kingdom good news is the most important news heard today. The program will help us appreciate the unique privilege we have to be bearers of this wonderful news. It will also embolden us to keep declaring the good news without letup. —Acts 5:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The program will show us how to utilize our theocratic training fully so that we can accomplish the most in the ministry. We will hear from some who have made adjustments to expand their' service, including young people who are giving their all to further the good news. —Compare Philippians 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The principal talk, to be delivered by a guest speaker, will emphasize the need for us to remain “fit to be entrusted with the good news.” (1 Thess. 2:4) We will be helped to see that if we are to retain the privilege of sharing the good news with others, we must continually measure up to God’s requirements and standards in our thinking and conduct. The blessings that we receive from doing this will also be highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do not miss this vital program. Newly dedicated ones who wish to get baptized at the special assembly day should inform the presiding overseer immediately. Invite all with whom you study to attend. Let us allow Jehovah to fortify us to do all things for the sake of the good news and thus complete the greatest work this side of Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Rely on Jehovah to Make Things Grow</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “I experienced for the first time the unique joy of helping to establish a new congregation. This took more than two years of diligent work, constant prayers and reliance on Jehovah who ‘makes things grow.’ ” So wrote a conscientious pioneer who learned the need to rely on Jehovah for growth. (1 Cor. 3:5-9) In our search for spiritually inclined people, we too have need of God’s backing if our ministry is to bear fruit.—Prov. 3: 5,6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Growth Requires Cultivation: </span><span class="font12">The seed of truth needs to be cultivated if it is to grow. Calling again within a day or two of the initial visit often produces good results. Be warm and friendly. Put the other person at ease. Do not do all the talking. Allow him to get to know you, and show that you are interested in him as a person.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’During July and continuing through August, we are concentrating on offering a variety of brochures to the people we meet. However, we also need to follow through on the interest that is found and on the placements that are made. We do this by making return visits and offering Bible studies. (Matt. 28:19,20) To this end, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure may be used to start studies. You may find the following four suggestions helpful.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you talked with someone who was concerned about the way the world is headed, you might renew the conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “I believe that you are as concerned as I am about the moral breakdown in human society. We hear distressing reports of domestic violence, resulting in abuse to children, parents, and marriage mates. And it seems that many people think nothing of lying or stealing to satisfy their own desires. Do you think it matters to God how people live their lives? [Allow for response.] God established certain standards for man to live by, and they are really not burdensome to us.” Read 1 John 5:3. Then present the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure, and open it to lesson 10. Read the first paragraph. Point out the italicized words and phrases at the beginning of paragraphs 2-6, and ask the householder which practice he or she feels is the most harmful to society. Read the related paragraph and look up one or two of the scriptures as opportunity allows. Conclude by reading paragraph 7, and then make arrangements to call back for a further discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">those whom you have met that are family oriented, you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Do you think it is reasonable to expect that the Creator would give us the tools we need to build a successful family life?” Allow for response. Introduce the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure, turn to lesson 8, and explain that it contains principles from the Bible for every member of the family. Offer to demonstrate how to use the brochure with the Bible to get the greatest benefit from it. Follow the instructions that are found on page 2 of the brochure. Make arrangements to call back to continue the study of the lesson, or if you complete it, to study another lesson that the householder chooses in the brochure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Here is a direct approach you might use to offer our Bible study program. Show the “Require” brochure, and say: </span><span class="font12">■ “This brochure contains a well-rounded-out study course covering the basic teachings of the Bible. On each page, you will find answers to questions that have troubled people for centuries. For example, What is God’s purpose for the earth?” Turn to lesson 5, and read the questions at the start of the lesson. Ask the householder which one interests him the most, and then read the corresponding paragraph(s), looking up appropriate scriptures. Explain that the satisfying answers to the other questions can be found just as easily as this one. Suggest that you return again to discuss another question and answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> Or you might prefer to try a simplified approach for starting a Bible study by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Did you know that by taking just a few minutes, you can find the answer to an important Bible question? For example, . . .” Then state a question that appears at the beginning of one of the lessons in the brochure, one that you think would appeal to the individual. For some ideas of questions that you might use, see paragraphs 15 and 16 in the March 1997 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> insert, entitled: “Muster Up Boldness to Make Return Visits.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Joyfully accepting the challenge of making return visits and conducting Bible studies is part of being God’s “fellow workers.” (1 Cor. 3:9) As we work hard to cultivate the interest we find and then rely on Jehovah to make things grow, we will experience the real satisfaction that no other work can produce.</span></p></li></ul>

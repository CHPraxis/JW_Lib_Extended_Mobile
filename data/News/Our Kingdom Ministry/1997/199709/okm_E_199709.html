<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">September 1997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 40, No. 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Set the More Important Things First</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> What are some important things that are vital to our spiritual well-being? These would surely include personal study, meeting attendance, persistent prayer, good association, and the Christian ministry. We cannot maintain good spiritual health without keeping important things foremost in our lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> However, all of us have a battle against fleshly desires and have a need for discipline. (Gal. 5:17) Never should we feel that there is more to be gained by pursuing selfish interests. (Jer. 17:9) Therefore, if we are to safeguard our heart and avoid being misled, regular self-examination is crucial.—Prov. 4:23; 2 Cor. 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Examine Your Own Heart: </span><span class="font7">You can do this by asking yourself some candid questions: Do I long to read God’s Word? (1 Pet. 2:2) Do I appreciate the importance of attending all the congregation meetings? (Heb. 10:24, 25) Do I persevere in prayer? (Rom. 12:12) Do I seek the company of spiritually minded people? (Rom. 1:11, 12) Do I feel a personal obligation to declare the good news? (1 Cor. 9:16) Positive answers will show that you are desirous of putting the more important things first.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Examine Your Daily Routine: </span><span class="font7">You need to follow up the examination of your heart’s desires by establishing priorities for the use of time. This includes scheduling time for regularly reading the Bible and every issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font7"> as well as for preparing for the meetings. Time must also be set aside for the family both to study and to pray together. Set a limit on how much time is spent in front of the TV or the computer. Be determined to attend all congregation meetings, and arrange everything else around them. Plan for the whole family to share in the field service each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Without a doubt, setting the more important things first in our life will prove to be a cause for joy.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Studies That Produce Disciples</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> “What prevents me from getting baptized?” asked the Ethiopian eunuch after Philip “declared to him the good news about Jesus.” (Acts 8:27-39) In the eunuch’s case, he already had a love for God’s inspired writings, and after receiving spiritual help from Philip, he was ready to become a disciple. But not all people are convinced that they need to examine the Scriptures for themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Thankfully, Jehovah’s organization has provided the new brochure, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Book for All People, </span><span class="font7">to encourage people to examine the Bible’s message for our day. The information in the brochure should be appealing to sincere people who may be educated but who know little about the Bible. This fine instrument is designed to move people to want to look into the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> When starting a Bible study, it would be helpful to review the excellent suggestions published in the June 1996 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> insert on how a productive study can be conducted in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book. During the course of the study, consider the progress being made by the student so that you can determine which areas need further attention. Encourage the student to prepare his lessons in advance, looking up the scriptures. Comments made in his own words may reflect his heartfelt appreciation for the truth. Rapid progress is usually made by those who do additional reading of the Society’s publications and regularly attend congregation meetings. Encourage him to speak informally to others about what he is learning. Kindly show him what he needs to do to make spiritual progress. We should not conduct studies indefinitely with indecisive ones. Students ought to take the initiative to learn, take a firm stand for the truth, and advance toward dedication and baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> In some households, more than one study is being conducted, as different members of the family have separate studies. However, having a united family study may be preferable in most cases, since it would help draw the family together spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Jesus’ command is that we go make disciples. (Matt. 28:19) To do so, we must conduct Bible studies that help the students to progress to the point that they may ask, “What prevents me from getting baptized?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">■ Literature offer for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">September: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> October: </span><span class="font7">Individual copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Starting in the latter part of the month, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> No. 35 will be distributed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">November: </span><span class="font7">Distribution of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> No. 35 will continue. Congregations that complete their territory by reaching householders in each home or dwelling with a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> No. 35 may offer the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">December: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> with the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make an announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated persons who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ It is important that groups of 30 or more persons planning to visit the Society’s facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting Brooklyn Bethel, Watchtower Farms at Wallkill, the Watchtower Educational Center at Patterson, or the Jersey City Assembly Hall. Please provide information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The Society will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. LODGING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CONGREGATION ELDERS AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONGREGATION SECRETARY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font7"> including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation. ■ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">each month</span><span class="font7"> before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Congregations may now begin submitting requests for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness —On Videocassette</span><span class="font7"> (Volumes 1 through 6) in American Sign Language. They will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists until the videocassettes are available. Efforts will be made to ship each videocassette in time for the material contained in it to be considered at the Congregation Book Study. These videocassettes should be requested only for those familiar with American Sign Language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ When making literature requests, congregations should keep in mind that the Society’s CD-ROM is not to be distributed indiscriminately. It is primarily for the use of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ The May 1997 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> “Question Box” recommended that we be cautious about working in the ministry with publishers of the opposite sex. There are good reasons for all to use good judgment in this matter. This does not mean that traveling overseers or even other brothers cannot work in the field ministry with sisters. Rather, the thought was expressed that it is not wise for a brother to be spending time </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">regularly </span><span class="font7">alone with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">same person</span><span class="font7"> of the opposite sex to whom he is not related.</span></p>

Those who follow his guidelines find that </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">problems are minimized</span><span class="font7"> and a successful family unit results. During September we have the privilege of sharing with others the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font7"> Take the initiative to approach people on the subject of family life. Be friendly, positive, and discerning. What might you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a question such as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Have you noticed that many families are finding it difficult to endure the pressures of life? {All</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ow for respons</span><span class="font7">e.] Reports m-dicate that many people experience difficulties in the home. </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">What do you believe </span><span class="font7">would </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">help families to find</span><span class="font7"> gr</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">eater s</span><span class="font7">tabili-. ty and happiness?

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> On </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the return visit, you might pursue the goal of starting a Bible study by saying:</span></p>

[Show the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font7"> brochure, turn to page 16, and read the six questions at the top.] Obviously, each one in the family must do his part to contribute toward family happiness.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Multitudes Are Being Added</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As was true in the first century, the growth that the Christian congregation is experiencing today is phenomenal. (Acts 2:41; 4:4) Last year, 366,579 new disciples were baptized, an average of over 1,000 each day! More than one million were baptized in the last three years. Indeed, Jehovah has kept on adding multitudes of believers.—Acts 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The many new ones who lack experience in Christian living need assistance and training from those who are strong in the faith. (Rom. 15:1) Among the early Christians were some who, even years after their baptism, had failed to “press on to maturity.” (Heb. 5:12; 6:1) That is why, in his letter to the Hebrews, Paul highlighted areas in which Christians need to grow spiritually. What are these, and how can needed help be offered?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Acquiring Good Study Habita: </span><span class="font12">In harmony with Paul’s instruction, being a good student involves actively learning, repeating, and using the “solid food” provided by Jehovah’s organization. (Heb. 5:13, 14; see the August 15, 1993, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> pages 12-17.) By engaging new believers In spiritual conversations and sharing with them precious gems of truth that you have uncovered through personal research, you may stimulate them to acquire good study habits. Perhaps occasionally you could invite a new one to join you in your personal or family study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Attending Meetings Regularly: </span><span class="font12">Your faithful example and loving words of encouragement will help new members of the congregation to avoid another area of concern mentioned by Paul—“the custom” some have of missing Christian meetings. (Heb. 10: 24, 25) Help them to appreciate that the meetings are their spiritual lifeline to the congregation. Take the Initiative to make them feel welcome as part of our brotherhood.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Approaching Jehovah With Confidence: </span><span class="font12">To overcome fleshly weaknesses and personality flaws, we must seek Jehovah in prayer, expressing to him our deepest thoughts and most intimate concerns. New ones must learn that by supplicating Jehovah for help, as Paul urged, they need not falter. (Heb. 4:15,16; 10:22) Relating your personal experiences in this regard will strengthen a new one’s confidence that Jehovah hears heartfelt prayers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Allocating Tima for the Ministry: </span><span class="font12">Paul also showed that when we “always offer to God a sacrifice of praise,&quot; it is spiritually strengthening. (Heb. 13:15) Can you invite a new publisher to join you in your weekly arrangements for field service? Perhaps the two of you could prepare your presentations or consider a feature of the ministry that the newer one has not yet tried.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The multitudes being added are a cause for great joy. Our expending ourselves In training and exhorting new members of the congregation will help them to develop the strong faith needed to ‘preserve alive their souls.’ —Heb. 3:12,13; 10:39.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Inexperienced Ones Understand</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> By means of the disciple-making work, we teach others what God requires of them. (Matt. 28:19, 20) A tremendous effort to do that is being put forth worldwide by more than five million Witnesses. Success is not measured by the hours spent, the literature placed, or the Bible studies started. We achieve our objective when people understand and act upon what they learn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Helping others spiritually involves “making the inexperienced ones understand.” (Ps. 119:130) Hearts are touched and people are motivated only when they “get the sense of it.” (Matt. 15:10) As our work expands and intensifies, we come to appreciate more and more the need to speak and teach with simplicity. That is why the Society has published the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font12"> It contains a well-rounded study course that covers the funaamental teachings of the Bible. The lessons are short, the wording is uncomplicated, and the instruction is easy to comprehend, giving the brochure wide appeal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’This brochure will be featured along with the magazines during the months of April and May. It is recommended tfhat when you plan your weekly service activity, you arrange to offer the magazines on Saturdays but feature the brochure in your ministry during the rest of the week. Take the brochure to people who have readily accepted literature in the past. Remember that it can be especially useful In teaching children, people who speak a foreign language, and those who have limited reading ability.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use a Simple Approach: </span><span class="font12">When presenting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure, refer to page 2, where it explains that “this brochure is designed as a Bible study course.” Point to paragraph 3 on page 3 to show why the person needs to study the Bible. Stir his interest with some of the lesson titles that reveal simple Bible truths. Demonstrate how this brochure makes learning a pleasure, and offer to give him personal help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Conduct a Progressive Study: </span><span class="font12">Our goal is to do more than just conduct studies—we want to make disciples who will become firm supporters of true worship. The brochure can be covered in a matter of weeks and should lead right into a study of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book. (See the footnote on page 31.) Right from the start, help the student identify Jehovah’s organization. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, pages 283-4.) Emphasize the value of congregation meetings, and explain that attending them provides a comprehensive understanding of how to practice true worship.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’A full share in this special work during April and May is sure to bring us the joy that comes from helping sincere ones to “acquire understanding” that leads to life—Prov. 4:5.</span></p>

Review key suggestions covered in August 15,1993, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> pages 12-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font12">“Help Inexperienced Ones Understand.&quot; Questions and answers. Review features of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure: simplified study method, timely questions, appealing illustrations, abundant Scripture references. Stress the goal of starting studies that eventually lead Into the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book. Have a capable publisher demonstrate how to start a study using the approach outlined in paragraph 4. Encourage all parents in the congregation to study the brochure with their young children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Accounts report. As time permits, briefly relate local field experiences about placing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure or starting Bible studies using it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Directing Students to the Organization Behind Our Name.” (Paragraphs 1-6) Questions and answers. Read paragraphs 5-6 and the cited scriptures. Relate local experiences about the reaction of Bible students to seeing the video </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —The Organization Behind the Name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">“Teach Others What God Requires.&quot; Audience discussion of paragraphs 1-4. Have presentations in paragraph 5 demonstrated, using four different settings—on the street, at a house, in a business place, and at a park. Remind all to pick up brochures and magazines for field service before leaving the Kingdom Hall tonight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Song 113</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Explain that it is not too late to submit an application for auxiliary pioneering in May. Review the Question Box, and let the congregation know if certain books are needed to fill out the library in the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Directing Students to the Organization Behind Our Name.” (Paragraphs 7-14) Questions and answers. Have a capable teacher demonstrate how to have a kindly heart-to-heart discussion with a student about the need to attend meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Making Full Use of Our Literature. Talk by an elder. (See September 1995 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font12">pages 3-5.) Reports show that congregations often order many more magazines than they actually distribute each month. Up to 50 percent are never reported as placements. (Show what the statistics indicate locally.) What happens to these magazines? Many end up on a shelf or are thrown away. How can this be avoided? Each publisher should carefully estimate his needs and order only what he can place. Make it a practice to offer magazines to all we contact. Do not let older issues go to waste. Share in magazine service regularly. Bear in mind that we need to mention the donation arrangement and to turn in all donations promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 128 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting April 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 121</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Remind all to turn in their field service reports for April. Announce the names of those who will auxiliary pioneer in May. Outline the additional arrangements that are being made locally for meetings for service. During May a special effort should be made to follow up brochure placements with the goal of starting studies. Briefly suggest ways we can tactfully request the name and address of people we witness to informally. You could give your name and address first and ask if there is a phone number where they can be reached. Invite audience to offer other suggestions that have worked for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Why Do They Do It?” An elder discusses article with two or three regular pioneers. (If not available, use ones who enroll often as auxiliary pioneers.) Include highlights from article “Pioneers Bestow and Receive Blessings,” in the January 15, 1994, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Have each one explain why he or she has taken up the pioneer service. Ask them to relate experiences showing how they have been blessed for doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Local needs. Elders may use this time to present information on specific local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 129 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It was foretold about the Christ that ‘sheer zeal for God’s house would eat him up.' (Ps. 69:9) Jesus’ zeal for the true worship of Jehovah Impelled him to put the ministry first. (Luke 4: 43; John 18:37) This same zeal to bear witness to the truth is reflected today in the ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Last service year, an average of 645,509 worldwide shared in some form of pioneer service each month. In view of our dedication to God, each of us should prayerfully consider whether we can arrange our circumstances in order to serve as an auxiliary or a regular pioneer. —Ps. 110:3; Eccl. 12:1; Rom. 12:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Living in a system of things that is selfishly materialistic, many in the world find it hard to understand why anyone would work so hard in the ministry for something that brings no monetary benefits and no glory. Why do pioneers do it? They know that they are engaged in a lifesaving work. Motivated by deep love for Jehovah and for their fellowman, they feel a strong, personal obligation to help save lives. (Rom. 1:14-16; 1 Tim. 2:4; 4:16) A pioneer couple summed it up well by saying: “Why are we pioneering? Could we ever justify it before Jehovah if we did not?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Another sister wrote this about her decision to start pioneering: “My husband and I made plans to live on a single income, which meant giving up all nonessentials. Yet, Jehovah richly blessed us, never abandoning us to poverty or need. ... I have found a real reason for living —that of helping needy ones to come to know that Jehovah, the true God, is not far from those who seek him.&quot; Seeing the urgency of the times, pioneers are content with the necessities of life while they earnestly seek to acquire spiritual treasures that will last forever.—1 Tim. 6:8,18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If your personal circumstances permit, why not join the hundreds of thousands of your brothers and sisters worldwide who are pioneering? That way you can experience their same joy.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Thus begins the narration of the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">video</span><span class="font13"> * Je-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">jftovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind'the Name.</span><span class="font13"> It proceeds to answer the questions: Who really are Jehovah’s Witnesses? How is their activity organized? Directed? Financed? It impresses upon viewers the fact that “Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide have been trained as an organization to assist their neighbors to build faith in the Bible,” and it encourages </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">them to see for themselves </span><span class="font13">the organization behind our name. After seeing this video, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">a woman</span><span class="font13"> who&lt; was studying burst into tears of joy and appreciation and said: “How can anyone not see that this </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font13"> the organization of the true God, Jehovah?”—Compare 1 Corinthians 14:24, 25. X</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Another w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">oman</span><span class="font13"> had studied the Bible off and on for a long time, but she could not accept the fact that the T</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">rinity is a false doctrin</span><span class="font13">e. Then she and her husband were shown our video. ^They were very impressed with the presentation and watched it twice the same night. At their next study, the wife expressed her desire to become a Witness. She said she had been focusing on her belief in the Trinity and failed to look at our organization and the people in it. From the video she realized that she had found God’s true organization. She wanted to start preaching from house to house right away. After it was explained to her what the necessary steps are for becoming an unbaptized publisher, s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">he said</span><span class="font13">: “Let’s get busy with it.” She resigned from her church, started in the field service activity, and became proficient at refuting the Trinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-p</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It has </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">been well estab</span><span class="font13">lished' that Bible students make better spiritual progress and grow to maturity more rapidly when they recognize Jehovah’s organization and associate with it. Significantly, a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">fter the </span><span class="font13">3.000 were baptized at Pentecost, “they </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">continued</span><span class="font13"> de</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">voting</span><span class="font13"> themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to association together.” (Acts 2:42, ftn.) It is essential that we help students to do the same today. How can we? ,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Shoulder the Responsibility: </span><span class="font13">Every disci-/C pie maker must realize that it is his r</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">espon</span><span class="font13">sibility f to direct the Bible student to God’s organization. (1 </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tim. 4:16</span><span class="font13">r~Each study session should be viewed as a stepping-stone toward the happy day when the new one will symbolize his dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. One of the questions that he will be asked during the baptism ceremony is: “Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in association with God’s spirit-directed organization?” Hence, it is important that he realize he cannot serve God without actively associating with the true Christian congregation.—Matt. 24:45-47; John 6:68; 2 Cor. 5:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Continue to educate the student about the lo- )/-cal congregation and the international organiza- J tion behind Jehovah’s Witnesses. Do this at each </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font13">Bible study session, beginning with the first one. From the very start, invite the student to the 1/ meetings, and keep on inviting him—</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Rev. 22:17</span><span class="font13">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Use the Tools That Are Provided: </span><span class="font13">Our best publications for use in conducting home Bible <sup>z </sup>studies are the brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font13"> and the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font13"> Both highlight the need for association with the congregation. The end of lesson 5 in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure states: “You need to keep learning about Jehovah and obeying his requirements. Attending meetings at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses will help you to do so.” The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book repeatedly encourages the student to associate at meetings. Chapter 5, paragraph 22, extends this invitation: “Jehovah’s Witnesses . . . warmly urge you to share with them In worshiping God ‘with spirit and truth.’ (John 4:24)” Chapter 12, paragraph 16, states: “As you continue this study and make it your custom to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, your faith will be fortified even more.” Chapter 16, paragraph 20, says: “Make it your custom to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” It adds: “This will help you to understand and then apply the knowledge of God in your life and will bring you happiness. Being a part of the worldwide Christian brotherhood will help you to stay close to Jehovah.” Chapter 17 thoroughly discusses how one finds true security among God’s people. As we study with others, it is our responsibility to emphasize these portions of the material.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide</span><span class="font13"> is a fine tool that has been produced to acquaint individuals with the only visible organization Jehovah is using today to accomplish his will. The detailed information it contains about our ministry, meetings, and organization will encourage the reader to associate with us in worshiping God. Once a Bible study is established, it is recommended that we give the student a copy of this brochure to read on his own. There is no need to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">study it with him as was done in the past.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Some of the videos that the Society has produced are excellent tools for directing students to the organization behind our name. It would be good if they could watch (1) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The New World Society in Action,</span><span class="font13"> the review of the 1954 film that captured the smooth, efficient, and loving spirit with which Jehovah’s organization functions; (2) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">United by Divine Teaching,</span><span class="font13"> which examines the peaceful unity that has been displayed at our international conventions in Eastern Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia; (3) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">To the Ends of the Earth,</span><span class="font13"> which marked the 50th anniversary of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and shows the effect the missionaries have had on the worldwide preaching work; (4) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault,</span><span class="font13"> which tells the thrilling story of the Witnesses’ courage and triumph in the face of Hitler’s brutal persecution of them; and, of course, (5) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —The Organization Behind the Name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Set Progressive Goals Regarding Meetings: </span><span class="font13">It has to be explained to students that we need both the private tutoring that is provided in the home Bible study setting and the classroom discussions that are provided at congregation meetings. (John 6:45) A new one needs to progress equally in his understanding of both the Scriptures and the organization. To that end, there is no substitute for attending the meetings. (Heb. 10:23-25) Start inviting the person to the congregation meetings right away. Some newly interested ones start attending meetings even before having a regular home Bible study. Of course, we want to set the proper example ourselves by being in regular attendance.—Luke 6:40; Phil. 3:17.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not delay inviting students to attend meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Share enough information about the meetings and how they are conducted so that the student will feel at ease when attending his first meeting. Since some people are very uneasy when going to new places for the first time, it may be advantageous to accompany the student to the Kingdom Hall when he attends his first meeting. He will feel more at ease if you are with him as he meets members of the congregation. By all means, be a good host to your visitor, making him feel welcome and comfortable.—Matt. 7:12; Phil.</span></p></li></ul>

However, our primary focus should be on the publications provided by “the faithful and discreet slave.” —Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In some cases it is reported that books of a questionable nature have been put in the Theocratic Ministry School library. It would not be appropriate to include fictional material, Bible commentaries that highlight higher criticism, or books on philosophy or spiritism. The Theocratic Ministry School library should include only material that will enable those using it to make continued spiritual advancement.—! Tim. 4:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The school overseer is responsible for the library, although another brother can be assigned to help him in caring for it. He should see that the library is kept current, with new publications being added as soon as they become available. Each book should be clearly marked on the inside cover with the name of the congregation to which it belongs. Annually, the books should be checked to see if any need repair or replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Everyone can cooperate in caring for the library. Care should be exercised in handling and using the books. Children should not be allowed to play with them, nor should anyone mark them. A neat sign may be displayed as a reminder that the books are not to be taken from the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With new congregations constantly being formed, it is likely that many libraries are limited in size. Some publishers who own our older publications might consider donating them to the congregation. The elders may want to order the Society’s reprints of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> bound volumes. In these ways, the Theocratic Ministry School library will prove very useful in helping all to uncover the hidden treasures of God’s Word, which give knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.—Prov. 2:4-6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many people can still be found who have been spiritually deprived of “hearing the words of Jehovah.” (Amos 8:11) While some believe that God exists, they are unaware of his purpose and requirements. Thus, there is a need for us to teach them lifesaving Kingdom truth. By being properly equipped and prepared to witness at every opportunity, we can reach those who want to learn what Jehovah requires.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During April and May, we will have very timely issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> to distribute. Additionally, for the first time, we will feature the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font12"> Its eye-catching illustrations and thought-provoking questions give this brochure wide appeal. The following suggestions are offered to help us use our excellent publications to good advantage.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Searching Out People: </span><span class="font12">In areas where many people are not at home when we call from house to house, it is proving beneficial to search out and talk to people wherever they are found. The September 1996 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> insert encouraged us to preach the good news everywhere—on the street, on public transportation, and in parks, parking lots, and business places. It also made us conscious of the need to create opportunities to preach informally. As an example of this, a pioneer sister went to the zoo and took with her a supply of the August 8, 1996, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> with the series “Endangered Species—Why Be Concerned?” Within an hour, she placed 40 copies with some very appreciative animal lovers! What success have you enjoyed thus far preaching the good news everywhere? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> as well as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font12">brochure are especially suited for all kinds of witnessing because they feature information that touches people’s lives and stimulates thinking ability.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Starting Conversations: </span><span class="font12">The back page of the October 1996 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> gives details on how to prepare your own presentation for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">magazines. The same suggestions will work well when preparing your presentation for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> bro-chureCWhat we say can be as brief as a few sentences or long enough to include a Scriptural thought. It is important to select the opening words carefully, since they may determine whether the person you approach will continue to listen.'.Some have been successful with thisr opening comment: “I read an article that was encouraging to me, and I want to share it with you.” Or an interesting question can be raised to draw the other party into a conversation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>b</sup>If appropriate in your area, you might try asking questions like the following in your presentations this month:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Today we see so much graffiti, litter, and pollution. What will it take to clean up the earth and make it a better place in which to live?” Allow for a response, and then explain that you have information that assures us of how and when the earth will become a global garden. Share a specific comment, a brief scripture, and a colorful illustration from a current magazine, and then offer it to the individual for him to read. Mention that many who enjoy reading our publications offer a donation, which we gladly put toward our worldwide work. Before you end the conversation, try to arrange to continue it at another time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Do you think that God meant for us to live surrounded by troubles sualyas those we are faced with to-dayT </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">After the person answers</span><span class="font12">, you coulu say: “Likely you are familiar with the prayer Jesus taught his followers to pray, asking for God’s Kingdom to come.

Explain that the rest of the questions are answered Just as concisely. Offer the brochure, mention the arrangement for donations, and offer to meet again to share more information about the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Many thinking people are beginning to view the religions of the world as the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause of man’s prob</span><span class="font12">lems rather than being the solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hat d</span><span class="font12">o you.think about that?” AL-y </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ter~hstening to the person’s view</span><span class="font12">- ( point, show </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">some</span><span class="font12">thing from one of the current magazines that may capture his interest about false religion’s failure or its approaching downfall. Ask if he would like to read it. Exchange names, and offer to make contact again so that you can explain how it is that true religion has not failed mankind. Wherever appropriate, explain how the interested person may make a small donation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “With so many problems In family life today, have you ever wondered what is the s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecret for obtaining fami</span><span class="font12">l</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">y happiness?</span><span class="font12">&quot; </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Wait for a response,</span><span class="font12">A and explain that in the Bible, God reveals the r</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">eal secret of family happi</span><span class="font12">ness.

Offer to return another time to share more of the practical guidance that the Bible contains for.happy family life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The insert in the Maren 19sJ7 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> encouraged us to-* muster up boldness to make return visits.

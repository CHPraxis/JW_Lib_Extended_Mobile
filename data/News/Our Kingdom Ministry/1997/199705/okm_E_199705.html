<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">May 1997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 40, No. 5</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Jesus Continually</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> On one occasion Jesus said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.” (Matt. 16:24) We certainly want to respond positively to Jesus’ words. Let us examine what is involved with each phrase of his invitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> “Let Him Disown Himself”: </span><span class="font10">When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah, we disown ourselves. The basic meaning of the Greek word translated “disown&quot; is “to say no.” That means we voluntarily surrender our own ambitions, desires, comforts, and selfish pleasures—being determined to please Jehovah throughout all eternity.—Rom. 14:8; 15:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">’ “Pick Up His Torture Stake&quot;: </span><span class="font10">The Christian’s life is a life of carrying the torture stake of sacrificial service to Jehovah. One way the spirit of self-sacrifice may be reflected is by exerting oneself in the ministry. So far this year, many publishers have been enjoying the auxiliary pioneer work. Perhaps you are among them and can affirm that the blessings you derive more than compensate for the sacrifices you make. Those who are unable to serve as auxiliary pioneers have frequently arranged to spend more time in the preaching work as congregation publishers. To that end, some congregations are scheduling their meetings for field service a few minutes earlier than they once did. With the arrival of spring, many publishers appreciate having this longer period for field service. Some have had excellent results too when they decided to call on ‘just one more house’ or to work ‘only a few minutes longer.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘Another way the spirit of selfsacrifice is displayed is by the setting of personal goals. With careful planning and by adjusting their schedule, some have become regular pioneers. Others have been able to arrange their affairs so as to make themselves available for Bethel or missionary service. Some have moved to an area where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> “Continually Follow Me”: </span><span class="font10">Although Jesus’ disciples experienced many trials, they were encouraged by his zeal and endurance in the ministry. (John 4:34) They felt renewed in their spirit by his presence and his message. That is why those who followed him radiated genuine joy. (Matt. 11:29) Let us likewise encourage one another to endure in the all-important work of Kingdom preaching and disciple making.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> May we all react positively to Jesus’ invitation to follow him continually by cultivating the spirit of selfsacrifice. As we do, we will have great joy now and can look forward to even greater blessings in the future.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Home Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is it that a nurse in Tanzania, a youngster in Argentina, and a mother in Latvia have in common? The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1997 Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> (pp. 8, 46, and 56) reports that all three made rapid progress in their home Bible studies, thanks to their willingness to have more than one session each week in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. It has been recommended that whenever possible, publishers should endeavor to discuss one chapter of the book during each study session. However, some find that it is a challenge to do so. Although much will depend on the circumstances and the aptitude of each student, experienced teachers have found success by implementing the following suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As was discussed in the June 1996 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> Insert, it is necessary to train your students to prepare for the study. At the very start, it would be good to explain and demonstrate how this is done. Show them your personal study copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. Prepare the first lesson together. Help the students to find the key words or phrases that directly answer the printed question and then underline or highlight them. Some publishers have even given their students a highlighting marker. Encourage them to look up all the scriptures as they prepare for the study. In the process, you will also be training them to prepare for attending the Congregation Book Study and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study.—Luke 6:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A good teacher will draw out the student and not talk too much himself. He avoids becoming sidetracked on minor points. Rarely would he bring in outside material. Instead, he highlights the main points of the lesson. Some have provided students with additional literature to help them find answers to questions. Further, interested ones will receive additional detailed information through attending congregation meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">&lt; It may not be necessary to look up all the cited scriptures in the lesson. Some main points might be explained from the quoted texts in the paragraph. During the review, highlight the key scriptures that were discussed and encourage the student to remember these.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How Long Should Each Session Last?: </span><span class="font10">The study need not be limited to one hour. Some householders have time available and may desire to study longer. Or the student may wish to study more than once a week. This would be beneficial for those who can do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> As Isaiah 60:8 portrays, today hundreds of thousands of new prais-ers of Jehovah “come flying just like a cloud, and like doves to their birdhouse holes” into the congregations of his people. Let all of us do our part in working closely with Jehovah as he speeds up the ingathering of sheeplike ones.—Isa. 60:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Song 174 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ What cautions are needed when we are in association with someone of the opposite sex in connection with our ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have reason to expect that our brothers and sisters intend to adhere to the highest moral standard in their personal conduct. Nevertheless, we live in an unclean and permissive world that has few moral limitations. While we may have the best of intentions, we must be on guard constantly to avoid causing reproach or getting involved in something improper. This includes being careful while engaged in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In field service we often encounter people of the opposite sex who manifest what appears to be a sincere interest in the truth. If we are alone when we make the call and there is no one else at home, usually it would be best to give a witness at the door rather than go inside. If there is interest, arrangements can be made to return when we will be accompanied by another publisher or when others in the household will be present also. If this is not possible, it would be wise to turn the call over to a publisher of the same sex as the householder. This also applies to conducting Bible studies with someone of the opposite sex.—Matt. 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We need to be careful when choosing someone to work with in the ministry. Although publishers of the opposite sex may work together at times, this is best done when with a group. Ordinarily, even while in the ministry, it is not wise for us to be spending time alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not our marriage mate. Hence, the brother in charge of the service group should use good judgment when assigning publishers, including teenagers, to work together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By always using good judgment, we will avoid “giving any cause for stumbling” to either ourselves or others.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul reminded Timothy that “all Scripture is inspired of God.” (2 Tim. 3:16) Since God’s Word is inspired, we have every reason to exercise faith in it. The theme of this year’s district convention is “Faith in God’s Word.” The program will strengthen our faith in the Bible, whether we have known the truth for many years or have just recently come into contact with Jehovah’s organization. All of us should arrange to be in attendance for the entire program. How upbuilding it will be if newly interested persons, particularly those with whom we study the Bible, attend with us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Three-Day Convention: </span><span class="font10">This year a three-day district convention program has been arranged for our benefit. The February 15, 1997, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> lists 193 conventions to be held in the contiguous United States. By now you have been informed of the convention to which your congregation is assigned, and you should have made definite plans to attend all three days of the program. Have you approached your employer to get the needed time off? If you have school-age children and your convention falls during the school term, have you kindly informed their teachers that your children will be absent on Friday for this important part of their religious training? —Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In addition to English, there will be conventions in American Sign Language, Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> The program will begin each day at 9:30 a.m. Doors will open at 8:00 a.m. The only ones permitted to enter before that time will be those with work assignments, but they will not be allowed to save seats until the building opens for everyone. —Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Do Well by Paying Attention: </span><span class="font10">The apostle Peter reminded first-century Christians that they would do well to pay attention to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place. (2 Pet. 1:19) The same is true of us. Living in this old world that is under Satan’s control is like being in a dark place. We are grateful to have been called out of spiritual darkness. (Col. 1:13; 1 Pet. 2:9; 1 John 5:19) To remain in the light, we need to keep our faith strong by paying attention to the inspired Word of Jehovah. Our district convention this summer will encourage us to do just that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Effort may be required on our part if we are to concentrate on the program, but we certainly will be blessed for doing so. We should endeavor to come to the convention site well rested so that we will be alert during the sessions. Allow ample time to get to the convention site each day in order to be in your seat before the program begins. Then join in the opening song and prayer at the start of each day’s program. Adults should set the example, and parents should train their children. —Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If we look over the titles of the parts before the day’s program begins, we can try to anticipate what points might be brought out during that session. This will enhance our interest in the material when it is presented. We may look for points that will help us express to others why we believe in God and in his sure promise to reward those earnestly seeking him. (Heb. 11:1, 6) It has been recommended that we take brief notes to help us remember the main points of the program. If we take too many notes, we may miss some key points because we are too busy writing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Last year many adults and youths were again observed walking aimlessly through the corridors, milling around outside, and visiting with others while the program was in progress, rather than listening to what “the faithful and discreet slave” had provided for our benefit. Jesus promised to give us spiritual food at the proper time. (Matt. 24:45-47) Therefore, we ought to be present to benefit from that food and not show a lack of appreciation. (2 Cor. 6:1) It also seems that when some children get restless, they often ask to use the rest room as an excuse to get up and walk around. Proper training at home will usually make frequent trips to the rest room unnecessary. At times, older youths sit together in remote places, talking, whispering, and passing notes to each other. Our young people, who face many pressures today, need to concentrate on the material being presented, not to be doing other things during the program. Youthful desires that do not harmonize with Bible principles should be avoided. (Compare 2 Timothy 2:22.) The attentiveness of all, adults and youths, will honor Jehovah and make him rejoice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> If it becomes necessary for one of the attendants to give anyone counsel in these matters, it should be accepted as a loving provision from Jehovah. (Gal. 6:1) All need to remember that the reason we put forth effort to attend the convention is so that we may ‘listen and learn.’ (Deut. 31: 12) Also, “a wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) In the time remaining before you attend the convention, discuss as a family the need to sit together in the audience, remain seated during the program, and be keenly attentive, in order to gain the full benefit of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Adornment That Pleases Jehovah: </span><span class="font10">Jehovah’S people are on display for all the world to see. (1 Cor. 4:9) We are generally noted for our fine standard of dress and grooming. Applying the Scriptural principles found at 1 Timothy 2:9, 10 and at 1 Peter 3:3,4 has resulted in great changes in the appearance of many compared with how they looked when they began associating with the Christian congregation. This is in sharp contrast to the steadily deteriorating standards of dress and grooming that we see in the world. We want to be on guard that we do not become like the world in our appearance—wearing outlandish clothing, promoting worldly fads in hairstyles, or being immodestly dressed. Our exemplary dress and grooming should help new ones who attend the convention to see how Christians ought to adorn themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> While the general impression left as a result of last year’s conventions was very favorable, worldly dress and grooming continue to be a problem with some of the brothers and sisters, especially during leisure time. While making our plans to attend the convention, we should analyze ourselves as to our dress and grooming. Parents, wisely monitor what your young children and teenagers are going to wear. Make sure we are not letting worldly styles and fads have a bad effect on our Christian appearance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Maintain Fine Conduct: </span><span class="font10">Fine conduct is a mark of true Christians. (1 Pet. 2:12) Our behavior wherever we may be—at the convention, at restaurants, and in hotels, as well as when traveling—can give a fine witness and help others to see what faith in God and in his Word can do for people. This may move some to come to know Jehovah. (Compare 1 Peter 3:1, 2.) We have the privilege of glorifying God by our conduct. The management of one hotel in Alabama said that our delegates are “the nicest and best behaved group they host.” They added: “It will be a privilege to have you back in the future.” A convention and visitors bureau in the northwestern United States wrote: “Each year, the Watchtower Society conference is eagerly awaited by our entire community. Your members are a true delight; conducting themselves with the utmost courtesy and respect. Our businesses recognize this and treasure the return of their ‘family’ of guests each year.” Reports like these are a pleasure to read, are they not? There is a need to remain vigilant, however, so that we may preserve the good reputation of Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> Many reminders have been given about controlling our children, not letting them run around hotels unattended, disturbing other guests. Each year, the Society receives reports that some of our children are unsupervised in and around the swimming pool or are seen running in hallways and public areas of hotels. One manager who stayed overnight at his hotel was awakened twice after 11:00 p.m. by groups of our children knocking on each room door looking for other Witnesses. Although the conventions provide us the opportunity to visit and associate with our brotherhood, parents must still keep in mind their obligation to provide supervision for their children at all times. This is a responsibility that Jehovah places on every parent. (Prov. 1:8; Eph. 6:4) The unsupervised actions of children can undermine the good reputation that other Witnesses of Jehovah have worked hard to build.—Prov. 29:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> If a hotel provides a complimentary breakfast during your stay, you should not see this as an opportunity to stock up for the noon meal. Hotels have reported that some of our brothers and sisters have come down with plastic bags and filled them with fruit, Danish pastries, and bagels to be consumed later, leaving little for the other guests. Such hotel amenities are provided as a courtesy for guests while at the hotel and must not be abused. To take more than what you will eat during your breakfast meal would really demonstrate a greedy spirit, and it is also dishonest. If an improper attitude on the part of fellow Witnesses is observed, it would be a kindness to remind them of how they should be acting. Also remember, no cooking is to be done in hotel rooms unless they are equipped with a kitchen for that purpose. If you bring an ice chest to your room, please be sure it does not leak or sweat and damage the carpet, furniture, or walls of the room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> Keep in mind that tipping is appropriate when you receive a personal service, especially since many who serve the public, such as waiters, waitresses, maids, and bellmen, are dependent to a large extent on tips to make a living. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we want to show good manners in this regard too.—See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of June 22, 1986, pages 24-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">L </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">^Covering Con</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">vention Expenses</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font10">.All of US will have expenses in connection with attending the conventions. There is another expense that we do well to consider. Facilities that are used for conventions are expensive. There are also </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">other </span><span class="font10">expenses that must be cared for. Our generous voluntary contributions at the conventions are greatly appreciated.—</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Acts 20:35; 2 Cor.</span><span class="font10"> 9:7 1113</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Seating: </span><span class="font10">The directions that have been given for a number of years will continue to apply, namely, S</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">EATS MAY BE SAVED</span><span class="font10"> ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR. It has been good to see that more are complying with these directions in recent years, and this has heightened the loving atmosphere displayed at the conventions. At most sites some seats are more easily accessible than others. Please show consideration, and leave the more convenient seats for those whose circumstances require them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Cameras, Camcorders, and Audiocassette Recorders: </span><span class="font10">Cameras and recording equipment may be used at conventions. However, our use of them must not be distracting to others in attendance. We should n</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot walk around during the ses</span><span class="font10">s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ions taking picture</span><span class="font10">s, as that would disturb others who are trying to concentrate on the program. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">No recording devic</span><span class="font10">es of any sort are t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o be con-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font10"> rie</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">cted to theelectrical or sound systems,</span><span class="font10"> nor should this equipment block aisles, walkways, or the view of others.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> First Aid: </span><span class="font10">The First Aid Department is for emergencies only. It is not able to care for the chronically ill. That is why you should consider the health needs of yourself and your fam-?~ily in advance. Please </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">bripg</span><span class="font10"> your own aspirin, digestive aids, bandages' safety pins, and similar items, as such things will not be available at the convention. Any known to be at risk of seizures, insulin shock, heart problems, and so forth, should </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">anticipate their need</span><span class="font10">s to the extent possible. They should h</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ave the necessary medica</span><span class="font10">tion, and a </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">membe</span><span class="font10">r of the family </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">or the congr</span><span class="font10">egation wh</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o understan</span><span class="font10">ds thelr^I</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tuatio</span><span class="font10">h should be present with them at all times~to provide any needed assistance. Problems have arisen at conventions when individuals with chronic health problems w</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ere left alone and heeame ill</span><span class="font10"> The convention administration has had to contact emergency medical services to take them to a hospital. If some with special health needs do </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">not have </span><span class="font10">family members who can assist them, their con- * gregation el</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ders will need to be apprised</span><span class="font10"> of the situation and make necessary arrangements to help. No provision will be made at the conventions for special rooms to accommodate those who have allergies.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> Food at the Convention: </span><span class="font10">Having no food service at conventions has resulted in many more being free during all the sessions to concentrate^ on the spiritual food. A number of expressions o^ appreciation for this simplification have been re-. ceived since the arrangement was instituted. All should plan to bring their own practical, nourish-^&quot; ing food items for the noon break, such as thosq^ suggested in the May 1995 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">insert, paragraph 26. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">No glass containers</span><span class="font10"> and no ’ alcoholic beverages are to be brought into the convention iacffity. Food coolers must be small enough to fit </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font10"> your seat. Some in the audience have been observed e</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ating and drinkin</span><span class="font10">g d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">uring the program</span><span class="font10">. Doing this is disrespectful. Where there is a food court within the convention facility or there are v</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">endors on the outsid</span><span class="font10">e, some brothers have been ob</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">served</span><span class="font10"> p</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">atronizing</span><span class="font10"> these d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">uring the program</span><span class="font10"> Such a practice is inappropriate^</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>21</sup> We truly appreciate our spiritual feast and the relaxed, peaceful atmosphere of fellowship during our short noon breaks. In keeping with the ‘ purpose of this arrangement, instead nf leaving ‘ the facility at </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">the noon break to purchase f</span><span class="font10">ood, * please bring something with you. Thus, you will have more time to enjoy the fellowship of your brothers and sisters.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>22</sup> How glad we are that the “Faith in God’s Word” District Conventions will be s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tarting soon</span><span class="font10">! All of us want to be sure that our preparations have been made to attend the whole program, so that we can enjoy to the full the fine spiritual banquet Jehovah has prepared for us through his organization. In that way we will b</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecome</span><span class="font10"> “compl</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">etely equipp</span><span class="font10">ed for every good work” in the days <sub>? </sub>ahead.—2 Tim. 3:17. <sub>r</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">. tfo/k</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism: </span><span class="font10">Baptismal candidates should be seated in the designated section before the program begins on S</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">aturday morning,</span><span class="font10"> A </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font10"> bat</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">hing suit </span><span class="font10">and a t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">owel</span><span class="font10"> should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. In the past some have worn attire that was not appropriate and that detracted from the occasion. Elders reviewing with baptismal candidates the questions in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book should make sure that each one understands these points. Afte</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">r the baptism talk</span><span class="font10"> and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will call for a song. After the last stanza, the att</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">endants will direct</span><span class="font10"> the candidates to the immersion site. Baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah. Thus, it is inappropriate for candidates to embrace each other or to hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Badge Cards: </span><span class="font10">Please wear the 199</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">7 badge card</span><span class="font10"> at all times while in the convention city and while tra</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">veling to and from it</span><span class="font10">. This often creates opportunities for us to gi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve a fine witness</span><span class="font10">. Badge cards and holders should be obtained thr</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ough your con</span><span class="font10">gregation, as they will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font10"> be available at the convention. Do not wait until a few days before the convention to ask for cards for you and your family. Remember to carry your current Advance Medi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">cal Dire</span><span class="font10">ctiv</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e/Release card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming: </span><span class="font10">We are asking for the cooperation of everyone in using. ONLY the listing of accommodations provided by the convention. If we bypass the Society’s arrangement and secure accommodations at a hotel not on the approved list or pay more than the agreed-upon rate at one of the listed hotels, we undermine much of the hard work of our brothers Who negotiate with the hotels for better rates. Have in mind that the convention room rates also apply on Thursday and Sunday nights. IF YOU EXPERIENCE A P</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ROBLE</span><span class="font10">M WITH A HOTEL, please do not hesitate to notify the Rooming Dep</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">artment </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">while you are stilT at the convention</span><span class="font10"> so that they can assist you in resolving the matter right away. Please realize that it may not be possible for ev</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eryone to get a nonsmoking room</span><span class="font10"> at a hotel, even if the request was made when the reservation was booked. The same </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">applies</span><span class="font10"> to your preference for k</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing, queen, of~dbuble beds.</span><span class="font10"> Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special N</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eeds Room Reques</span><span class="font10">t forms are pro</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mptly forward</span><span class="font10">’-</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed to</span><span class="font10"> the appropriate convention address.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font10">In most locations, baby strollers cannot be used in places of public assembly. F</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ire regulations prohibit</span><span class="font10"> placing them in corridors 'and aisles or between' rows of seats. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, strollers are pot</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">entially dangerou</span><span class="font10">s both to the baby and to any who could stumble over them. So p</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">lease do not bring strollers to the convention </span><span class="font10">site. Infant or child car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Please d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o not bring lawn chairs. T</span><span class="font10">hey are dangerous and are not allowed at large public facilities. Your cooperation is important and appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font10">Can you set aside some time at the convention to assist in one of the departments? Serving our brothers, if onlyfor a few hours, will be very helpful and brings much personal satisfaction. If you can assist, please r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eport to th</span><span class="font10">e Vol</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">unteer Service Department at the conventio</span><span class="font10">n.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Words of Caution: </span><span class="font10">Keep alert to potential problems so as to avoid unnecessary difficulty. Often t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">hieves</span><span class="font10"> and other unscrupulous individuals prey on people who are away from their home environment. Be sure your veh</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">icle is locked </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">at all tim</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">es, </span><span class="font10">and n</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ever leave anything visible</span><span class="font10"> to tempt someone to break in. Thieves and pickpockets focus their attention on large gatherings. It would not </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">be wise</span><span class="font10"> to lea</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve any valuables at your seat</span><span class="font10">. You cannot be sure that everyone around you is a Christian. Why offer any temptation? Reports have been received of attempts made by some&quot;outsiders t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o lure children </span><span class="font10">away. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMEg, ' -<sup>cr</sup> &quot;— ~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

Parents may wish to prevent their children from activating </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">“pay TV”</span><span class="font10"> in their hotel room by requesting the hotel to lo</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ck out this feature</span><span class="font10"> during their stay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Do We Keep Going Back?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever asked yourself that question, perhaps as you were preparing for a day in service? In some areas where our territory is worked repeatedly, householders may recognize who we are and quickly turn us away. Only a few may respond in a favorable way. Yet, there are many powerful reasons why we keep going back.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First of all, we are commanded to continue preaching the Kingdom message until the end comes. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) The prophet Isaiah wondered how long he would have to continue his preaching work. The answer he received is recorded at Isaiah 6:11. There is no question about it—he was told to keep going back to the people with God’s message. Likewise today, though they may turn us away, Jehovah expects us to continue calling on the people living in our territory. (Ezek. 3:10,11) This is a sacred responsibility that has been entrusted to us.—1 Cor. 9:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Another reason for us to keep going back is that this gives us an opportunity to show the depth of our devotion to Jehovah. (1 John 5:3) Besides, when we contemplate what the near future holds for mankind, how can we hold ourselves back from lovingly trying to warn our neighbors? (2 Tim. 4:2; Jas. 2:8) Our being faithful in carrying out our assignment provides repeated opportunities for them to respond to God’s message of salvation, so that they will not be able to say they were not warned.—Ezek. 5:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Additionally, we never know when some people will have a change of heart. It can be prompted by a change in their personal circumstances, a tragedy in their family, or world conditions that cause them to think seriously about their future. Then again, something we say at their door may trigger a favorable response. (Eccl. 9:11; 1 Cor. 7: 31) Also, people move. We may find new residents in our territory who will respond to the good news—perhaps young adults who are now living on their own and are thinking seriously about their purpose in life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Will we keep going back? Yes! The Scriptures give us ample motivation to return to the people again and again. In the end, when the preaching work is finished, Jehovah will bless us for our continued effort in the ministry, and he will bless those who have responded appreciatively to the Kingdom good news. —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Show Genuine Concern for All the Interest Found</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The worldwide Kingdom proclamation will soon come to a close, after which all those “who do not know God” will suffer destruction. (2 Thess. 1:7-9) Thus, genuine concern for the lives of others is moving Jehovah’s people to reach as many as possible with the Kingdom message.—Zeph. 2:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Every month, millions of hours are spent in searching out those who want to hear “good news of something better.” (Isa. 52:7) In response to the current literature offer, many have accepted copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> or the brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font10"> Genuine concern for these people should prompt us to follow through on all the interest found.—Prov. 3:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Keep Accurate Records: </span><span class="font10">More will be accomplished if you keep a complete and accurate record of the interest and placements. Information such as the householder’s name and address, day and time you called, literature placed, and the subject discussed will help you to be more effective when returning. Also, if you write down some comments made by the householder in your initial conversation, you may be able to refer to them effectively as you resume the discussion on the return call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Prompt in Making Return Visits: </span><span class="font10">How many of those who accepted literature from you last month have you tried to visit again? Have weeks passed by without any further contact? Genuine concern for their everlasting welfare should move you to return as soon as possible, preferably within a few days, so that the conversation will still be fresh in mind. By returning promptly to further their interest, you may be able to forestall Satan’s efforts before he “comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.&quot;—Mark 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Preparation Is Essential: </span><span class="font10">Your effectiveness in making return visits is directly related to how well you prepare. Plan your approach before going. The back page of the April 1997 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> provides several presentations that may be used with good success when you offer the magazines or the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure. The next thing is to have some thoughts in mind to share when you return. What can be said when you follow up interest? How can a Bible study be started?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> When following up a discussion on what it will take to clean up the earth and make it a better place in which to live, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “On my previous visit, we agreed that drastic steps need to be taken before the earth can be made into a peaceful paradise. Do you think humans have what is needed to accomplish this task? [Allow for response.] Please note why it will be necessary for God to intervene in man’s affairs.” Read Psalm 37:38. Then turn to lesson 5 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure, and use selected portions of paragraphs 4-5 to show how God will fulfill this prophecy. Follow through by offering a Bible study using the brochure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> If you discussed God’s Kingdom and placed the “Require” brochure on the initial call, when returning you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “When we last spoke, we identified God’s Kingdom as being a real government that will rule the entire earth. The Bible shows that Christ Jesps will be its ruler. Can you see any benefits in having this kind of government and leader?” Allow for response. Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure to lesson 6. Using selected points in paragraphs 6-7 and the illustration on page 13, show what God’s Kingdom will do for mankind in the future. Read Daniel 2:44, and if appropriate, introduce the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book and offer a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* If you found someone who acknowledged that the world’s religions have created problems for humanity, you might ask this on the return visit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Have you ever wondered how we can know which religion has God’s approval? [Allow for response.] This brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font10"> gives the identifying marks of true religion.” Turn to lesson 13, and highlight the five italicized points in paragraphs 3-7. You may continue by saying: “In addition to finding the true religion, we must find out what God requires of us individually.” Read John 4:23, 24. Offer to discuss this further. Turn to lesson 1 in the brochure, and demonstrate how we study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup> When you return to continue a discussion about family happiness, you could say something similar to the follotving: </span><span class="font10">■ “When we first met, I shared with you the secret of family happiness, which is to apply the counsel found in God’s Word, the Bible. When it comes to addressing the needs of a modem family, do you believe that the Bible is out-of-date or up-to-date?” Allow for response. Present the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font10">book. Turn to chapter 2, and read the quotation in paragraph 13. Using the points in paragraph 3, offer a family Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> By keeping accurate records, making essential preparation, and returning promptly to further their interest, we can demonstrate the kind of neighbor love that will attract them to the way of salvation—Matt. 22:39; Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>

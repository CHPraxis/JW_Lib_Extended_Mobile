<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">December 1997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 40, No. 12</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Speak About Jehovah Every Day</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> People enjoy talking about whatever they hold dear to their heart, for out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks. (Luke 6:45b) What is close to our heart? The psalmist wrote: “Let my own tongue utter in an undertone your righteousness, all day long your praise.” (Ps. 35:28) He had deep appreciation for Jehovah and counted it a real privilege to speak about God and to praise him on every occasion. Being intimately acquainted with Jehovah, the psalmist had many good things to exult over. (Ps. 35:9) How can we imitate his fine example?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Speak About Jehovah in Your Home: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah should be a daily topic of conversation within the family circle. Parents who have a strong love for Jehovah will naturally speak of him in all their activities. (Deut. 6:5-7) As they do, the children will observe that their father and mother live by faith and cherish the law of God. The children will then view the family Bible study as a genuine expression of their parents’ godly devotion.—2 Pet. 3:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Speak About Jehovah With Your Brothers: </span><span class="font11">During our weekly theocratic routine, we have many opportunities to feed our minds and hearts on spiritual food. We are never lacking for good things to tell. (Luke 6:45a) Is there a point you gleaned from your personal study or weekly Bible reading that you especially enjoyed? Share it with your brothers, thereby helping them to increase their love for Jehovah.—Ps. 35:18; Heb. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Speak About Jehovah to Others: </span><span class="font11">In our everyday dealings with people—at work, in school, and with unbelieving family members—it should be readily apparent that our focus in life is the bearing of witness about Jehovah. Rather than be tainted with crude and coarse expressions of the world, our speech should exalt God. Daily, at every opportunity, speak to others about the good news he has commissioned us to preach. —Acts 5:42; Col. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As true worshipers of Jehovah, may we daily seize occasions to speak about our incomparable God, Jehovah.—Ps. 106:47.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>You Are Missed!</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> From time to time, we may miss one or more congregation meetings, feeling that ‘nobody will miss me; they won’t even notice I’m not there.’ That is not true! Like any member of our physical body, each of us plays a vital role in the functioning of the congregation. (1 Cor. 12:12) Our absence from a weekly meeting can affect the spiritual well-being of others who attend. If you are not there, be assured—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">you are missed!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Vital Role You Play: </span><span class="font11">Paul longed to associate with his brothers. Romans 1:11, 12 explains why: “That I may impart some spiritual gift to you . . . that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” Likewise, by our comments, our parts on the meeting, and our very presence, we do much to build one another up to continue in a faithful course.—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Do you not look forward to seeing others at congregation meetings? You listen closely to their comments and appreciate their expressions of faith. Their spiritual gifts contribute to your upbuilding. If they were not present at the meeting, you would feel that something important was missing. Your brothers and sisters feel the same way about you if you are not present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> The Vital Role Meetings Play: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> once commented on how vital the meetings are for our spiritual survival, saying: “In this strife-torn, immoral world, the Christian congregation is a real spiritual refuge..., a haven of peace and love. Therefore, be a regular attender at all of its meetings.” (w93 8/15 11) Each day, we are confronted by situations that drain us spiritually. If we are not careful, we could become so absorbed in our own anxieties that we might lose sight of the more important spiritual concerns. All of us are dependent on one another for the encouragement we need in order to remain united and zealous in God’s service.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Our attendance at meetings is vital. Illness or unforeseen occurrence may keep us away occasionally. Otherwise, let us be determined always to be counted among the congregated throngs who praise Jehovah together!—Ps. 26:12.</span></p>

What are some ways to witness informally? (Invite some to relate experiences of witnessing informally.) (3) Why should the congregation strive for good coverage of its assigned territory? Where territory is plentiful, what is the advantage of having a personal territory? (4) How do we benefit from arrangements for group witnessing? How can we plan our witnessing activity to make sure that we make the best use of our time?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>We Ought to Be Teachers, Not Just Preachers</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It has been observed that “Jehovah’s Witnesses have literally covered the earth with their witnessing.” How has this been possible? Not by human might or power, but by God’s spirit operating upon his servants as they make use of various provisions to fulfill their preaching and teaching commission.—Zech. 4:6; Acts 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The printed page is an effective means to accomplish our preaching work. Over the years, billions of books, booklets, brochures, magazines, and tracts have been printed and distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses to help make known the Kingdom good news. Reports in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1997 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> show that production of literature has reached record levels. To date, over 91 million copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> have been printed. In one year the number of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower and Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines printed in the United States rose by 7.1 percent. In Germany, magazine production rose by 35 percent. Over one third of the magazines produced there were for the Russian field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Why is so much literature needed? Worldwide, there has been a tremendous response to the encouragement given for us to witness wherever people can be found. With more of us extending our witnessing work—in public places, on the streets, and in business territory—greater amounts of literature are being placed with people who show some interest. Many of these have rarely, if ever, had the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message previously. To meet this need, congregations keep on hand a variety of publications for use in all features of the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What Is Our Goal in Distributing Literature? </span><span class="font11">Our goal is not just to place literature. The commission to make disciples involves two aspects—preaching and teaching. First, we have the privilege of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">preaching</span><span class="font11"> the good news of the Kingdom, making people aware that it is the only hope for mankind. (Matt. 10:7; 24:14) Our Bible-based literature is a time-tested and effective means of stimulating interest and imparting knowledge about the Kingdom to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Second, if we are to make disciples, we must </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">teach</span><span class="font11"> all the things Jesus commanded. (Matt. 11:1; 28:19, 20) Again, the literature plays an important role in our sounding the truth down into the hearts of students, helping them to become disciples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Those who accept literature may be ‘hearers of the word,’ but it is unlikely that they will become doers of it if they are left on their own. (Jas. 1:22-25) Few will ever become disciples unless someone guides them. (Acts 8:30. 31) They need a teacher to help them prove to themselves the truth that is found in the Scriptures. (Acts 17:2, 3) Our goal is to help them progress to the point of dedication and baptism and to train them to become adequately qualified to teach others.—2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> The Greatest Need Is for More Teachers: </span><span class="font11">When we preach, we declare the good news publicly. Teaching, however, involves instructing someone progressively. While </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">preaching</span><span class="font11"> makes others aware of the Kingdom message, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">teaching</span><span class="font11"> helps individuals accept the good news and act on it. (Luke 8:15) A teacher does more than proclaim; he explains, reasons with good argumentation, offers proofs, and persuades.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> As many of us as possible ought to be teachers, not just preachers. (Heb. 5:12a) Distributing literature is a vital part of our work, but achieving the second objective of our ministry ultimately depends upon what we do as teachers. Although we can be pleased when we are able to place literature, to accomplish our ministry fully, we should not view a placement as our final goal. (2 Tim. 4:5) Placements are an effective means of opening the door to opportunities to teach the truth to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Make Return Visits to Start Bible Studies: </span><span class="font11">All of us have likely placed a number of books, brochures, and magazines, compiling a list of return visits. We should schedule a regular time to go back to stimulate interest. Our main purpose in returning is not just to place more literature but to encourage people to read and benefit from what they already have. How much spiritual progress would we ourselves have made had it not been that someone returned time and again to help us acquire accurate knowledge?—John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Follow up all interest with a view toward starting a Bible study either in the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font11"> or in the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font11"> These two publications present the Kingdom message in a form that is easily understood. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure contains a well-rounded-out study course, covering the basic teachings of the Bible. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book enables one to teach the truth in greater detail, yet with simplicity, clarity, and brevity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> The simplified teaching program, as explained in the insert of the June 1996 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> makes it easy for the teacher to instruct and for the student to learn. Keep a copy of that insert readily available to review teaching methods and techniques that have proved effective. Some of the suggestions it gives involve how to take a genuine personal interest in the student, how much material to cover in one session, how to handle questions that do not pertain to the subject, how both teacher and student can prepare in advance for the study, and how to direct the student to Jehovah’s organization. By following the suggestions, more of us, including newer ones, will be able to conduct progressive studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Reports of Good Success From the Field: </span><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font11">book have proved to be valuable aids in speeding up the process of making disciples. Upon receiving the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure, a brother in Bolivia immediately used it to start a study with a man. Four months later at the district convention, this student was among the happy candidates for baptism!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Many are being moved to dedicate then-lives to Jehovah after completing their study of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book. In one congregation in Angola, the number of Bible studies conducted by the publishers increased from 190 to 260 and meeting attendance doubled in number from 180 to 360 in only four months after the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book began to be used in that area. Shortly thereafter, it was necessary to form another congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>14</sup> After starting his first study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book, one brother said that conducting it is “simple if the conductor just asks the questions, reads some applicable scriptures, and makes sure that the student understands.” Although he always thought that only very qualified publishers could conduct progressive Bible studies and that he could never do it, he realized that he could, saying: “If I can, anyone can.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>15</sup> It is by conducting Bible studies as a part of our ministry that we accomplish the objective of making disciples. Those who have developed the ability to share in this aspect of the ministry find it truly satisfying and richly rewarding. May it be said of us that we also are “preaching the kingdom of God . . . and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech.”—Acts 28:31.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">To be schooled means to be “taught or drilled in a specific knowledge or skill.” Through the Theocratic Ministry School, we are constantly being trained in the knowledge of God. Also, our participation in this school allows us to develop our speaking and teaching skills. The school program for 1998 will afford us many opportunities to make further spiritual progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As you examine next year’s school schedule, you will note that occasionally Assignment No. 3 will be based on a Bible character as found in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Insight</span><span class="font11"> volumes. What is more, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font11"> book has been added to the curriculum for 1998, and Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 will cover it progressively. Whenever the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font11"> book is the basis for Assignment No. 4, a brother should handle it as a talk to the congregation. And, as a reminder, no one on the school program should go overtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Feature: </span><span class="font11">For our personal benefit, a “Supplemental Bible-Reading Schedule” is set forth in brackets right after the song number for each week. Although no parts on the weekly school program are based on it, make it your goal to follow it. This will enable you to get into the habit of reading the Bible daily if you are not already doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For more information about assignments, counsel, and written reviews, please read carefully the instructions found in the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1998,” as well as page 3 of the October 1996 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are not yet enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School, we invite you to enroll now. This unique school continues to play an important role in training humble and devoted servants of Jehovah to become better qualified as his ministers—1 Tim. 4:13-16.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> An estimated four billion Bibles have been printed in more than 2,100 languages and dialects, making God’s Word available to over 90 percent of earth’s population. Yet, there exists a famine in the world “for hearing the words of Jehovah.” (Amos 8:11) Many people who have a copy of the Bible either do not read it or do not understand its contents. How can we motivate them to use the Bible as a practical guide in their life?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In December we will offer the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font11"> Where interest is found, we may also offer the Bible translation that has benefited us for the past 47 years—the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> This can be done by illustrating its clear, modern speech. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture”</span><span class="font11"> book, page 328, paragraph 6.) We will demonstrate our keen appreciation for this gift from Jehovah by enthusiastically helping others to accept the Bible as God’s guide for all people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You could introduce a presentation by using the tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible.” You might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Even though the Bible is available to over 90 percent of the world’s population, few people regularly read it. What do you think is the reason?” Read the first two paragraphs of the tract, along with 2 Timothy 3: 16. Offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font11"> book. If the book is accepted, mention the donation arrangement.

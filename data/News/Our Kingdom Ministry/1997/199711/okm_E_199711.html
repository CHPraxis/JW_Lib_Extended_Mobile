<p><span class="font8">November 1997</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For United States of America</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Thel</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">'As a zealous preacher of the good news, Paul eagerly searched out territories where the need was greater, one of which was the city of Ephesus. He had such fine success preaching there that he wrote to fellow Christians: “A large door that leads to activity has been opened to me.” (1 Cor. 16:9) Paul continued to serve in that territory and helped many Ephesians to become believers. —Acts 19:1-20, 26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Today, a large door leading to activity has been opened to us. We have an invitation to assist congregations that are not able to work all their territory thoroughly every year. Thus our efforts can offset the need that exists in certain areas. —Compare 2 Corinthians 8: 13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Can You Serve Where There Is Greater Need? </span><span class="font8">Have you prayerfully considered the possibility of serving elsewhere? You may be able to help a congregation in your own city. Why not speak to the circuit overseer about the matter and see what he suggests? Or it may be that within your own congregation’s territory, there is a large deaf or foreign-language population that no one has been able to care for. In order to meet this need, could you exert yourself to learn their language? Then again, perhaps there is already another language group or congregation nearby that has been ‘begging the Master for more Kingdom workers.’ (Matt. 9:37, 38) If so, are you able to help out?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> In recent decades, thousands of Christian families have moved to other lands to have a fuller share in the harvest work. One couple who did this said: “We wanted to serve Jehovah where we could do the most good.” If you have this desire and find it possible to move elsewhere in this country or if you qualify to serve in another land, first discuss your prospects with the elders of your congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> If you wish to inquire of the Society about where a need exists, provide the Congregation Service Committee with a letter outlining your specific desire. They will attach their comments and send it to the Society. In any case, as long as the large door to activity remains open, may all of us continue to be busy in Jehovah’s service.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It is a cause for great joy when married couples are united in true worship. However, in many families only one of the marriage mates has accepted the way of the truth. How can we reach out to these non-Witness mates and encourage them to worship Jehovah along with us?—1 Tim. 2: 1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Understand Their Thinking: </span><span class="font8">Although some nonWitness mates may be opposed, more often than not the problem is one of indifference or misunderstanding. A person may feel left out or be jealous over his or her mate’s newfound spiritual interest. “Alone in the house, I felt deserted,” one husband recalls. “I felt as if my wife and children were leaving me,” says another. Sdme men may think that they are losing their family to a religion. (See the August 15,1990, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> pages 20-3.) That is why it is best, if possible, for the husband to be included with his wife in the home Bible study arrangement from the start.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Work as a Team: </span><span class="font8">One Witness couple effectively worked together in aiding married people into the truth. After the sister had established a study with the wife, the brother would pay the husband a visit. He would often be able to start a study with the husband.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Bo Friendly and Hospitable: </span><span class="font8">Families in the congregation can help by taking an interest in families not yet united in true worship. A few friendly visits may help the non-Witness mate to see Jehovah’s Witnesses as warm, caring Christians who have everyone’s best interests at heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> From time to time, the elders can review recent efforts that have been made to reach out to non-Witness mates and determine what more can be done in hopes of winning them to Jehovah.—1 Pet. 3:1, ftn.</span></p></li></ul>

We appreciate the hospitality of families who open their home for a book study. This may involve considerable preparation and inconvenience. When attending, we should display good manners and show respect and consideration, which would include the following: (1) We should wipe our feet carefully before entering, to avoid soiling floors or carpets. (2) Parents should supervise their children, making sure that they are well behaved and stay in the area of the home designated for the book study. (3) While the group may be small and the atmosphere somewhat informal, this is a congregation meeting and we should dress as we do when going to the Kingdom Hall. (4) Association after the meeting should be kept brief so that the household can have private time for itself. (5) While the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">householder where the study is held might choose occasionally to serve a light refreshment after the study, all should understand that such is neither expected nor required.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">When we meet people in the ministry who respond favorably, we desire to return to give them a further witness.

It would help to have a list of questions from which you could select the one that you feel might get the best response at a particular call.

Listen carefully as the householder expresses himself so that you can learn what is on his mind. Then draw attention to an appropriate point in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure, which was featured in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font8"> If you get a favorable re</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>a</sup>Here are some suggested presentations you could try when returning to those who showed interest in “Kingdom News” No. 35:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “You may recall the printed information I left with you recently. Its message touches on a vital issue dividing mankind today—a lack of love for others.” Draw attention to the evidence presented on page 2 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> under the heading “Love of Neighbor Has Grown Cold.” Then ask, “Do you think it is God’s purpose for mankind to live this way?” Allow for response. Turn to lesson 5 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure, and try to start a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “When we first met, I left you some information on the subject ‘Will All People Ever Love One Another?’ Do you think that such a world is possible?” Allow for response. Turn to lesson 6 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure, and read paragraph 6. Then read God’s promise at Micah 4:3, 4. If the householder appears interested, offer the brochure and a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “When I last visited you, I left some material entitled ‘Will All People Ever Love One Another?’ It contained an offer for a free home Bible study. I returned to show you the study aid that we use. [Show the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book.] </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">eif '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This book clearly explains when all people will love one another, and it answers other questions that you may wonder about: Why do we grow old and die? Why does God permit suffering? What happens to our dead loved ones?&quot; Then ask, “May I demonstrate the study course to you?” If the householder declines your offer, ask him if he would like to read the book on his own. If he would, leave a copy and explain that our worldwide Bible-educational work is supported by voluntary donations. Plan to return again.</span></p>

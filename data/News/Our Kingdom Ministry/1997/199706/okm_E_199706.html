<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">June 1997 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 40, No. 6</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Do Your Utmost”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When we dedicated ourselves to Jehovah, we promised to give our very best to him. Appropriately, the apostle Peter encouraged first-century Christians to do their utmost in making sure of their standing before Jehovah. (2 Pet. 1:10) We surely want to do our utmost to please Jehovah in serving him today. What does this entail? As our relationship with Jehovah deepens and we meditate on all that he has done for us, our heart moves us always to do our best in his service. We want to improve the quality and, where possible, increase the quantity of our ministry. —Ps. 34:8; 2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> A young brother who wanted to do more in the ministry found that a regular study of God’s Word deepened his appreciation for Jehovah and instilled in him greater zeal. This motivated him to apply for the pioneer service. A sister who found it hard to talk to strangers practiced some of the presentations in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font9">book and soon began to enjoy greater success in her ministry. She was able to conduct a Bible study with a couple who accepted the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Rejoice in What You Can Do: </span><span class="font9">Some of us experience difficult circumstances such as poor health, family opposition, poverty, or unresponsiveness in the territory. Many other problems that are common in these last days may hinder our service. (Luke 21:34, ftn.; 2 Tim. 3:1) Does this mean we have failed in our dedication to Jehovah? Not if we are serving him to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font9"> utmost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> It is not wise to judge ourselves based on what others are able to accomplish. Instead, the Scriptures encourage us to “let each one prove what his own work is.” Giving of ourselves fully to the extent that we are personally able pleases Jehovah and gives us “cause for exultation.”—Gal. 6:4; Col. 3:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> May we heed Peter’s words to ‘do our utmost to be found finally by God spotless and unblemished and in peace.’ (2 Pet. 3:14) That spirit will make us feel secure and will bring us the peace of mind that only Jehovah can give.—Ps. 4:8.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths—What Are Your Spiritual Goals?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah knows how important meaningful work and attainable goals are in bringing happiness. (See Genesis 1:28; 2: 15, 19.) Today, Jehovah has given his people the assignment to preach and to teach. We also have the ultimate goal of attaining everlasting life in Paradise. Along the way, we need to set progressive spiritual goals if we are to avoid misdirecting our energies and resources.—1 Cor. 9:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Realistic Goals for Young People: </span><span class="font9">Youths ought to have theocratic goals that are within reach according to their individual capabilities. (1 Tim. 4: 15) Some very young ones have achieved the goal of reciting the books of the Bible even before they learned to read. Through the family study, children learn to prepare for meetings so that they can meet the goals of making meaningful comments and enrolling in the Theocratic Ministry School. When children accompany their parents in field service, they learn to have a part in giving d witness as they progress toward the goal of becoming unbaptized publishers. Parents should keep before their young children the goal of dedication and baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you are a teenager, what do your spiritual goals include? “Remember, now, your Grand Creator” by focusing on the really important goals in life. (Eccl. 12:1; Ps. 71:17) Why not auxiliary pioneer during the months you have time off from school? Have you thought about taking up the ministry fulltime as a regular pioneer? What about learning a new language so that in the future you could assist a foreign-language group or congregation in your area or somewhere else? Many who are now serving at Bethel or as traveling overseers or missionaries set special full-time service as their goal when they were still in school. Why not do the same yourself?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> While still of tender age, strive to imitate Jesus’ example. Even at the young age of 12, he spoke freely about spiritual matters. (Luke 2:42-49, 52) Setting beneficial goals for yourself to do personal study, to read the Bible daily, and to fellowship regularly with mature Christians at meetings and in service will help you acquire the skill to teach others about God’s Kingdom the way Jesus did.</span></p>

Most of us plan extra activities during summer months, and these may include vacationing, visiting relatives, or enjoying recreation. How can we organize things so that theocratic activities are not neglected? Discuss the following: (1) Attending all three days of the district convention.

The urgent need now is to follow up placements and teach people the truth. When we contact them in public places, tactfully request their name and address so that a return visit can be made. We need to do more than just plant Kingdom seed; we must also water it. (1 Cor. 3:6-8) When seed is sown in fine soil, good teaching can help the person to get the sense of it.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Knowledge From God Answers Many Questions</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Before you came to an accurate knowledge of the truth, likely you had many questions about life that you were unable to answer. How happy you were to receive Bible-based answers to those questions! Now you are able to help others find those same answers. (Compare 2 Timothy 2:2.) You can share with them the knowledge of God that leads to everlasting life. (John 17:3) But how can you help someone appreciate the value of this knowledge? Well, think of the questions that the truth answered for you. What is it that truthseekers desire to know? Thinking along these lines can help you to offer the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> The following suggestions may help you when preparing for witnessing during June.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since many people wonder why there is so much suffering in the world, this approach might get a good response:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “When disaster strikes or when acts of crime and violence are on the increase, people often ask why such terrible things happen. What would be your answer?” Allow for and acknowledge the person’s response. Then turn to chapter 8 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and call attention to what is stated in paragraph 2. Explain that this book presents the Bible’s explanation as to why bad things happen, and say: “If you promise to read it, I would be pleased to leave this copy with you.” If the book is accepted, explain the donation arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When calling back where you placed the “Knowledge” book, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I am interested in the conclusion you reached about why there is so much suffering in the world. Do you agree with the Bible’s answer as outlined in the book?” Allow for response. Read paragraph 17 on page 77 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and offer to read Romans 9:14 from the householder’s Bible. Then say: “The good news is that God does not unjustly cause us pain and suffering. He has promised to give us everlasting life in peace and happiness. The first chapter in this book is entitled ‘You Can Have a Happy Future!’ I’d like to explain how that can be true for you and your loved ones.” Turn to chapter 1, and demonstrate our study method. Cover as much of the chapter as is appropriate under the circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might choose to use the introduction that appears on page 14 in the “Reasoning” book, under the heading “Old Age/Death”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Have you ever asked, ‘Is death the end of it all? Or is there something else after death?’ [Allow for response.] The Bible clears up any question we might have about death. [Read Ecclesiastes 9:5,10.] It also shows that there is a real hope for those who have faith. [Turn to paragraph 13 on page 84 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book; read and explain Jesus’ words found at John 11:25.] This entire chapter is devoted to answering the question, What happens to our dead loved ones? If you would like to read it, I can leave this copy with you.” Allow the householder the opportunity to make a donation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> When making the return visit, you could renew acquaintance and then say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Previously we talked about what happens when a person dies. Many people believe that any life after death will be in either heaven or hell. But have you ever thought about the possibility of the dead living again right here on earth? [Allow for response.] According to the Bible, resurrected ones will be among the meek who inherit the earth. [Read Psalm 37:11, 29, then discuss paragraph 20 on page 88 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book.] That hope has given comfort to millions of people who lived in fear of death. This book will help you understand the matter better. May I demonstrate how?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If you prefer a simplified presentation, you might try this one:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I would like to show you an illustration in this book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> Isn’t this a beautiful picture?” Open the book so that the householder can see pages 4-5. Allow for his response. Then read the words on page 5. Conclude by saying: “You may have this book to read for yourself. There is no charge for it, but we do accept small donations for our worldwide work.” Find out what would be a good time to return to follow up any interest that is shown.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> We have the knowledge from God that answers fife’s important questions. Prepare diligently, and Jehovah will bless your efforts to share this life-giving information with those who are seeking the truth.</span></p></li></ul>

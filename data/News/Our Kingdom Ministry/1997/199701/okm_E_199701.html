<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah wills &quot;that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) Although people are influenced to some extent by heredity, background, and environment, they have free will and can choose individually how they will use their life. They can do what is good and live, or they can do what is bad and perish. (Matt. 7:13, 14) How does this understanding affect our view of the people we approach with the Kingdom good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We should not presume that a person’s interest in the truth is dictated by factors such as national or cultural background or by social position. The truth can appeal to those with either limited or advanced education, to those involved in political pursuits, and to professionals, atheists, agnostics, and even to notorious wrongdoers. People from all backgrounds and social levels have changed from their former course of conduct and are now in line for life in God’s new world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">(Prov. 11:19) Therefore, we should not hesitate to approach people in all walks of life with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Consider Those Examples: </span><span class="font10">A man had planned to kill his stepfather but did not. Later he decided to commit suicide but could not. After he was imprisoned for stealing and drug trafficking, his marriage failed. Today this person is making an honest living and Is enjoying a happy marriage as well as a fine relationship with his stepfather. What made the difference? He studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and applied what he learned. Jehovah did not consider him to be beyond redemption.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A young woman’s fame as a TV actress did not bring her happiness. But having become impressed by the fine moral conduct of the Witnesses, she accepted a Bible study, and she was soon helping others to learn about the Kingdom good news. Everywhere she went in the door-to-door ministry she was recognized, but she happily explained that she wanted to be known as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses rather than as an actress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> When a Witness arranged for a Bible study with a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> subscriber, a neighbor heard about it and attended the study. The neighbor immediately recognized the truth for which she had been searching! She and her husband canceled a divorce decree they had been granted and made peace. She was deep into astrology and was attached to a spiritistic cult, but she readily threw away expensive books and everything else she owned that was associated with demonism. She soon started attending meetings and talking to relatives and friends about her newfound faith. Now she witnesses enthusiastically to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> We ought not to prejudge anyone. Rather, let us zealously share the good news with people everywhere. We have every reason to be confident that Jehovah, who “sees what the heart is,” will become the “Savior of all sorts of men.”—1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> True to the Bible's description of “the last days.” </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">most</span><span class="font10">^people. today have only “</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">a form^oTgodly devotion</span><span class="font10">.&quot; (2 Tim. 3:1, 5) This is because reli</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">gious leaders</span><span class="font10"> have failed to give genuine spiritual guidance to their flocks.

Many religious leaders do </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">not befieve the Bible</span><span class="font10">. They feel it is antiquated, and so they perversely promote tne t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">heory of evolution</span><span class="font10"> instead of the Bible’s teaching about a Grand Creator. Most clergymen do no</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">t even use God’s personal nam</span><span class="font10">e, and they raise no objections to having it eliminated from modem Bible translations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As was true of the religious leaders in Jesus’ day, today’s clergy are preaching in vain. (Matt. 15:8, 9) It is just as the prophet </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Amos foretol</span><span class="font10">d. There exists “a famine, not for bread, and a thirst, not for water, but for h</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">earing the words of Jehovah</span><span class="font10">.&quot; (Amos 8:11) More than anything else, people need the spiritual food in God’s Word.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> P</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eople must first hear</span><span class="font10"> the truth from the Bible in </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">order to learn</span><span class="font10"> about Jehovah and puffaith in him.

Selected Announcements from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font10"> Comment on October field service report for the country and for the local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Time to Renew the Advance Medical Directive/Release Card. Qualified elder discusses importance of filling out card completely and carrying it at all times. This document speaks for you if you are unable to speak for yourself in an emergency. (Compare Proverbs 22:3.) A new card needs to be filled out every year to give a current declaration on refusal of blood, since some doctors and others have claimed that documents older than one year may not reflect a person’s current conviction. After the meeting, all baptized publishers will be given the Advance Medical Directive/Release card, and those with unbaptized minor children will receive an Identity Card for each child. Explain that these cards are not to be filled out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home but NOT signed. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done following the next Congregation Book Study, under the supervision of the book study conductor. He will check to see that all assigned to his group received a card and have needed assistance. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. Anyone missing at that time will be assisted by conductors/elders at the next Service Meeting until all baptized publishers have their cards properly filled out and signed. (Review letter of October 15, 1991.) By adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive to use for themselves and their children. Refer to Question Box of the December 1995 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font10"> Explain that the healthcare power of attorney (proxy) form provided by the Society is a legal document recognized by medical and legal personnel and that when it is properly filled out, it offers additional legal assurance that one’s wishes will be respected on blood and other health-care and end-of-life decisions. Baptized publishers may obtain a copy of this document from the secretary. (Unlike the Advance Medical Directive/ Release card, which is renewed annually, the health-care power of attorney (proxy) form needs to be replaced only when you elect to make a change In It.) Exercising insight in caring for these vital details will merit good from Jehovah. —Prov. 16:20.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1997 “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere.” (Ps. 84:10) When the psalmist worshiped at Jehovah’s temple, he could sense the presence of the almighty God. When the nation gathered for the annual festivals and true worshipers swelled Jerusalem, the Israelites would find sweet fellowship as they congregated in the courtyard of the temple. They were reminded of their national unity as the only people on earth on whom Jehovah bestowed his blessing and favor. Each year, we have the opportunity to share in similar feelings of unity and joy with thousands of our brothers and sisters. In our time annual district conventions are one of Jehovah’s ways of bringing his people together for instruction and fellowship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Caring for the large numbers of Jehovah’s people who lived in and around Jerusalem during the festivals required organization. Maintaining order and peace likely required the giving of instructions regarding accommodations, meeting times, and other arrangements. Since these matters concerned their true worship, the Israelites would joyfully follow these instructions.—Ps. 42:4; 122:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Hundreds of brothers have already spent tens of thousands of hours organizing convention departments, meeting hotel personnel and negotiating with them, working with building personnel at nearly 70 convention cities, preparing and mailing Recommended Lodging Lists, and so forth. These brothers work closely with the Society’s Convention Office to coordinate the many details associated with operating a convention. We may not personally see the tremendous amount of time, effort, and expense that goes into our annual district conventions, but all of us certainly appreciate the selfsacrificing spirit of each of these faithful brothers, do we not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> As preparations continue for our 1997 “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention, we have some points that require your kind attention and serious consideration. Your cooperation will show your personal appreciation for all the arrangements made in your behalf. Although some of these matters have been discussed before, it is important for each one of us to see clearly our responsibility before Jehovah in supporting our convention arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> When to Make a Hotel Reservation: </span><span class="font10">At the Service Meeting for the week of December 30, the Society directs that your district convention assignment letter be read to the congregation. Mailed separately by the local Rooming Department, the Recommended Lodging List for your convention will be posted on the congregation information board after the meeting that night. The elders have been keeping the district convention assignment and the Recommended Lodging List in strict confidence until this Service Meeting. No reservation calls to ANY hotels, by the elders or anyone else, are to be made until after the Service Meeting when the district convention assignment letter is read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> So that everyone will be able to obtain a room, the Society has instructed each Rooming Department to place all hotels available for the upcoming convention on the first Recommended Lodging List. Only if those hotels are filled will new hotels be added to subsequent lists. Sometimes, brothers have waited until the second or third Recommended Lodging List to make their hotel reservation. Procrastination may be the reason for this, or perhaps they anticipated that a preferred hotel would show up on a later list. Making reservations at the last minute causes two problems for the Rooming Department. First, it is not possible for the Rooming Department to determine when there is a need for additional rooms. Second, since all Watchtower convention reservations must be received before a cutoff date, there may be no rooms available for those who wait too long to make their reservation. Therefore, we are asking that you make your reservation during January from the first Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If the hotel you have selected is full, call another until you have a reservation. If you have called all the hotels on the list and no rooms are available, inform</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Making Your Hotel Reservation</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Call hotel during regular business hours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Ask reservation clerk for a confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Make your deposit. Write the confirmation number on your check or money order. Do NOT send cash.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. If you pay by check or money order, contact hotel in two weeks to verify that your deposit has been received. </span><span class="font10">your congregation secretary and he will contact the Rooming Department at the telephone number shown at the top of each Recommended Lodging List. The brothers in the Rooming Department will work with the hotels to secure additional rooms. A new list will then be mailed to your congregation. Please wait for the new list to make your hotel reservation. When you make a reservation, always ask for a confirmation number from the hotel. Provide this confirmation number to the desk clerk when you check in at the hotel.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, JANUARY 1997</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Unless the Recommended Lodging List specifically states otherwise, you should plan for a maximum of four adults in a room. Some hotels have informed the Rooming Departments that five, six, and seven adults have been sleeping in the same room. Because of fire and safety regulations, this not only is dangerous but is against the law in most cities. It also places an unfair demand on the hotel and staff for extra towels, linens, and so forth. Therefore, when planning your rooming needs, do not exceed the maximum number of people allowed in the hotel room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Sending Deposits to Hotels: </span><span class="font10">The Society’s agreement with each hotel states that our delegates will secure their reservation with a deposit. It further says: “Reservation is guaranteed upon receipt of deposit.” So the only way to guarantee a room reservation is if your deposit is received by the hotel. Last year, some brothers arrived at their hotels only to find that their reservation had been canceled weeks before the convention. Without a deposit, the hotel has the right to give your room to someone else, and a one-night deposit is a requirement of our rooming arrangement. For each room reserved, a one-night deposit must be made within ten days of making your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> We do not recommend sending cash in the mail. It can be stolen, and there is no proof your money was received. If you send a check or a money order, write your confirmation number on the front of it, and contact the hotel about two weeks later to confirm that your deposit was received. If you provide a credit card number for your deposit, you should tell the reservation clerk that you want the deposit tb be charged to your credit card immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Changing Hotel Reservations or Making Reservations at More Than One Hotel: </span><span class="font10">Before the convention, the Rooming Department calls each hotel on the list to find out how many rooms have been reserved by our delegates. Doing this every two or three weeks enables the Rooming Department to determine if sufficient hotel rooms have been arranged for the convention. In some cities last year, as the convention approached, hotels that started out with many reservations received numerous cancellations, or delegates with reservations did not show up at all. Where did these brothers and sisters go?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> It is apparent that new reservations were made with hotels closer to the convention site and previous reservations were dropped. Because of this, some hotels are asking for at least a two-night guaranteed reservation; otherwise they will refuse to book rooms for Watchtower conventions. Since this creates problems for the hotels and the Rooming Department, we are asking that once you make a reservation, do not switch your reservation to another hotel, even if one that is closer or more desirable appears on a subsequent list. (Matt. 5:37; compare Psalm 15:4.) That hotel has been added because there are brothers and sisters who still need rooms. It was not added to provide upgrades for those who already have rooms reserved. Whether you have a reservation at a hotel 5 minutes or 25 minutes from the convention site, you will still be spiritually fed and will enjoy the association of your brothers and sisters, will you not? It is our goal to reduce the number of lists sent out by the Rooming Departments each year and to simplify rooming arrangements. This can be accomplished only if everyone cooperates with the principle set forth at 1 Timothy 6:8: “So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> It is equally important to reserve only the hotel rooms you will actually use during the convention. Although it may be desirable to have a larger group stay together at the same hotel, this is not a necessity. Unless you have agreed to do so beforehand and you submit definite names, please do not reserve rooms for other delegates. This artificially inflates the number of rooms reserved for the convention and makes it harder for other delegates to make a reservation from the first list. Each room should be reserved in the name of one of the people who will occupy it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> Of course, if you experience a problem with a hotel during the convention, please bring this to the attention of the local Rooming Department at the convention. For any difficulties experienced before or after the convention, you can contact the Rooming Department, using the address and telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. Describe the difficulty in detail, including the steps you have taken to remedy the matter, so that the brothers may assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Using Hotels Not on the Society’s Recommended Lodging List: </span><span class="font10">The Society is making an effort to arrange conventions in locations that are more convenient for our brothers and sisters. In 1996, conventions were held in 11 additional locations. Some of these cities had not hosted a Watchtower convention in over 20 years. As a result, the Society has received many letters expressing appreciation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Although the convenience of our convention locations permits many brothers to commute to and from the convention site, hotel accommodations remain a necessity. Last year, 1,076 hotels were used at the 198 conventions held in 65 different cities. In each convention city, a team of brothers contacted many local hotels in an effort to negotiate the best possible room rates for the convention delegates. After months of negotiating, the hotels that agreed to work with the convention’s room rates were included on the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> In every city, these brothers contact many hotels that refuse to work with the Watchtower convention. It is understandable that some hotels do not anticipate having space because of other business. Of the many reasons given, however, one that is frequently heard is: “Why should we negotiate lower rates? Your people stayed with us this year at higher rates, and we expect them back next year as well.” Since the hotel is in business to make money, it is difficult to ask them to accept less than they are already receiving from our delegates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> Eachyear, we appeal to the brothers to make reservations only at hotels on the Society’s Recommended Lodging List. Several things are accomplished by heeding this direction:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>19</sup> Savas money for our brothers and sisters, the majority of whom have limited resources:</span><span class="font10"> When hotels cooperate with the Society’s arrangement, room rates are lower for our brothers. Instead of our resources going to the hotels, they can be put to better use supporting the families of our brothers and sisters and the worldwide work. Even if we personally can afford more expensive accommodations, we should support the efforts of the Rooming Department by using only hotels from the Recommended Lodging List. This is the spirit of concern for others described at 1 John 3:17 and the principle behind 1 Corinthians 10:24. &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>20</sup> Rewards those hotels that cooperate with the Society’s arrangement:</span><span class="font10"> Since the Society has contracted with the hotels on the Recommended Lodging List, we have, in effect, promised them that they will receive our business. In this way they remain willing to participate in the future. f</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>21</sup> Provides incentive for other hotels to work with the rooming arrangement:</span><span class="font10"> When hotels not on the Recommended Lodging List are used and higher rates are paid, there is little motivation for those hotels to work with the Society’s arrangement. In time, even hotels that previously cooperated with the Society’s arrangement often refuse to do so because they find out that some of our brothers will pay higher rates. However, if delegates use only the hotels on the Recommended Lodging List, other hotels may see the value of cooperating at a later time.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Do’s</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ DO make your reservation during January.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■ DO identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■ DO make your deposit as soon as your reservation is made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■ DO reserve only the room(s) you will personally use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■ DO keep your first reservation.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>22</sup> Demonstrates obedience to the Society’s directions:</span><span class="font10"> It is this last point that should be one of our main concerns. Hebrews 13:17 says: “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account; that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you.” As our brothers make many arrangements for our district convention, we want them to feel that they have our full support. Since our cooperation in this matter is requested only two or three days each year, this is a fine way to support their efforts. Even if our personal choice is different, our good example, as seen by our brothers and the world, promotes a loving, united, and supportive spirit.—Phil. 2:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font10">The Society’s Special Needs Room Request form outlines the qualifications for submitting a Special Needs form: “If you are in good standing in the congregation and have special needs that cannot be cared for by the local congregation, you may request accommodations through the Convention Rooming Department.&quot; This provision is only for publishers in good standing, including those with well-behaved children, who have been approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Those with special needs are our brothers and sisters, and we want to be of assistance to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>24</sup> The elderly, the infirm, those in full-time service, or others may require assistance in attending the convention. Relatives, the elders, and others in the congregation who are aware of their unique circumstances can lovingly make the necessary arrangements, not shifting the responsibility of family and congregation to the convention organization. (Compare 1 Timothy 5:4.) Before filling out a Special Needs Room Request form, carefully read the information located at the bottom of the form. These requests should be sent to the Rooming Department as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font10">Each congregation is assigned to the nearest convention. Based on the number of publishers assigned to each convention, the Society estimates the attendance in order to arrange for sufficient seating, rooming, literature, and so forth. If you must attend another convention, you may need information regarding rooming and parking tickets, among other things. If so, you should ask the congregation secretary to provide you with the address of the convention headquarters for the convention you will be attending. This can be found on the reverse side of the Special Needs Room Request form. Be sure to enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your request for the current Recommended Lodging List or for any additional information you may need. If there is more than one convention held in that city, be sure to indicate the dates for the convention you will be attending.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> Conclusion: </span><span class="font10">Letters received by the Society after the district conventions each year provide ample evidence that our brothers and sisters appreciate the arrangements made for them. Regarding the rooming arrangement, a sister attending a convention in Ohio last year wrote: “The rate was exceptional—their regular rate was $79.00 per night. As soon as we identified ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses attending the Watchtower convention, they firmly quoted the price on our list! We thanked Jehovah for such a provision! Jehovah always provides for his people. Through his visible organization, we are always made to feel special. It was a great experience</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Program Times</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. &nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;4:50 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sunday 9:30 a.m. - &nbsp;&nbsp;3:50 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">for our family to attend the convention. It would not have been practical or possible without your assistance.” Like our sister, are we not grateful to Jehovah for his help in these ways?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>27</sup> It is clear to all of us that Jehovah is supporting the arrangement of annual conventions. Since many of the brothers traveling to district conventions require rooms, we can be assured that Jehovah will adequately provide for these needs. Since these matters concern our true worship, we should joyfully follow the instructions given. Proving that we are “faithful in what is least” puts us in line for receiving the grand blessings that await those whom Jehovah loves.—Luke 16:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>28</sup> Isaiah 33:20 says: “Behold Zion, the town of our festal occasions!” We can only imagine the happy crowds that were filling Jerusalem and that willingly responded to Jehovah’s command to “become nothing but joyful. ” (Deut. 16:15) Our annual district conventions allow us the grand opportunity both to take in divine instruction and to enjoy the warm association of our brothers and sisters. May Jehovah bless your efforts as you prepare to attend the 1997 “Faith in God’s Word” series of district conventions!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 2, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Use Education to Praise Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Sunday, March 23, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font10"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that day, appropriate adjustments should be made for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study to be conducted at another time. Circuit overseers will need to adjust their meeting schedule for the week according to local circumstances. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested people find it inconvenient to attend. Nor should the schedule be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for interested ones, or enjoy a general interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The special public talk for the 1997 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 6. An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The body of elders should be aware that the following adjustments are needed when the congregation attends local assemblies: When a special assembly day program is scheduled, the congregation should have all the normal meetings throughout the week, except that the Public Meeting and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study are canceled. When scheduled to attend a circuit assembly, the congregation will also cancel the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting, only the Congregation Book Study will be held locally during that week.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">■ Why should we report our field service activity promptly each month?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of us feel a sense of Joy when we hear about good things being accomplished in preaching the Kingdom message. (See Proverbs 25:25.) Acts 2:41 reports that following Peter’s stirring discourse on the day of Pentecost, “about three thousand souls were added.” A short time later, that number had grown to “about five thousand.” (Acts 4:4) How exhilarating those reports must have been to the first-century Christians! We react the same way to encouraging reports today. We are thrilled to hear about the success our brothers enjoy In preaching the good news worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since much time and effort are involved in compiling such reports, the cooperation of every Kingdom publisher is essential. Are you conscientious about turning in your report promptly each month?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reports of Increases bring us much Joy. Additionally, reports help the Society to monitor the progress of the worldwide work. Decisions have to be made as to where more help may be needed or the type and amount of literature to be produced. Elders in each congregation use field service reports to determine where Improvement can be made. Good reports are upbuilding, motivating all of us to examine our own ministry for possible improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All publishers need to appreciate their individual responsibility to turn in a field service report promptly each month. Congregation Book Study conductors are in a good position to remind the publishers of this responsibility, since they are also alert to give personal assistance to those who may have some difficulty sharing in the field service regularly each month. This reminder could be given at the last book study each month or at another appropriate time. If there is no opportunity to turn in field service reports at the Kingdom Hall, the Congregation Book Study conductor can collect them and see that they are given to the secretary in time to be included with the congregation’s regular monthly report to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our diligence in faithfully reporting our field service activity promptly makes the load lighter for those responsible for our spiritual well-being.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Qualified and Equipped to Teach Others</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When Moses was appointed as Jehovah’s representative, he did not feel qualified to declare God’s word to Pharaoh. (Ex. 4:10; 6:12) Jeremiah revealed his lack of confidence in being able to serve as Jehovah’s prophet, telling God that he did not know howto speak. (Jer. 1:6) Despite their initial lack of confidence, both of those prophets proved to be fearless witnesses for Jehovah. They were adequately qualified by God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Today, thanks to Jehovah, we have what we need to accomplish our ministry with confidence. (2 Cor. 3:4,5; 2 Tim. 3:17) Like a qualified mechanic with a full set of tools, we are properly equipped to accomplish our assigned ministry skillfully. In January we are offering any 192-page book that was published prior to 1984 and that the congregation may have on hand. Although these spiritual tools are not new, their Scriptural themes are still current and these books will help people to learn the truth. The following suggested presentations may be adapted to whichever book is being offered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> The subject of education may be used to create interest in God’s Word. You could initiate a conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “There is much emphasis today on the need for quality education. In your opinion, what kind of education should a person pursue to ensure the greatest happiness and success in life? [Allow for response.] Eternal benefits can be gained by those who take in knowledge of God. [Read Proverbs 9:10, 11.] This handbook [give title of the book you are offering] is based on the Bible. It points to the only source of knowledge that can lead to everlasting life.” Show a specific example in the book. If there is genuine interest, leave the book and arrange for a return visit. State that although the publication is left without charge, we will accept a small donation toward our worldwide ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When returning to a householder with whom you discussed the importance of Bible education, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “On my last visit, we discussed the Bible as being the source of education that can ensure our eternal future. Of course, it takes effort to learn what we need to know from the Scriptures. [Read Proverbs 2:1-5.) Many people find it difficult to understand some portions of the Bible. I would like to demonstrate briefly a method we have used extensively to help people learn more about basic Bible teachings.” Using the book that was left, turn to an appropriate place and briefly demonstrate a Bible study. If the householder desires to have a regular study, explain that you will return with our study aid </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">* Many people are troubled by the suffering of millions of the world’s children. Perhaps you can help the householder to see how God views this plight, by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “No doubt you have seen news reports about children around the globe who are hungry, sick, and neglected. Why have concerned organizations not been able to improve the situation? [Allow for response.] God wants only what is best for humans. Note what he promises for children and adults, as recorded in the Bible. [Read Revelation 21:4.] This book [mention the title] provides more details about a world of God’s making where suffering will cease.” If possible, open to an illustration that depicts Paradise, and discuss it.

<p><span class="font10">■ “When I was here recently, you expressed .concern about the plight of children who suffer because of broken homes, famine, sickness, and violence.

You will no doubt find Jesus’ thoughts about what to pray for to be a helpful guide.” Read Matthew 6:9, 10, pointing out the chief concerns featured by Jesus in his model prayer. Show chapter 16, &quot;How You Can Draw Close to God,” in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, and ask if you can demonstrate how to study the material.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Faithfulness Is Rewarded</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> At Hebrews 11:6 we are told that God “becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.’ One way in which he rewards his devoted servants who have been ‘faithful in a few things’ is by ‘appointing them over many things.’ (Matt. 25:23) In other words, Jehovah often rewards good work by giving his faithful witnesses additional privileges of service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul’s faithfulness was rewarded by his being assigned to a ministry that took him into the cities and villages of Europe and Asia Minor. (1 Tim. 1:12) Although much effort was involved in fully accomplishing his ministry, Paul highly esteemed the privilege he had received. (Rom. 11:13; Col. 1: 25) He showed his heartfelt appreciation by earnestly looking for opportunities to preach. By his zealous activity, he clearly showed that he was living his faith. His example moves us to treasure our privileges of service.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah Ha* Given U* a Ministry: </span><span class="font7">How do we show the same view of this privileged reward that Paul showed? We look for ways to increase our share in the ministry. We take advantage of every opportunity to witness informally as well as from door to door. We follow up on all not-at-homes and make return visits on all who are interested. And we keep the appointments we make to conduct home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Regarding our ministry, Paul admonished: “Be at it urgently.” (2 Tim. 4:2) Something that is urgent calls for immediate attention. Do we go about our ministry in an urgent fashion, giving it priority in our lives? For example, we would not want to allow our recreational activities and other personal pursuits on the weekend to interfere with the time we ought to devote to the field ministry. Since we are convinced that the end of this system is fast approaching, we are also convinced that preaching the good news of the Kingdom is the most important work we can do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Our faithfulness to God is marked by our being true and loyal to him and constant in the work he has assigned us. Let us fully accomplish our ministry, so that Jehovah will reward our faithfulness in a large way.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness Wherever There Are People</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Recognizing the role God’s spirit played in his ministry, the apostle Paul stated: “God kept making it grow.” He also acknowledged: “We are God’s fellow workers.” (1 Cor. 3:5-9) This is a marvelous privilege. How can we demonstrate publicly that we appreciate being fellow workers with God? By declaring the good news to all whom we meet in the house-to-house work and everywhere else.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> We are commanded to “make disciples of people.” (Matt. 28:19) If we contact only a few people when we share in the ministry, we may tire quickly and feel we have accomplished little. On the other hand, we enjoy our ministry most when we are able to find many people and converse with them. This can be rather challenging, since it requires some initiative on our part to go wherever the people are so that we can make contact with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Practical Example*: </span><span class="font7">We can witness to people at markets, parks, rest stops, and transportation terminals. When you ride public transportation, are you prepared to give a witness along the way? Two Witnesses who were riding in a crowded bus to their meeting for service carried on a conversation about the picture of Paradise in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book, discussing God’s promises for the future. As they had hoped would happen, a young man standing close by listened in and was impressed by what he heard. Before leaving the bus, he accepted a book and requested that someone visit his home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Many publishers have found joy in doing informal witnessing. One sister went to the local shopping center on an afternoon and approached people who had finished their shopping but who did not appear to be in a hurry. She placed all the literature she had in her bag. One man who was waiting in his car was happy to receive the magazines from her. He had attended meetings before, and their conversation rekindled his interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> It is a privilege to exalt Jehovah’s name. By demonstrating our zeal for the preaching work, we show that we have not missed the purpose of God’s undeserved kindness toward us. Because “now is the especially acceptable time” to help others, let us go wherever there are people and witness to them about Jehovah’s “day of salvation.”—2 Cor. 6:1,2.</span></p>

(Prov. 22:6; 2 Tim. 3:14,15) Some parents feel that serious Bible education for children should not be provided until they are old enough to make their own decisions. In such cases many children have been lost to the world. Spiritual instruction should begin in infancy. (p97 3/8 26-7; w88 8/112-13) Interview married couple who show concern about the spirituality of their children. Show how father takes the lead but that both parents do their part in providing a consistent, thorough program for teaching their children. Couple relate what they have been doing in an effort to teach their children the truth, applying suggestions the organization has provided on having a good, practical program for teaching at home.

No one will want to miss out on the group study of this practical Scriptural guide for a happy family life.

<p><span class="font7">The entire first chapter will be considered the first week of the study, since it contains few unquoted scriptures. For the same reason, chapter 15 will be considered in one session. However, all other chapters will be divided into two parts, with about half of a chapter being considered each week. convenient time for many to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Thus, there will be sufficient time to read and discuss all cited scriptures as well as to examine carefully the application of all quoted scriptures in each paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An important feature of the study will be a discussion of the material in the teaching box at the conclusion of each chapter. Therefore, ample time should be allotted to consider the questions and the cited scriptures in the box.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“Keeping Jehovah’s Day Close in Mind” is the theme of the two-day circuit assembly program beginning in September. (2 Pet. 3:12) It is designed to arouse our sense of urgency. Earth’s inhabitants will soon experience Jehovah’s judgments. Who will survive “the great day of God the Almighty”? Only those who remain spiritually awake and who establish a life pattern of “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.”—Rev. 16:14; 2 Pet. 3:11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Baptism is essential for a person to survive Jehovah’s day. (1 Pet. 3:21) Publishers who desire to be baptized at the assembly should tell the presiding overseer, who will make the necessary arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A four-part symposium, “The Sort of Persons We Ought to Be,” will clearly show what actions are involved in keeping close in mind the presence of Jehovah’s day. The public talk, “Act Wisely as Jehovah’s Day Nears,” will explain what it means to ‘seek Jehovah, righteousness, and meekness,’ so as to be a survivor. —Zeph. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit assembly will conclude with two motivating talks by the traveling overseers, entitled: “Does Your Life Center Around the Truth?” and “Planning Ahead With Jehovah’s Day in Mind.” These discourses will move us to examine our life and make any needed adjustments. Bible prophecy and world events clearly indicate that Jehovah’s day is near. This assembly program will encourage us to ‘keep our senses and be watchful.’ (1 Pet. 5:8) Make definite plans to attend both days.</span></p>

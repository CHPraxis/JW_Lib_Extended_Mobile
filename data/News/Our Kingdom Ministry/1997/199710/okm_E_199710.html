<p><span class="font8">'A beautiful, stirring, and heartwarming message is to be proclaimed worldwide in 169 languages. What is this message? And how will it be delivered?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> The message is about neighbor love. It is to be found in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35, entitled “Will All People Ever Love One Another?” This </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font8">briefly examines the present state of affairs throughout the world, showing that it is the lack of love among people that is the root cause of so much heartache and pain. It explains why, in our day particularly, neighbor love has cooled off and what this means for the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> At the same time, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35 shows that true neighbor love exists among millions living in today’s world. It identifies those who are sharing in the revival of primitive Christianity—first-century worship, which was marked by love of neighbor as taught by Jesus Christ.—Luke 10:25-37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35 concludes with an explanation of how the entire world of mankind will soon be practicing neighbor love under the administration of God’s Kingdom by Christ. Those reading this message are encouraged to obtain the brochure </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font8"> and learn how to become a part of this earth-wide loving arrangement that is described in detail in God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Who Will Deliver This Message? </span><span class="font8">Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide will be sharing this message of neighbor love with their acquaintances, neighbors, and relatives during the months of October and November. All who qualify are encouraged to share in the public distribution of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The ultimate goal of this campaign is to stimulate people’s interest in having a Bible study in either the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure or the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book. Additionally, a wholehearted effort on the part of each one of Jehovah’s servants will produce a grand witness to the God of love, Jehovah, and to his Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Apathy is a lack of feeling or emotion, an absence of interest or concern. It is one of the more common and more difficult attitudes we encounter in the ministry. How do you react to it? Has it caused you to slow down in your ministry? How can you overcome it so as to reach people with the Kingdom message?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> First, determine why the people in your territory are apathetic. Is it because they are disappointed with their political and religious leaders? Do they feel that there is no way out of the problems facing them? Are they skeptical about promises of something better? Are they unwilling to think about spiritual matters unless they can see immediate tangible benefits?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Highlight the Kingdom Hope: </span><span class="font8">There is no problem that the Kingdom will not solve. So when we can do so, we should speak about Kingdom promises, referring to key Scriptural statements, even if it is not possible or practical to show a Bible text. (Heb., 4:12) However, how can we get the conversation to that point?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> People need to understand the purpose of our call. They need to realize that we are there out of love of neighbor and concern for the community. We could ask a well-thought-out question such as, “What do you think is the solution to [a problem affecting the community]?” If one approach does not work, try another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> In one very affluent territory where householders were indifferent to the Kingdom message, publishers endeavored to find an introduction that would arouse interest. When featuring the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book, one couple tried this introduction: “Do you feel that a good education is important for success in the world today? Do you agree that a well-rounded education would include knowledge of the Bible?” In one afternoon they placed three books, one of which was with a woman who later said she had read the entire </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book and agreed to a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> When you encounter apathy, try different approaches, ask thought-provoking questions, and draw upon the power of God’s Word. You may thus be able to help others embrace our marvelous Kingdom hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During 1998 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> [&amp;il2], </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Pro-claimers of God’s Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> Uv], </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font8"> (1990 Edition) [si], </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</span><span class="font8"> [fcZ], </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness</span><span class="font8"> [/)/], and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the ScripturesVoiumes</span><span class="font8"> 1 and 2 [iZ-1, iZ-2] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.”</span><span class="font8"> When based on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font8"> book, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture”</span><span class="font8"> book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3-to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font8"> of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used. Illustrations, photographs, and charts found in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font8"> book may be commented on by the speaker and used as teaching aids. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">keep within the time limit.</span><span class="font8"> Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font8"> the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the schbol overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font8"> the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S-38a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/97</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This wifi be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, The Secret of Family Happiness,</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font8"> Volume 2. (See Assignment No. 4 for information on how to develop the material based on a Bible character.) The setting may be an informal witness, a return visit, or a home Bible study, and the participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student helps the householder to reason on and understand the material and in how the scriptures are applied. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. The student may determine whether or not to have the householder read certain paragraphs when considering the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font8"> books. Not the setting but the effective use of the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ASSIGNMENT NO. 4:5 minutes. When this assignment is based on information dealing with a Bible character, it will be assigned to a brother or a sister. When it is based on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font8"> book, it will be assigned to a brother. For each assignment a theme is set forth in the schedule. When this assignment is based on a Bible character, information can be found in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font8"> Volume 1 or Volume 2, under his name. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme of the talk and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of considering a Bible character is to show what can be learned from his example. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts as well as undesirable traits stand as strong warnings to turn Christians away from an improper course. When assigned to a brother, this talk should be given with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">•SUPPLEMENTAL BIBLE-READING SCHEDULE: This is set forth in brackets after the song number for each week. By following this schedule, reading about ten pages a week, the entire Bible can be read in three years. No parts on the school program or the written review are based on the supplemental reading schedule.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You a Full-Time Witness?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Would you answer yes to this question? Although not all of Jehovah’s dedicated servants can be enrolled in the full-time ministry, is it not reasonable to expect that all of us should view ourselves as his full-time Witnesses? Certainly we should.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> There is no such thing as a part-time Christian. Jesus said of his Father: “I always do the things pleasing to him.” (John 8:29) Paul, who felt the same way, urged us to “do all things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) By all means then, all of us should regard ourselves as full-time Witnesses of Jehovah. Our thinking in this way will influence us for good in every activity we pursue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Consider the Evidence: </span><span class="font8">Our appearance, speech, and conduct can indicate to other people that we are indeed Jehovah’s Witnesses. We are conscious of the need for a modest appearance, wholesome speech, and proper conduct whenever we are engaging in field service or attending Christian meetings. However, whether we are going to school, working at a secular job, or participating in recreation, everything about us should give evidence that we live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Jesus said: “A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. . . . Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matt. 5: 14-16) This should be true in everything we do and at all times. If we ever find that we are reluctant to give a witness because of where we are or what we are doing, we need to ask ourselves, ‘Am I serving Jehovah part-time or fulltime?’ May we never have to pass up an opportunity to talk to others about the good news of God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Remember, we honor and please Jehovah when we can answer the question, “Are you a full-time Witness?” with a resounding “Yes!”</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Give </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom Nows</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 35 Wide Distribution</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> October and November will be busy months for all of us. During the first 11 days of October, we will offer individual copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> Then, from Sunday, October 12, through Sunday, November 16, we will join in the worldwide distribution of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35. It will be our privilege to take an important message to all the people in our locality. It is the answer to the question, “Will All People Ever Love One Another?” During this special campaign, we will distribute </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35 on weekdays. On weekends, in addition to presenting </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font8"> we will feature the current issues of the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Who May Have a Share? </span><span class="font8">As usual, the elders will be at the forefront of the work. Everyone enjoys distributing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font8"> and no doubt a great many publishers will enroll as auxiliary pioneers during one or both months of the campaign. Other publishers will want to spend more time than usual in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Do you have a Bible student who is well along in his study of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book and who will soon qualify to engage in field service? Perhaps he could become an unbaptized publisher in time to engage in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> campaign. A simple presentation is all that is needed to introduce the tract. For example, one might say: “This message is so important that it is being distributed worldwide this month in 169 languages. I would like you to have your personal copy.” Even young children can have a fine share in this exciting work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Book study conductors should encourage every member of their group to have a full share in the distribution of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35. There also may be publishers who have become inactive but who would again be active in the service if they received the needed encouragement. In advance of the campaign, the elders should visit each of these to see what can be done to help them accompany experienced publishers in this feature of the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> When May We Meet for Service? </span><span class="font8">All this activity will call for group witnessing arrangements that are both convenient and practical. Wherever possible, meetings for service should be organized for each weekday, on the weekends, and in the evenings. They should be held at times that will enable publishers and pioneers to take full advantage of the witnessing period. Arrangements also may be made to meet in the late afternoons for the benefit of school students, shift workers, and others. The service overseer should ensure that there will be plenty of house-to-house and business territory on hand so that everyone can share fully in the work. Where there are many publishers in an area, they should be discreet about how many work in a given section of territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> What About Not-at-Homes? </span><span class="font8">We want to speak personally to as many householders as possible to explain why they should read </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> No. 35. So if no one is at home when you call, write down the address and call again at a different time of day. If by the last week of the campaign your efforts to contact these householders still have been unsuccessful, you may leave a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> at the door in a place where it will not be seen by passersby. In residential areas, be alert to offer </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font8">to individuals who may be walking along the street. When working rural areas and where there is more territory than can be covered during the campaign, a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> may be left at not-at-homes on the first call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• What Is Our Objective? </span><span class="font8">Congregations should endeavor to use their entire supply of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> to cover all their territory before the campaign ends on November 16. If your congregation’s territory assignment is quite large and if it is safe to work on your own rather than with a partner, you may find it practical to do so. This will enable you to reach as many deserving ones as possible with the good news. (Matt. 10:11) It may be advantageous to carry a few tracts in your hand and a Bible in your pocket or purse, rather than use a briefcase. Be sure to keep a good record of where interest is found.</span></p>

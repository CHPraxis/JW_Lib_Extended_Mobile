</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> At various times throughout mankind’s history, it was necessary for Jehovah to execute judgment upon his enemies. However, because of his mercy, he provided rightheart-ed ones with an opportunity for salvation. (Ps. 103:13) Their response determined their destiny.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> For example, prior to the Flood, in 2370 B.C.E., Noah was “a preacher of righteousness.” The ones who perished were those who ignored the divine warning. (2 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 11:7) Before the destruction of Jerusalem In 70 C.E., Jesus clearly outlined the action that would be needed for anyone to escape the devastation that was to befall the city. All who rejected his warning message suffered dire consequences. (Luke 21:20-24) Such divine warnings and judgments were repeated many times throughout history.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Modern-Day Warning Work: </span><span class="font15">Jehovah long ago declared that his anger would be unleashed against today’s wicked system and that only the meek ones would survive. (Zeph. 2:2, 3; 3:8) The time for preaching this warning message is fast running out! The “great tribulation” is just ahead, and meek ones are now being gathered. Indeed, the “fields” are “white for harvesting.” Hence, no other work can compare with this as to importance and urgency.—Matt. 24:14, 21, 22; John 4:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">’We must share in sounding the modern-day warning to others, “whether they will hear or will refrain.” This is a God-given assignment, which we dare not ignore. (Ezek. 2:4,5; 3:17,18) Our having a full share in this work provides a convincing demonstration of our deep love for God, our genuine concern for our neighbors, and our unshakable faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Now Is ths Time to Act: </span><span class="font15">After past judgments by Jehovah, wickedness always sprang up anew because Satan and his demons were still active. However, this time It will be different. Satanic influence will be eliminated. A global warning about an impending “great tribulation” will never again be needed. (Rev. 7:14; Rom. 16:20) We have the special privilege of being part of a never-to-be-repeated work. Now is the time for us to make the most of this opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> About his preaching activity, the apostle Paul, with great conviction, stated: “I am clean from the blood of all men.” (Acts 20:26) He did not feel bloodgullty through any failure to sound the warning. Why not? Because he could say of his ministry: “To this end I am indeed working hard, exerting myself.” (Col. 1:29) Let us enjoy the same satisfaction of sharing to the fullest extent possible in the work that will never be repeated!—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What About Your Relatives?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Most of us have a number of relatives who are not in the truth. How we long for such loved ones to join us on the road to life! Our concern for their everlasting future may be greater when they are members of our own household. Although we have tried for years to Interest them in the truth, we should not conclude that the situation is hopeless.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus did his preaching, “his brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him.” (John 7:5) At one point, his relatives thought he was insane. (Mark 3:21) Yet, Jesus did not give up on them. In time, his brothers accepted the truth. (Acts 1:14) His half brother James became a pillar In the Christian congregation. (Gal. 1: 18, 19; 2:9) If you would like to have the joy of seeing your relatives embrace the truth, do not stop trying to reach them with the Kingdom good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Ba Refreshing, Not Overwhelming: </span><span class="font15">When Jesus preached to others, his listeners felt refreshed, not browbeaten. (Matt. 11:28, 29) He did not overwhelm them with teachings that they could not grasp. To refresh your relatives with the waters of truth, give them a cup at a time, not a bucketful! A traveling overseer observed: “The best results are achieved by those who awaken curiosity in their relatives by witnessing in measured doses.” In this way, even opposers may begin to ask questions and eventually develop a thirst for the truth. —1 Pet. 2:2; compare 1 Corinthians 3: 1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">’ Many married Christians have effectively witnessed to their unbelieving mates by leaving literature open to material that might Interest them. One sister who did this also conducted a study with her children within the hearing of her husband, giving explanations that would benefit him. Sometimes she would ask him: “I learned such and such in my study today. What do you think about it?” Her husband finally accepted the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Be Respectful, Not Impatient: </span><span class="font15">One publisher commented that “even relatives have a right to their own views and opinions.” So we should show respect when they voice their thoughts or when they specifically ask us not to speak to them about the truth. (Eccl. 3:7; 1 Pet. 3:15) By being patient and loving and by being good listeners, we can look for appropriate opportunities to give a subtle witness. Such patience can be rewarding, as was seen in the case of a Christian husband who patiently endured his unbelieving wife’s mistreatment for 20 years. Once she began to change, he said: “How grateful I am to Jehovah that he helped me to cultivate long-suffering, because I can now see the result: My wife has started to walk on the path of life!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> What about your relatives? It may be that through your good Christian conduct and your prayers in their behalf, “you may win them to Jehovah.” —1 Pet. 3:1, 2, footnote.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> On Sunday, March 23, after sundown, we will celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. (Luke 22:19) This Is truly an event of great Importance!

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Wanted—100,000 Auxiliary Pioneers</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Can You Auxiliary Pioneer in March? April? May?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “Wanted 1,000 Preachers” was the title of an article published in the April 1881 issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower.</span><span class="font4"> It contained an appeal to all dedicated men and women, “to whom the Lord has committed a knowledge of His truth,” to use whatever time they could to share in spreading Bible truth. Those who could give half or more of their time exclusively to the Lord’s work were encouraged to volunteer as colporteur evangelizers—the forerunners of today’s pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Although times have changed since the 1800’s, one fact remains the same—God’s dedicated servants want to continue using as much time as possible in spreading the good news. Serving as auxiliary pioneers enables congregation publishers to improve their effectiveness as they put forth extra time in the Kingdom ministry.—Col. 4:17; 2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Ever since its inception, auxiliary pioneering has been enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of brothers and sisters. Enthusiasm for this feature of the pioneer ministry grew to the extent that a peak of more than 100,000 auxiliary pioneers was reached in the United States branch territory in April 1985! Three times since then, more than 100,000 publishers have shared as auxiliary pioneers during the month of April—in 1988, 1989, and 1992. The potential certainly exists to repeat this fine effort during the spring of 1997.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> We encourage you to have the goal of auxiliary pioneering during one or more of the months of March, April, and May. Why, include March? Because this year the Memorial of Christ’s death falls on Sunday, March 23. There is no better way that we could spend the weeks preceding the Memorial than to share zealously in the Kingdom-preaching work that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, instituted. With a great heap of witness being given in March, we can invite many interested persons to join us in the commemoration of Christ’s death. March will also be special in that, for the first time, we will be featuring the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness. </span><span class="font4">Additionally, the month of March contains five Saturdays and five Sundays, allowing for intensive weekend activity in the field service. Of course, during the months of April and May, a continued zealous effort in the ministry will allow us to follow up on the interest found and start new home Bible studies, using the brochure </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font4"> We will also cover our territory thoroughly, particularly on weekends, with the current timely issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Who Qualify to Auxiliary Pioneer?: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> page 114, explains: “Whatever your personal circumstances, if you are baptized, are of good moral standing, can arrange to meet the requirement of spending 60 hours a month in the field ministry and believe you could serve one or more months as an auxiliary pioneer, the congregation elders will be pleased to consider your application for this privilege of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Succeed as an Auxiliary Pioneer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">■ Be positive about your prospects</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">■ Pray to Jehovah to bless your efforts</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■ Invite another publisher to pioneer with you</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■ Work out a practical service schedule</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■ Order an ample supply of magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■ Support congregation arrangements for service</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■ Seek opportunities for witnessing informally </span><span class="font4">service.” Can you make room for this privilege in March? April? May?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, FEBRUARY 1997</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> A positive attitude on the part of the bodies of elders along with the wholehearted support of the rest of the publishers should make the response to this call for 100,000 auxiliary pioneers a resounding success. (Heb. 13:7) All family heads are encouraged to ascertain how many within their household can join the ranks of the auxiliary pioneers during one or more of the coming months.—Ps. 148:12, 13; compare Acts 21:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Do not be quick to conclude that auxiliary pioneering is beyond your reach because of your full-time secular work, school schedule, family responsibilities, or other Scriptural obligations. For some it may not be easy to take part; nevertheless, with good organization and Jehovah’s blessing, they can succeed. (Ps. 37:5; Prov. 16:3) Let the desire to share in pioneer service control your circumstances; do not let your circumstances control your desire to pioneer. (Prov. 13:19a) Hence, with a strong love for Jehovah and for fellow humans, many are able to adjust their weekly routine of life so as to expand their ministry a month at a time. (Luke 10:27, 28) Many blessings are in store for those who exert themselves vigorously in the Kingdom service.—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> What Auxiliary Pioneering Accomplishes: </span><span class="font4">The whole-souled effort that thousands of God’s servants put forth to auxiliary pioneer results in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a great shout of praise to Jehovah. </span><span class="font4">As these Kingdom proclaimers exert themselves to spread the good news to more people, they are drawn closer to Jehovah personally because they learn to be more dependent upon him for his spirit and blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Having auxiliary, regular, and special pioneers active in our midst produces </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a fresh spirit of vitality in the congregation.</span><span class="font4"> Their enthusiasm is contagious as they talk about their field experiences. This motivates others to reevaluate their own priorities and potential for having an expanded share in the all-important work of the ministry. A sister who was baptized at the age of 70 immediately began auxiliary pioneering on a continuous basis. When asked some years later why, at her age, she was still exerting herself so much in the ministry as an auxiliary pioneer every month, she said she felt as though the first 70 years of her life had been wasted, and she did not want to waste any of her remaining years of life!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Each participant in the auxiliary pioneer work develops </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">an improved skill in the ministry.</span><span class="font4"> One young witness admitted: ‘During early childhood I used to accompany my parents in their preaching activities. Field service was really fun. However, in time, it dawned on me that at school I stood out from the rest of the crowd. It then became awkward for me to speak to fellow students about the truth. When preaching from house to house, I began to dread the thought of meeting up with someone I knew from school. In my case I think the problem was fear of man. [Prov. 29: 25] After getting out of school, I decided to try pioneering on a temporary basis. As a result, preaching took on an appeal that it never had before. No longer did I view it as a fun activity, nor was it a heavy burden. On seeing my Bible students progress in the truth, I enjoyed a sense of deep satisfaction at the evidence that Jehovah God was backing my efforts.’ This youth went on to serve as a regular pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> From a practical standpoint, when many serve as auxiliary pioneers in the congregation, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a thorough coverage of the territory</span><span class="font4"> results. The brother who handles the assigning of territories can ask the auxiliary pioneers for their assistance in covering the seldom-worked sections. Packing a lunch and putting in a whole day of service will make it possible to work even the distant comers of the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Elders to Make Advance Preparations: </span><span class="font4">Throughout the next three months, arrangements should be made to schedule different kinds of witnessing activity at various times of the week, including late afternoon and early evening, so that as many as possible can take part. In addition to doing regular house-to-house work, include periods for street witnessing, working business territory, and calling on not-at-homes. By so doing, elders help those who are pioneering to share in service with the congregation at a time that will be most practical and convenient for the pioneers. The congregation should be well informed of all field service arrangements. The handling of meetings for service should be well organized. Additionally, adequate territory should be made available and ample magazines and other literature supplies should be ordered promptly.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Plan Your Personal Service Schedule: </span><span class="font4">One brother, who at first was apprehensive about auxiliary pioneering, said: “It really is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It just takes a good schedule.” On the back page of this insert, do you see a sample auxiliary pioneer schedule that would be practical for you? Fifteen hours each week for the ministry is all the time that is required of auxiliary pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> In order to serve as auxiliary pioneers, housewives and second-shift workers can often schedule their mornings for the field service. Schoolchildren and third-shift workers can generally devote late afternoons to the preaching work. Full-time secular workers have found it possible either to take off one day of work a week or to devote full weekends to the ministry, in addition to doing evening witnessing. Many whose field service is mostly limited to weekend activity choose months that contain five full weekends. This year, that is true of March, as well as August and November. Using the blank schedule on page 6 that is provided as a guide, give careful and prayerful thought to what will be a practical personal service schedule for your individual situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> One advantage of the provision to auxiliary pioneer is its flexibility. You can choose the months that you will pioneer, and you can serve as often as you desire. If you would like to auxiliary pioneer on a continuous basis but cannot do so, have you thought of enrolling every other month throughout the year? On' the other hand, some are able to serve continuously as auxiliary pioneers for extended periods of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> A Warm-Up for Full-Time Pioneering: </span><span class="font4">Many who have the pioneer spirit would like to serve as regular pioneers, but they wonder if they have the time, the circumstances, or the stamina for it. Undoubtedly most of those who are now regular pioneering first used auxiliary pioneer service as a warm-up for the full-time work. By increasing one’s auxiliary pioneer schedule just one hour each day, or one full day each week, it is possible to fulfill the regular pioneer schedule. To see if that is possible for you, why not try to devote 90 hours in the ministry during one or more months of auxiliary pioneering? At the same time, you will be developing return visits and Bible studies, which will allow you to enjoy a well-rounded pioneer ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> One sister enjoyed six years of continuous auxiliary pioneering. All that time it was her goal to enter the regular pioneer service. To that end, she tried four different secular jobs in hopes of creating a situation that would put the 90-hour requirement for regular pioneers within her grasp. Each month, she drew up one or two schedules in order to calculate whether it might be possible. But on examining them, she felt the full-time ministry wets beyond her reach. Still, she continued to ask Jehovah for his direction. Then one day while preparing for the Service Meeting, she read an article in the September 1991 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> that stated: “Rather than placing undue emphasis on the hour requirement, why not focus attention on the increased opportunity to share in the ingathering work? (John 4: 35,36)” She relates: “I reread this sentence five or six times, and I was quite sure that this was Jehovah’s answer. At that moment I made the decision to enter the regular pioneer service.” Although her part-time secular work schedule was far from ideal, she submitted her application to regular pioneer. A week later her schedule was changed, and she was given secular working hours that were just right for her. She concluded, “Is this Jehovah’s hand, or not?,” and added: “When you ask Jehovah for guidance and you receive it, do not run away from it—accept it.” If it is your earnest desire to regular pioneer, perhaps by the end of three months of auxiliary pioneering this March, April, and May, you will be convinced that you too can succeed in the full-time ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> We are certain that Jehovah will bless the zeal and will support the efforts of his people as they publish the good news of salvation during this special springtime period of activity. (Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:15) Will you answer the call for 100,000 auxiliary pioneers by having a share in March? April? May?</span></p></li></ul>

Then notify the elders about your circumstances and present location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The elders and ministerial servants play a crucial role in providing relief assistance. If advance warning of a disaster is given, as with some major storms, these brothers should ensure that everyone is In a safe location, and if time permits, should obtain and distribute supplies that may be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Afterward, book study conductors should locate each family and inquire of their well-being. The presiding overseer or another elder should be notified of the situation of each household, even if all is well. If someone has been ipjured, the elders will try to arrange for medical treatment. They will also provide any material things such as food, clothing, shelter, or household supplies that are needed. (John 13:35; Gal. 6: 10) The local elders will give spiritual and emotional support to the congregation and will arrange as quickly as possible to resume congregation meetings. After a thorough evaluation has been made, an elder should contact the circuit overseer on behalf of the body'of elders to apprise him of any injuries, damage to the Kingdom Hall, or damage to the homes of the brothers, as well as of any special needs. The circuit overseer will then telephone the branch office with a report of the situation. The branch office will coordinate any large-scale relief measures that are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If a Disaster Strlkas Elsewhere: </span><span class="font15">Remember the brothers and sisters in your prayers. (2 Cor. 1:8-11) If you wish to provide monetary assistance, you may send your donations to the Society, where a relief fund Is set aside for this purpose. The address is: Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483. (Acts 2:44, 45; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 9:5-7; see the December 1, 1985, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font15"> pages 20-2.) Do not send materials or supplies to the disaster area unless specifically requested by the brothers in charge. This will assure an orderly relief effort and the proper distribution of goods. (1 Cor. 14:40) Please do not telephone the Society unnecessarily, as this can tie up phone lines that are needed to handle Incoming calls from the disaster area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After a proper assessment has been made, the Society will determine if a relief committee should be formed. Responsible brothers will be notified. All should cooperate with the elders taking the lead so that the critical needs of all the brothers are adequately met.—See </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom,</span><span class="font15"> pages 310-15.</span></p>

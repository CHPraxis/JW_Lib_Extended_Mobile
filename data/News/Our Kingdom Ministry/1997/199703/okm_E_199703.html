</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Without question, in every culture around the world, family life is disintegrating. Satan’s world wallows in deceit and immorality. (1 John 5:19) This underscores the urgency for us to ‘build up our household' and to teach others how they can do the same for theirs.—Prov. 24:3, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Bible Principle* Are a Safeguard: </span><span class="font14">The secret of true family happiness is found in the application of Bible principles. These powerful truths benefit every member of the household in all aspects of life. The family that applies them will be happy and will enjoy godly peace.—Compare Isaiah 32:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The principles that can help us build up our household are outlined in compact form in the new book, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font14"> Each chapter concludes with a helpful teaching box that emphasizes principles that family members need to remember. Most of these boxes begin with the question, “How can these Bible principles help . .. ?” This draws attention to God’s thoughts so that we get his thinking on the subject under discussion.—Isa. 48:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">* Become familiar with the book. Learn to locate the principles that can be of assistance when various problems arise. The book discusses such matters as these: what one should look for when considering a prospective marriage mate (chapter 2), what vital keys unlock the door to lasting marital happiness (chapter 3), how parents can raise their teenagers to be responsible, God-fearing adults (chapter 6), how to protect the family from destructive Influences (chapter 8), principles to help single-parent families succeed (chapter 9), spiritual help for families troubled by alcoholism and violence (chapter 12), what to do when marriage ties are at the breaking point (chapter 13), what can be done to honor elderly parents (chapter 15), and how to secure a lasting future for one’s family (chapter 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Mak* Full Us* of th* N*w Book: </span><span class="font14">If you have not already done so, why not study the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book together as a family? Also, whenever your family is confronted with new problems or challenges, review the chapters in the book that deal with these, and prayerfully consider how to apply the counsel. Additionally, during March, be generous in scheduling time for the field ministry so that you can endeavor to place </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> in the hands of as many people as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Families that practice godly devotion will be spiritually strengthened and united and will be well prepared to cope with the attacks of Satan. (1 Tim. 4:7, 8; 1 Pet. 5:8, 9) How thankful we are that we have divine instruction from the Originator of the family!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Show Yourselves Thankful”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Most of us were trained in childhood to say “please” and “thank you” when someone showed us courtesy or kindness. Paul admonishes us always to ‘show ourselves thankful,’ and we should especially be grateful to Jehovah. (Col. 3:15, 16) But how can we express thankfulness to our Grand Creator? And what special reasons do we have to be thankful to him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul wrote: “Thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; (1 Cor. 15:57) At Memorial time each year, we are reminded of the boundless love both God and Christ showed in providing the ransom that gives us the hope of eternal life. (John 3: 16) Since almost all of us have lost loved ones in death, how thankful we are for Jesus’ promise of the resurrection! Our hearts overflow with gratitude when we contemplate the prospect of surviving the end of this system without ever dying at all. (John 11:25, 26) It is difficult to find words to express thanks for all the marvelous blessings we will yet experience at Jehovah's hand in the coming earthly Paradise. (Rev. 21:4) What better reasons could anyone have to ‘show himself thankful’ to God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Expr**&gt; Thank* to God: </span><span class="font14">It is always appropriate to express our thanks in prayer to Jehovah for his goodness. (Ps. 136:1-3) We are moved, also, to demonstrate our thanks to him in other positive ways. For example, we will certainly be in attendance on Sunday. March 23, for the Memorial of Christ’s death. To help meet the material needs of the local congregation and of the worldwide work, we gladly ‘honor Jehovah with our valuable things.’ (Prov. 3:9) We fully support the elders and cooperate with them, thus showing our gratitude to Jehovah for the help he provides through them. (1 Thess. 5: 12, 13) Every day, we strive to maintain upright conduct that glorifies God’s name. (1 Pet. 2:12) Jehovah Is pleased with all these evidences of our gratitude.—1 Thess. 5:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">'Our Finest Expr**aion of Thank*: </span><span class="font14">Having a whole-souled share in the Kingdom-preaching work, honoring Jehovah’s name, expressing gratitude in prayer, and loyally defending the truth are among the finest expressions of heartfelt thanks that we can make to our Creator for all that he has done in our behalf. Jehovah delights to see us render him acts of sacred service in support of his will “that all sorts of men should be saved.&quot; (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) That is why so many publishers who can arrange for it are answering the call that appeared in February’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> to enroll as auxiliary pioneers during one or more of the months of March, April, and May. Putting forth an extra effort in the ministry is a fine way to ‘show ourselves thankful’ to God. Will you be able to join the ranks of the pioneers in April? in May?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We have been given a sure hope of living forever. When we see it come to pass, we will have further bountiful reasons every day to continue giving joyful thanks to Jehovah.—Ps. 79:13.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Make Return Visits Without Delay: </span><span class="font15">How long should you wait before making a return visit? Some publishers call back within a day or two of the initial contact. Others return later on the same day! Is that too soon? Generally, householders do not seem to mind. Often it is the publisher making the call who needs to cultivate a more positive attitude along with a little boldness. Consider the following experiences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>22</sup> A 13-year-old publisher was working from house to house one day when he saw two women walking together. Mindful of the encouragement to preach to people wherever we find them, he approached the women on the street. They showed interest in the Kingdom message, and each accepted a </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font15">book. The young brother obtained their addresses, returned two days later, and started a Bible study with each of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>23</sup> One sister makes arrangements to call back the following week. But a day or two after the original call, she stops by to give the householder a magazine on the subject they discussed previously. She tells the householder: “I saw this article and thought you would like to read it. I can’t stop to talk now, but I’ll be back on Wednesday afternoon as planned. Is that time still all right with you?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>24</sup> When an individual shows interest in the truth, we can be sure that he will encounter opposition in one form or another. Our calling back soon after the initial contact is made will strengthen him to withstand any pressures he faces from relatives, close friends, and others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Cultivate Interest of Those Found in Public Places: </span><span class="font15">Many of us enjoy preaching on the streets, in parking lots, on public transportation, in shopping centers, in parks, and so forth. In addition to placing literature, we need to cultivate interest. To that end, an effort should be made to obtain the name, the address and, if possible, the telephone number of every interested person we meet. It is not as difficult as you might think to obtain this information. As the conversation is coming to a close, take out your notebook and ask: “Is there any way we can continue this conversation at another time?” Or say: “I would like you to read an article that I am sure will interest you. May I bring it to your home or office?” One brother simply asks: “At what number can you be reached?” He reports that in three months all but three persons were happy to give him their phone number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> Use the Telephone to Find and Develop Interest: </span><span class="font15">A pioneer sister uses the telephone to reach people living in high-security buildings. She also makes return visits in the same way. On the initial call, she says: “I know you don’t know me. I am making a special effort to contact people in your area to share a thought from the Bible. If you have a moment, I would like to read the promise found at...” After reading the scripture, she says: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could see that time come? I have enjoyed reading this to you. If you have enjoyed it too, I would like to call again and discuss another scripture.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>27</sup> On the return phone call, she reminds the householder of their previous conversation and says she would like to read from the Bible what conditions will be like when wickedness is done away with. Then she has a brief Bible discussion with the householder. Over the course of many telephone conversations, 35 people have invited her to their home and seven home Bible studies have been started! Is it sometimes difficult for you to make return visits on interested persons during the cold winter months because of impassable roads, icy conditions, or sickness? If so, why not keep in touch with them by telephone?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> Follow Up Interest Found in Business Places: </span><span class="font15">Much more is involved in working from store to store than simply offering magazines. Many shopkeepers have a sincere interest in the truth, and that interest must be cultivated. In some cases, it may be possible to have a Bible discussion or even a study right on the premises. In other cases, you and the interested person may be able to meet during the noon break or at some other convenient time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>29</sup> A traveling overseer called on the owner of a small grocery store and offered to demonstrate a Bible study. When asked how long the demonstration would take, the traveling overseer said it would take just 15 minutes. With that, the storekeeper hung a sign on the door: “Back in 20 Minutes,” pulled up a couple of chairs, and the two of them discussed the first five paragraphs of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font15"> book. This sincere man was so impressed by what he learned that he attended the Public Meeting and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> Study that Sunday and agreed to continue the study the following week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>30</sup> To off or a study in a business place, you might say this:</span><span class="font15"> “Our Bible study program takes just 15 minutes to demonstrate. If it is convenient, I will be glad to show you how it is done.&quot; Then, stick to the time limit. If it is not possible to have a long discussion in a place of business, it may be more appropriate to call on the shopkeeper at his home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> Call Back Evan When No Literature Has Been Placed: </span><span class="font15">Every spark of interest deserves a return visit, whether literature has been placed or not. Of course, if it becomes clear that the householder really is not interested in the Kingdom message, it is best to direct your efforts elsewhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>32</sup> In the door-to-door work, a sister met a lady who was very friendly but who firmly refused the offer of the magazines. The publisher writes: “For days I thought about her and decided I wanted to talk to her again.” Finally, the sister prayed, took courage, and knocked at the lady’s door. To her delight the householder invited her inside. A Bible study was started, and it was conducted again the following day. In time, the householder came into the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>33</sup> Plan Ahead to Get the Most Accomplished: </span><span class="font15">It is recommended that some time be spent each week in making return visits. Much can be accomplished with good planning. Line up calls in the same area where you will be working from house to house. When working from an automobile, the group should be kept small so that each one will have a full opportunity to make return visits. The driver should know in advance where the return visits will be made so that unnecessary driving can be avoided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>34</sup> Those who are successful in making return visits and in starting home Bible studies say that it is essential to show a sincere personal interest in people and to keep thinking about them even after the call is made. It is also necessary to have an appealing Bible subject to discuss and to lay the groundwork for the return visit before leaving the initial call. Further, it is Important to return promptly to follow up the interest. The objective of starting a Bible study must always be kept well in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>35</sup> A vital quality for success in the return visit work is boldness. How is it acquired? The apostle Paul answers by saying that we ‘muster up boldness’ to declare the good news to others “by means of our God.” If you need to grow in this area, pray to Jehovah for help. Then, in harmony with your prayers, follow up all interest. Jehovah will surely bless your efforts!</span></p></li></ul>

Along with the usual district conventions, a number of international conventions will be held in North America as well as in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean area, and the South Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Several of these special conventions will be held in North America, and delegates from around the world will be Invited. Also, we can anticipate having missionaries at these international conventions. Missionaries and others in foreign special service who qualify will be invited to attend one of these conventions in or near their home country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Additional information regarding dates, locations, delegate qualifications, arrangements for foreign delegates, and other details will be forthcoming. There will be opportunity for a limited number of delegates from the United States to attend international conventions in other countries. Those publishers having in mind filling out applications for delegate selection may wish to start saving some of their funds in anticipation of these special events.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">■ When the congregation is called upon to assist in arranging for a funeral, the following questions may arise:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Who should give the funeral discourse? </span><span class="font14">This is a decision to be made by family members. They may select any baptized brother in good standing. If the body of elders are asked to provide a speaker, they will usually select a capable elder to give a talk based on the Society’s outline. Although not eulogizing the deceased, it may be appropriate to call attention to exemplary qualities he or she displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May tho Kingdom Hall bo used? </span><span class="font14">It can if permission has been granted by the body of elders and if it does not Interfere with a regularly scheduled meeting. The hall may be used if the deceased had a clean reputation and was a member of the congregation or the minor child of a member. If the Individual had caused public notoriety by unchristian conduct, or If other factors exist that might reflect unfavorably on the congregation, the elders may decide not to allow the use of the hall.—See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font14"> book, pages 62-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Ordinarily, Kingdom Halls are not used for funerals of unbelievers. An exception might be made if surviving family members are actively associated as baptized publishers, the deceased was known by a fair number in the congregation to have had a favorable attitude toward the truth and a good reputation for upright conduct in the community, and no worldly customs are incorporated into the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When granting use of the Kingdom Hall, the elders will consider whether it is customarily expected gregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The special public talk for the Memorial season this year will be presented in most congregations on Sunday, April 6. The talk is entitled “Keep Clean From Worldly Defilements.&quot; All of us should attend, and we should assist interested ones who came to the Memorial to be present for the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ In order to get the most out of congregation studies in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font14"> book, to see the casket present at the funeral. If it is, they might permit it to be brought into the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What about funarala for worldly people? </span><span class="font14">If the deceased had a good reputation In the community, a brother might give a comforting Bible talk at the funeral home or graveside. The congregation will decline to handle a funeral for one who was known for immoral, unlawful conduct or whose life-style grossly conflicted with Bible principles. A brother certainly would not share with a clergyman in conducting an interfaith service nor In any funeral conducted in a church of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What if tha dacaasad waa dia-fallowshippad? </span><span class="font14">The congregation would generally not be Involved. The Kingdom Hall would not be used. If the person had been giving evidence of repentance and manifesting a desire to be reinstated, a brother’s conscience might allow him to give a Bible talk at the funeral home or graveside, to give a witness to unbelievers and to comfort the relatives. Before making this decision, however, it would be wise for the brother to consult with the body of elders and give consideration to what they may recommend. In situations where it would not be wise for that brother to be involved, it may be appropriate for a brother </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">who is a member of the deceased person’s family</span><span class="font14"> to give a talk to console the relatives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">■ Ever since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established in 1983, the brothers have contributed generously, thus enabling loans to be made for Kingdom Hall construction. Already some 2,700 congregations in this country have benefited from this arrangement. Many congregations could not otherwise build new Kingdom Halls or renovate those in need of repair. There is now an urgent need to use some of these contributed funds to provide loans to congregations in economically depressed countries. Your continued support of this arrangement is greatly appreciated by the Society and by those congregations that benefit from your contributions.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Memorial Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Memorial observance falls on Sunday, March 23. The elders should give attention to the following matters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location for the observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.—See the February 15, 1985, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> page 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Plates, glasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The Kingdom Hall or other place of meeting should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Attendants and servers should be selected and Instructed in advance about the proper procedure and their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ When more than one celebration is scheduled in the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination among, congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby, entryway, public sidewalks, and parking lot.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Helping Families to Secure a Lasting Future</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Greed is healthy,” a financier told a college graduating class, adding: “You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” That is typical of how the world promotes self-interest as the way to ensure one’s future. In sharp contrast, Jesus taught that a Christian must “disown himself... for what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?” (Matt. 16:24-26) To secure a lasting future, a person must center his whole life on doing the will of God —the most important goal for families today. (Ps. 143: 10; 1 Tim. 4:8) That message is conveyed in the concluding chapter of the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font14"> This new publication helps people see what really matters in life and how they can act beneficially toward their families. As we continue to preach the good news everywhere, what can we say that will encourage those we meet to read the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness </span><span class="font14">book? Here are some suggestions:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Both at the door and on the street, you might try using the tract “Enjoy Family Life” to start conversations. You could ask: </span><span class="font14">■ “With all the anxieties that modern living brings upon us, do you feel that it is possible to have a really happy family life? (Allow for response.] This tract assures us that it is possible. Would you like to read it?” If it is accepted, you could continue by saying: “Since you are interested in this subject, you may also enjoy this book that provides detailed advice on how to find happiness in the family circle.” Show the table of contents in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book. Point out a few eye-catching chapter titles. Turn to page 10, and read from the last sentence of paragraph 17 to the end of paragraph 18. Offer the book, and mention the donation arrangement. Explain that you have more to share, and ask when you could get in touch again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You could follow up your initial conversation about happy family life by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “I would like to point out something in the book you obtained that I think you will appreciate. The last chapter focuses on the real secret of family happiness. [Read paragraph 2 on page 183.] Note that working together to do God’s will is the key. We recommend that families study the Bible together to learn what God’s will is and how to apply it in the household. We offer a free Bible study course that takes only a few months to complete. If you will allow me, I’ll show you how it’s conducted. ” Return with the brochure </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font14"> or the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font14">book, whichever would be more appropriate.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When talking to classmates at school or to youths in the territory, you might get a response to this question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “How important is it for parents and their children to keep open the lines of communication with one another? [Allow for response.] Notice what this handbook on family life says about the subject of ‘Honest and Open Communication.’ [Read all of paragraph 4 and the first sentence of paragraph 5 on page 65 in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book.] The paragraphs that follow provide practical suggestions on how to improve communication within a family. This book is entitled </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font14"> If you would like to read it and promise to do so, you may have this copy to keep.&quot; Explain that you will follow up later to get his comments on what he reads.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You could build on your initial conversation with a youth about parent-child communication by saying this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “I appreciated the interest you showed in the importance of having good communication within your family. What would you say is the most important subject that parents and children should discuss?” Allow for response. Then turn to page 68 In the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book, and read the answer that is found in the first half of paragraph 11. “Havingaweek-ly Bible study Is an excellent way to acquire knowledge of God.” Present the brochure </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font14"> Explain that its 16 lessons provide a basic outline of the Bible’s message. Read the Introduction on page 2, and then discuss together the first lesson.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If you meet a parent in the house-to-house work, or perhaps at a park or a playground, you might arouse interest by saying: </span><span class="font14">■ “I’m sure you’ll agree that rearing children today is a real challenge. What do you think can protect your family from unwholesome influences? [Allow for response.] Here is some sound advice that I have appreciated.” Relate the Illustration in paragraph 1, and read paragraph 2 on page 90 in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness </span><span class="font14">book. Explain how It gives balanced direction that really works to protect families from destructive influences. Offer to leave a copy, and make yourself available to answer any questions that arise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> On </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">your second visit with a parent who accepted the “Family Happiness” book, you could continue the conversation in this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “When we first met, I could see that you genuinely care about your children and that you want to do all you can to protect them from wrong influences. You may not have read it yet, but there is a very important observation made in the book I left with you that you should see. [Read paragraph 19 on page 59.] Developing a relationship with God requires our getting to know him through the pages of his written Word, the Bible. Would you like to have me demonstrate how we study the Bible as a family?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">’Worldly advisers cannot show families the way to happiness but will surely leave them disappointed. Let us give the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book wide distribution so that people everywhere can be helped by God’s Word to secure a lasting future.—1 Tim. 6:19.</span></p>

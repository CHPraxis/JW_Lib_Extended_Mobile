</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Brochures are powerful instruments. In just 32 pages, a brochure can firmly establish Scriptural truths and overturn reasonings and teachings contrary to the knowledge of God.—2 Cor. 10:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> After reading the brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide,</span><span class="font9"> a man was moved to write: &quot;I have never seen such organization. ... It is marvelous to find people who take God’s will so seriously in this age of so much religious hypocrisy.” A witch doctor in Africa studied the brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! </span><span class="font9">What effect did it have on him? He gave up his witch doctor practice and dismissed the women he lived with except his senior wife. Then he legally married her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Should You Believe in the Trinity?</span><span class="font9"> js a well-documented, reasonable. and effective instrument of truth. Commenting on it. a religion writer for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Gleaner'in</span><span class="font9"> Jamaica, West Indies, said: “The publication... is a masterstroke of the Witnesses and now no Trinitarian—or binatarlan—is safe. The booklet piles quotation upon quotation from historical and theological sources to show that the Trinity doctrine was not derived from the Bible. ... It is most difficult for this religion writer to see how the average—or even above average church member—can answer the compelling and commanding arguments marshaled by the Witnesses against the view that Jesus is God.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">J</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Use Them Well: To be effective, these attractive and authoritative instruments must be placed with people who will read them. Since we have various brochures, each dealing with a different theme, we should endeavor to offer the one that we judge most appropriate for the individual we are witnessing to. Knowing our brochures and having a variety of them at hand will make it easier for us to use them well, whether in field service, at home, or elsewhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> For example, if speaking to someone who is confused about Christendom's Trinity doctrine or who may think that Jesus is God, which brochure would you use? If someone questions why a loving God would permit so much suffering, which brochure would meet the need? If a person expresses concern about the need for a government that benefits people, what might be the right brochure for him?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">* In addition to knowing which brochure to use, endeavor to whet the appetite of the person about its contents. If circumstances permit, point out a comment or illustration that might stimulate his Interest in reading the material. Or you could read a paragraph or two with him, look up cited texts, and discuss the material. Many fine Bible studies have been started this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>Our brochures provide Scriptural answers and instill hope in those who sigh and groan over the detestable things being done in the world. (Compare Ezekiel 9:4.) People who are sheeplike will respond to the message such literature contains. It is our privilege to make good use of the brochures in all features of our ministry as we search out interested ones.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Good Use of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower and Awake!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> are the most valuable and the most beneficial magazines that people can read today. Why? Because the spiritual truths they contain can have an everlasting effect for good on people’s lives. However, many are not fully conscious of their spiritual need, or they do not know where to look to satisfy it. It is our privilege to imitate the apostle Paul by helping people to open their eyes spiritually.—Matt. 5:3; Acts 26:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Be Positive and Prepare Well: Likely there are sheeplike people in your territory who will respond to the truth. Some may simply need kind encouragement to read the magazines. Therefore, be positive and persuasive as you offer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> Keep a supply of magazines at hand and take advantage of every opportunity to distribute them, even when featuring other publications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> What may make us more effective in distributing magazines? To begin with, we must really appreciate their value ourselves. We should be familiar with the articles in the magazines that we are offering, and this will enhance our confidence and our eagerness to present them. Keep this thought in mind as you initially read them. Be alert to select points to highlight in the ministry. Ask yourself: ‘To whom would this article particularly appeal? Would a housewife, a young person, or perhaps a businessman appreciate it? Would this point be intriguing to a student, to a married person, to someone concerned about the environment?’ To be truly effective, we should be able to recommend the magazines based on our personal knowledge and enjoyment of their timely articles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Make Good Use of Older Issues: Remember, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> do not lose their value, even if they have not all been placed within a month or two of their issue date. The Information they contain does not become less important with the passage of time, and we should not hesitate to offer older copies if they are in good condition. Allowing older magazines to accumulate and never using them shows a lack of appreciation for these valuable instruments. Each magazine contains truths that have the potential to awaken and satisfy spiritual appetites. Instead of setting aside older issues and forgetting about them, would it not be better to make a special effort to place them in the hands of interested people or at least to leave them in an inconspicuous place when people are not at home?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine has helped many who initially were not spiritually inclined persons to become conscious of their spiritual need. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is a key instrument in the spiritual feeding</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">' In obedience to Jesus' words at Matthew 6:33, true Christians have always kept the Kingdom first in their lives. Hence, “Keep Seeking First the Kingdom&quot; is an appropriate theme for the circuit assembly program that will begin in September 1993.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> From the outset the program will highlight the reality of the Kingdom, emphasizing that it is a functioning government with a domain, rulers, subjects, and laws. In fact, many of the laws of human governments that benefit society today are based on Bible laws.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The protection and blessings we receive from giving the Kingdom priority in all aspects of our lives will be considered. Helpful counsel will be given to show how we can avoid needless anxiety. Talks, demonstrations, and discussions will show why it is so important to keep our eye simple.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’On Saturday of the assembly, qualified baptismal candidates will be able to make public declaration of their dedication to Jehovah. And on Sunday, all of us will want to be present for the public talk, entitled “What God's Kingdom Will Do for Mankind.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Be sure to make your plans to be present for both days of the circuit assembly. The assembly program, coupled with pleasant brotherly association, will provide uplifting and refreshing encouragement that none of us will want to miss.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> 'Do what?’ you ask. Proverbs 3:27 answers: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">do it.&quot;</span><span class="font9"> Is it “in the power of your hand” to expand your activities and share in the auxiliary or the regular pioneer service? Can you do that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How encouraging it was to read in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1993 Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> that there was an average of 106,031 regular and auxiliary pioneers in the United States, a ratio of 1 pioneer to 8 publishers. Yes, 5,093 entered the pioneer service last year. This amounts to almost 14 publishers a day who examined their circumstances and discovered they could do more in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Auxiliary pioneering is an avenue of doing good to others. Last year there was a peak of 105,748 auxiliary pioneers. That is excellent. Many publishers are seeking ways to auxiliary pioneer more often throughout the year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">* To determine whether you can “do it” or not, you first need to consider your heartfelt desire. (Matt. 22:37-39) Acts 20:35 says: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.&quot; Undoubtedly, those who give spiritual assistance generously from the heart have the right desire. To be a successful publisher or pioneer, that desire is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Second, consider your present circumstances. Can you make acljustments in your daily affairs to serve full-time? Not everyone can. But after prayerful selfexamination, every year thousands find a way to “do it.&quot; (Col. 4:5; w77 p. 701) For example, some families select particular months for some or all members of the family to auxiliary pioneer. Other families sponsor one of their members as a regular pioneer. Has your family given consideration to these possibilities?—See Proverbs 11:25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font9"> explains logically that a new world free from suffering is near. How might we introduce it? Suggestions ran be found in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book under the main heading “Suffering,&quot; starting on page 393, or you may prefer the introduction on page 12 under the heading “Injustice/Suffering.&quot;</span></p></li>

If the brochure is refused, why not offer a tract such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Is it possible for humans to establish a government that will really bring lasting happiness?&quot; Allow for reply, then ask: “What does the record of human history show?&quot; Turn to Jeremiah 10:23, or turn to page 152 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book and read appropriate texts and comments.

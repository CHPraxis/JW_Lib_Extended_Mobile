<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">June 1993 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 36, No. 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others Learn About the Greatest Man</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many who have read the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font9"> have expressed sincere appreciation for the effect that it has had on their lives. One wrote: “When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if I had been invited by Jesus to associate with him, to live by his side, to share his sufferings, his emotions, every aspect of his ministry.... Reading the book is like watching a film about Jesus’ life.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book helps us to get better acquainted not only with Jesus but also with Jehovah. (John 14:9) One 12-year-old said concerning the book: “It comforted me so much that I prayed to Jehovah with tears of joy as soon as I read it Deep down inside, I was reassured to know that Jehovah and Jesus are watching over us.” Jesus said, as recorded at John 17:3, that it means everlasting life for us to know Jehovah and his Son. Studying this book about Jesus’ life gives us special insight into Jehovah’s personality because Jesus is “the exact representation of his very being.”—Heb. 1:3.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Tracts Are So Valuable in Our Ministry Today</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Over 19 million copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book have been printed in over 70 languages. This shows how well the book is being received. Many read the entire book as soon as they receive it. One interested man read it through within two weeks of obtaining it. A clergyman who accepted the book stated: “I cannot put the book down. My wife and I read some of it every night before we go to bed.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Informal Witnessing: One brother showed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book to people at his place of employment. Word got around that he had this book, and reports circulated about what It contained. His coworkers got up a list of those who wanted a copy. He placed 461 books! Five of those who received it are studying. A sister, while traveling on an airplane, placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book with a priest who was going to attend the ordination of a new cardinal. The priest had been in the Vatican for 40 years. All of us should take full advantage of opportunities to recommend the book to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers who were witnessing on a street that led to a cemetery saw people whitewashing graves. The publishers used the opportunity to offer them tracts. The next day was a holiday on which many people visit the cemetery, so the publishers decided to stand at the entrance of the cemetery and offer tracts. Over five hundred tracts were placed, with only three persons refusing them. The next year, publishers returned and distributed more than a thousand tracts, with only six refusals. A number of individuals expressed deep appreciation. One man read the tract as he was leaving, and shortly he returned to speak with the sister who had given it to him. He said: “There is someone I would like to have read this message. May I have another one?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Tracts are a handy size and easy to carry with us wherever we go. When having informal conversations with others, whether strangers or acquaintances, we should strive to make a brief statement that could lead into discuss</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Youths Appreciate It: Youngsters are showing much interest in the book. One nine-year-old wrote: “My favorite publication is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font9"> because I learn a lot from it.” When we meet young people in the field service, we should take the time, if their parents are agreeable, to show these young ones the book and review some of its highlights and artwork. We may be able to place books with these youngsters. When given the opportunity to know about Jesus, young people today can relate to him. Jesus was an approachable person.—Matt. 19:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Reading the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book can change people’s lives. Try to acquaint as many as you can with its contents. Use the material on the last page of the introduction to the book, under the subheading “Benefit by Learning About Him.” This material will help people focus on what they can gain from reading the book. Many in your territory may exclaim as one person did after reading the book: “It is the best book I have ever read! It changed my life.&quot; ing one of the eight tracts that we now have available. This could be done while talking with neighbors, while shopping or waiting for an appointment, while visiting relatives, or in many other situations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Why Effective: The tracts are appealingly colorful. They are brief. Householders and those we meet in informal situations are not overwhelmed, feeling obligated to do extensive reading. Yet, the message is absorbing and informative. The reader gets a solid Scriptural view of the issue addressed in the tract. After receiving the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font9"> and having it reviewed with him, one young man exclaimed: “Never have I heard such encouraging information about the world’s situation.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark2">1</a></sup><sup></sup>”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> We want to use these tracts on every appropriate occasion. Many publishers have found them helpful in getting conversations started in house-to-house work. Numerous studies now being conducted were started with a tract. On page 4 of this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> there are some practical suggestions on how to use tracts effectively. Yes, tracts are small but valuable tools for our ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meetings for June</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">NOTE: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Divine Teaching” District Convention and then for a 30-mlnute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

After introducing tract, publisher discerns little interest on part of householder and so decides to offer two magazines instead of book. The second demonstration should use the same presentation in paragraph 2, but this time householder shows interest. Publisher proceeds to present book after brief discussion of information in tract, and he also makes brief explanation of donation arrange-</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">■ What would be considered proper attire when presenting oneself for baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While standards of dress vary in different parts of the world, the Bible’s admonition to dress “with modesty and soundness of mind” remains the same for all Christians, regardless of where they live. (1 Tim. 2:9) This principle should be applied when considering what is proper attire for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The June 1, 1985, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font9">page 30. gives this counsel for a person who is getting baptized: “Certainly modesty should prevail in the type of bathing suit used. This is Important today when fashion designers seem to want to flaunt sexuality and achieve almost total nudity. Another factor to take into account is that some suits that appear modest when dry are less than that when wet. No one getting baptized would want to be a cause for distraction or stumbling at an event as serious as baptism.—Philippians 1:10.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In harmony with this advice, those being baptized will want to wear modest clothing, keeping in mind the importance of the occasion. Thus, a swimsuit that is skimpy or one that immodestly clings to the body when wet would be unbecoming attire for a Christian and should be avoided. Likewise, it would be inappropriate for one to be unkempt or slovenly in appearance. Further, it would not be fitting to wear T-shirts with worldly sayings or commercial slogans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the assigned elders review the questions for baptism with the baptismal candidate, this would be a good time to discuss the importance of wearing proper attire. In this way the dignity of the occasion will be maintained, and we will continue to stand out as different from the world.—Compare John 15:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many of us will be away from our home congregations for a time during vacation months this summer, such as while attending district conventions. If we will be away at the end of a month, we will want to make sure that we send our field service reports to the congregation secretary. This should be done early enough to be included with the congregation’s monthly report, which the secretary compiles and sends to the Society by the sixth of the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We also want to be alert to opportunities for informal witnessing. Such opportunities may arise while traveling, visiting with relatives, or talking with others we meet. Do we view occasions to give a witness as Jesus did? He did not hold back from giving an informal witness. (John 4:5-30) The apostle Paul likewise ‘bought out the opportune time’ and enjoyed fine results. (Eph. 5:16; Acts 17:17; 28: 30,31; Col. 4:5) Make definite plans to engage in informal witnessing. Be well prepared with a few timely talking points and have a magazine or a tract at hand to stimulate interest.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> By carefully following through on these reminders, we will be sure to use our time wisely this summer and will be giving Jehovah our “firstfruits.”—Prov. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">Albania: From December 1991 to December 1992, the number of publishers increased from 24 to 107. The number of Bible studies went up from 4 to 221 during the same period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Central African Republic: On January 20,1993, the government published a decree permitting the resumption of full activities by Jehovah’s Witnesses. The brothers there rejoice in now being able to use their Kingdom Halls and in being able to hold the “Light Bearers” District Convehtion openly. A total of 4,739 were in attendance at the six conventions held, and 121 were baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Tracts to Introduce the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> During the month of June, many publishers will be using tracts to arouse interest in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font9"> This approach helps them to determine the degree of interest and to decide whether it would be appropriate to offer the book to a particular householder on the initial visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font9"> Tracts are of great assistance in starting conversations. They help to capture the attention of householders because the tracts deal with meaningful subjects that affect them personally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For example, you may say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “In talking with people, we have noticed that many mention their concern over ... [choose a current event in the news]. It seems that world conditions are going from bad to worse. Some even wonder if this world can survive. How do you feel about that? [Allow householder to respond. Most people are optimistic.] I read something encouraging I would like to share with you. It is in this tract. [Hand householder the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font9"> as you hold an identical tract in your hand.] Notice how Jesus prophesied that...” Read from a paragraph on page 4 or 5 that coincides with the current event mentioned in your introduction. If the individual shows genuine interest, you may decide to show the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book. If it seems appropriate, turn to additional information on Jesus’ prophecy highlighted in chapter 111. Before leaving, you may be able to explain briefly the overall nature of our worldwide work and describe how it is supported. Also, be sure to raise a question on a subject for discussion when you return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Life in a Peaceful New World:</span><span class="font9"> What does living in a peaceful new world mean to you? Generally, people think of lovely scenes of majestic rivers and peaceful valleys, with beautiful animals living at peace with one another. Those who are distressed by present world conditions may find the prospect of a peaceful new world most refreshing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Are you prepared to offer something refreshing and pleasant to your neighbors, your workmates, and those you meet from house to house?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Using the tract “Life in a Peaceful New World,” you could say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Do you think it will ever be possible for people to live in peace as shown on the cover of this tract? (Allow householder to respond.] Please look at the last sentence in the first paragraph on page 2. It asks: ‘But is it just a dream, or fantasy, to believe these conditions will ever exist on earth?’ [Then read the next paragraph in the tract.] That quotation about new heavens and a new earth is from the Bible, at 2 Peter 3:13. If it’s convenient for you to get your Bible, we can read Psalm 104:5 to learn more about the earth’s future.&quot; Or you could just read the verse from your Bible. If the individual shows interest, direct the discussion to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book, chapter 133.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Further return visits will need to be made to ‘water’ the seed that has been planted. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) The article below suggests how a study might be started in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book, either on the initial call or on your return visit.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Bible Studies in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Having a home Bible study would be most enjoyable and rewarding for both you and the householder. There is nothing to compare with the joy of sharing Bible knowledge with others.—Prov. 11:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Sign of the Last Days: If you used the suggestion in the above article and initiated your discussion with the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">WiU This World Survive?,</span><span class="font9"> how can you now start a study using chapter 111 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book? Open the book to chapter 111, and read the first three paragraphs. You may then ask the first question at the end of the chapter: “What prompts the apostles’ question, but apparently what else do they have on their minds?” Help the householder reason on the answer, and use the illustration to teach. After reading the fourth paragraph through the sixth, ask the second question: “What part of Jesus’ prophecy is fulfilled in 70 C.E., but what does not occur then?” If the householder appears interested and has time available, continue your discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When it appears that another time may be more suitable for the householder, you might ask: “Would you like to know more about when the end of the system of things will be?” You may then arrange to return to answer the question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Is a Peaceful World Possible? If you used the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font9"> to lead into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book, how can chapter 133 be helpful in starting a Bible study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After reading 2 Peter 3:13, you may read or summarize the second paragraph on page 3 of the tract and then say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Jesus Christ, the Son of God, will be the King of Jehovah’s Kingdom. Notice how the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font9"> describes Jesus and informs us about what he will accomplish in the future.” Then read the entire chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ask the householder the first question at the end of the chapter: “ ‘What will be the happy privilege of Armageddon survivors and their children?’ [Allow for a response. The other questions may be discussed similarly.] Would you like to be a part of the new earth that Jesus will rule over as King? I would like to have the opportunity each week to help you see from the Bible how this can be your experience.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Some individuals may also be interested in a further discussion about Jesus Christ on this visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “An effort has been made in this book to present Jesus’ earthly life as set forth in the four Gospels. Would you like to learn more about Jesus’ life on earth?” If the householder is agreeable, you may wish to discuss the first of Jesus’ miracles, in chapter 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> There are still many honesthearted people who have a love for righteousness and who are looking for solutions to the problems they face. Truly, offering to share the teachings of Jesus Christ by means of a Bible study is a most rewarding endeavor.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup></sup> In the January 1,1991, issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> page 30, there was an experience entitled &quot;He Found a Tract on the Track.” It told of a railroad maintenance supervisor who found one of our tracts wedged under a rail. He read the tract immediately and then told his sonin-law: &quot;Today I have found the truth!” Both men ordered more literature and studied it. Now, over a hundred of their descendants are active in the truth. This shows whatcan result from reading just one tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Making Use of Opportunities: The brothers everywhere are making use of opportunities to place tracts. One Witness youth noted that her schoolteacher was feeling sad because of the death of her mother-in-law. The young sister wrote her teacher a comforting letter and enclosed the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font9"> The teacher wrote a thank-you note and then spoke with our young sister. Now this teacher regularly accepts the magazines from her.</span></p>

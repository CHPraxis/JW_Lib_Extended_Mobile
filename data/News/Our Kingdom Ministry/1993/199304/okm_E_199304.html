<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—Spiritual Food at the Proper Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">^or nearly 114 years, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> has been admonishing its readers to keep alert spiritually. Its companion magazine </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world within our generation. Together, these two publications have been faithful instruments lighting our way through a bedarkened world. (Isa. 60:2) The truth of God’s Word never changes, but our understanding of it becomes clearer as Jehovah uses these and other instruments to give us spiritual “food at the proper time.”—Matt. 24:45; Prov.4:18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Make the Best Use of Magazines: </span><span class="font9">We can demonstrate our gratitude for the spiritual enlightenment we have received by enthusiastically encouraging people to read both </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> Ordinarily, we would not offer a subscription when making an initial visit in the house-to-house work or when witnessing informally. Many peo-pie obtain single copies of the magazines with some regularity and obviously enjoy reading them. These persons may appreciate the opportunity to receive a subscription for six months. However, it is best to offer single issues of the magazines to householders who are not well acquainted with our literature and whose appreciation for its value may be limited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> How can you discern if there is genuine interest? As you feature one or two points in a magazine, a tract, or a brochure, note the householder’s reaction. Does he listen attentively? Does he respect the Bible and follow along with the reading of Bible texts? Does he respond to viewpoint questions? If so, you may arrange for a return visit within a week or even sooner and enjoy a further discussion at that time. If it is clear that the householder is reading the literature you left and appreciates talking about spiritual things, you may ask him if he would appreciate receiving the magazines regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Individual issues of the magazines may be offered to fellow workers, schoolmates, and relatives. The magazines may also be offered to business acquaintances and in street witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The new magazines should be made available to publishers as soon as they are delivered to the congregation. When you receive a new issue, become thoroughly familiar with it. What subjects deeply concern people in your area? World peace and security? The economy? Good government? The environment? Outstandingly, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">directs people to the only permanent solution, God’s Kingdom. (Dan. 2:44; Matt. 6:10) It is truly a priceless gift from our “Grand Instructor.”—-Isa. 30:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> April and May offer excellent opportunities to devote more time to field service. Since May has five full weekends, many will be enrolling as auxiliary pioneers. All of us can set personal goals now to increase our field service during these two months and enthusiastically encourage everyone we meet to read </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help New Ones Make Progress</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> On April 17,1992, nearly 11.5 million people worldwide gathered to celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. This was over two and a half times the total number of publishers associated with congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses. How gratifying it is to see such multitudes flocking “to the mountain of Jehovah”! (Mic. 4:2) At present there are some seven million people who are showing a measure of interest in true worship and who are not yet public praisers of Jehovah. Surely Jesus’ words “the harvest is great” have never been so meaningful!—Matt. 9:37,38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> During the month of April, we will make a special effort to help all those who qualify to have a share in the field ministry. The Congregation Book Study conductor, assisted by other capable publishers and pioneers in his group, will play a key role in this. Our threefold goal is (1) to arrange for a home Bible study with new ones who attend the special public talk and the Memorial this year; (2) to encourage those who are studying to qualify to be unbaptized publishers; and (3) to increase our personal participation in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> A special effort should be made by all to welcome and get acquainted with new ones who attend any of our meetings. What can we do to encourage more of these interested people to have a regular home Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> On an average, 585,441 Bible studies were conducted in the United States each month of the 1992 service year. Publishers may invite their book study conductor to accompany them on Bible studies so as to get acquainted with the students, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font9"> 3/81 p. 4) Some of these Bible students may now be attending meetings and qualify to have a share in the house-to-house work. Are new ones witnessing informally with some regularity? Do they meet the qualifications for becoming unbaptized publishers as set out in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> pages 97-9? If so, explain to them how they might get started in the house-to-house work after becoming approved as unbaptized publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We must not overlook encouraging one another in our Christian association. (Heb. 10:24,25) If any have slowed down in their ministry, book study conductors should make definite arrangements to provide help and encouragement. Sometimes a warm invitation to accompany us in field service is all that is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> To make April an outstanding month of field service activity will take the cooperation of all. The book study conductor’s enthusiastic lead can make the difference as he helps every member of his group to have a full share in the ministry. Additional meetings for service may be arranged. Elderly ones can be given special attention, and young people can be helped in practical ways. Parents should see to it that the entire family shares in the ministry during April. If all of us give our best to Jehovah in this time of the harvest, his rich blessing will be ours.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“To the House of Jehovah Let Us Go”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> David responded with eagerness to the invitation: “To the house of Jehovah let us go.” (Ps. 122:1) Jehovah’s “house,” represented by the temple, was the gathering place for those who had a desire to worship the true God. It was a sanctuary of security and peace. Today, the worldwide Christian congregation is God’s “house,” “a pillar and support of the truth.” (1 Tim. 3:15) All the provisions for salvation are made available through this channel. For that reason, “to it all the nations must stream” if they desire to enjoy the blessings promised under God’s Kingdom rule.—Isa. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> This “house” comprises more than 69,000 congregations in 229 lands. The doors of Kingdom Halls around the world are open, with more than four million zealous workers extending the invitation: “Come!. . . Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:17) Many have heard this message and responded with appreciation. Others have been touched but have not yet come to Jehovah’s house by associating with the Christian congregation. Such have a “spiritual need” that can be satisfied with provisions found only in the congregation. (Matt. 5:3) We live in critical times, with the end of this system rapidly approaching. An indifferent or reluctant attitude can result in perilous delay. It is urgent that people reach out to “draw close to God” by drawing closer to his organization. (Jas. 4:8) How can we help them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Direct Interest to the Organization: </span><span class="font0">From our initial contact with interested persons, we should be directing their attention to the organization. While we may be able personally to locate scriptures and explain fundamental doctrines, we are not the source of such knowledge. Everything we have learned has come from the organization, channeled through the slave class that supplies “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45-47) From the start, new ones need to realize that pure worship involves more than just us or even the local congregation; there is an organized, theocratic, worldwide society operating under Jehovah’s direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> The direction we receive originates with Jehovah, who has promised to guide and teach us. (Ps. 32:8; Isa. 54:13) This instruction is disseminated primarily through our literature. If we can help interested ones develop a high regard for the literature, recognizing it as a source of lifesaving instruction, they will be far more likely to read and apply its message than to discard it quickly. We should always present and use this literature in a way that cultivates respect for it. This teaches new ones to appreciate the organization and to rely upon its provisions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Let interested ones know that there is a central meeting place in the community where instruction is regularly provided. Give them the Kingdom Hall address and the meeting times. Explain the differences between our meetings and the religious gatherings they may have attended in the past. Everyone is welcome; there are no collections or personal solicitations for funds. While appointed ministers conduct the programs, everyone has opportunity to participate by offering comments and sharing in program parts. Families are welcome; children are included in our Bible discussions. Our ministers do not wear special robes or garments. The Kingdom Hall is tastefully decorated and has no candles, statues, or images. Those who attend are primarily residents of the local neighborhood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Direct interest Progressively on Bible Studies: </span><span class="font0">The primary purpose of a Bible study is to teach the truth of God’s Word. It should also build in the student an appreciation for Jehovah’s organization and make him aware of the vital need to become part of it. The great work done by Jesus and his disciples in the first century attracted sincere ones and united them for work under a central governing body. In communities where the response was good, congregations were formed to give regular training and instruction. Those associated were strengthened spiritually, helping them to endure times of tribulation. (Heb. 10:24, 25; 1 Pet. 5:8-10) In our day it is Jehovah’s purpose “to gather all things together again in the Christ.” (Eph. 1:9, 10) As a result, we have a worldwide “association of brothers.”—1 Pet. 2:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> The weekly Bible study should include instruction that will help students appreciate the organization and take advantage of provisions for their salvation. Take a few minutes each week to relate or describe something about the organization and how it functions. You can find helpful talking points in the November 1,1984, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font0"> The brochures </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide </span><span class="font0">discuss major facets of the organization and how they may benefit us. Arranging for Bible students to view the video </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —The Organization Behind the Name</span><span class="font0"> will let them see for themselves what it is accomplishing. Selected reports and experiences from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font0"> can show the success of the work in countries and cultures other than our own. Other publications may also be used. Over a period of time, progressively explain such things as why we go from house to house, the purpose of our meetings, how we finance our work, and the worldwide scope of our activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Getting acquainted with other Witnesses can have a stimulating effect on new ones, broadening their concept of the congregation. To that end, invite other publishers to sit in on the study from time to time. Someone in the congregation with a similar background or similar interests might add a new dimension to your student’s outlook. Perhaps an elder can accompany you just to get acquainted. Arranging for the circuit overseer or his wife to visit the study may prove to be a real blessing. If there are Witnesses who live close by, getting them acquainted with the Bible student may provide additional encouragement for the student to attend congregation meetings.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Encourage New Ones to Come to Meetings : </span><span class="font0">New ones need to realize how important it is to attend the meetings. Try to stimulate their interest. Point out articles that will be covered in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Study. Mention titles of upcoming public talks. Relate highlights of the material to be covered in the Theocratic Ministry School and Congregation Book Study. Express your own feelings about what you learn at these meetings and why you feel the need to attend. If you are able, offer transportation. A phone call before the meeting might provide an additional incentive to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> When a Bible student does come to a meeting, make him feel welcome. Introduce him to others, including the elders. If he is attending the public talk, introduce him to the speaker. Show him around the Kingdom Hall. Explain the purpose of the literature and magazine counters, contribution boxes, library, and yeartext. Let him know that not only is the hall a house of worship but it is also a center from which the preaching work is locally organized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Explain how our meetings are conducted. Show the student the publications we use. Point out that the Bible is our primary textbook. Everyone can participate, including young children. Explain that all the music and lyrics in our songbook were composed by Jehovah’s Witnesses for use in our worship. Call attention to the variety in the backgrounds of those attending. Make positive comments about the spirit of friendliness and hospitality. This kindly, sincere interest may be one of the strongest factors in prompting the student to come again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Why Some May Be Holding Back: </span><span class="font0">Often, in spite of all you do, some are reluctant to move closer to the organization. Do not quickly give up. Try to put yourself in their place. Up to this time, likely they have not really felt the need to attend religious services except on special occasions. Members of the family or close friends may be pressuring them. They may feel intimidated by neighbors who make disparaging remarks. And, of course, they may be subject to a variety of distractions associated with social and recreational pursuits. They may view these as insurmountable barriers; you need to help them to see things in proper perspective and “make sure of the more important things.” —Phil. 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> Give Scriptural reasons to persevere. Stress that all of us urgently need the encouragement and spiritual upbuilding that we receive from our association together. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Jesus made it clear that family opposition is not a valid reason to hold back. (Matt. 10:34-39) Paul urged us not to be ashamed to identify ourselves publicly as Jesus’ disciples. (2 Tim. 1:8, 12-14) Personal pursuits and distractions have to be controlled; otherwise, they become a snare. (Luke 21:34-36) Those who merit Jehovah’s blessing have to be whole-souled, never halfhearted. (Col. 3:23, 24) Instilling appreciation for such Bible principles may open the way for them to progress spiritually.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup>The Doors Are Open: </span><span class="font0">Jehovah’s house of true worship is elevated above all others. The invitation is being sounded in 229 lands around the world: “Come,... let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah,... and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” (Isa. 2:3) A positive response by new ones can save their life. Directing their interest to Jehovah’s organization is one of the best ways we can help them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">When witnessing from house to house or informally, the conversation frequently turns toward a subject covered by one of our attractive brochures.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">■ How should serving as an auxiliary pioneer be viewed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Auxiliary pioneering should be viewed as both a privilege and a serious responsibility. Tens of thousands of publishers each month are appointed to serve as auxiliary pioneers, and some do so continuously. We commend these zealous publishers whose circumstances permit them to spend the required 60 hours in field service each month that they serve as auxiliary pioneers. Elders as well as others should encourage publishers who apply for auxiliary pioneer service to take their appointment seriously and avoid any inclination toward a casual attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As with regular pioneers, those who volunteer as auxiliary pioneers for one or more months should first count the cost. (Luke 14:28) This includes determining ahead of time whether they can reasonably expect to spend the required amount of time in the field ministry without neglecting other Christian responsibilities. A person’s decision to enroll as an auxiliary pioneer should be made after prayerful consideration of his personal circumstances. It should not be prompted by emotions stirred because others are applying. It should be a reasoned-out decision, accompanied by making a written schedule for fulfilling the requirements. It is important to read the application carefully and decide in one’s own heart that he can honestly say yes to what is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, extra exertion is involved. Certain months during the year lend themselves well to becoming “intensely occupied” with preaching the good news. (Acts 18:5) These include the Memorial season of March and April and the months when the circuit overseer visits the congregation. Many publishers gladly discipline themselves to follow a somewhat stringent schedule so as to have an extra share in the preaching work during these periods of special activity, appreciating that rich blessings are often the result. (2 Cor. 9:6) Many publishers make special efforts to pioneer during vacation months and any month during the year that happens to have five full weekends. But in signing up, they appreciate the need to adhere to the principle ‘Let your Yes mean Yes’ by doing their very best to report 60 or more hours each month they serve as auxiliary pioneers. —Matt. 5:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Publishers who may not be able to pioneer can help by making themselves available to work with the auxiliary pioneers, arranging definite appointments with them. It is helpful to stay out in service longer with the pioneers when possible. Pioneers may especially appreciate having the support of other publishers during early morning, late afternoon, or early evening hours. Auxiliary pioneers are glad to be invited to work with others in making return visits and starting home Bible studies. Those who can thus be supportive of the auxiliary pioneers are bound to reap the greater happiness that comes from giving. —Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Diligence on the part of the many auxiliary pioneers is deeply appreciated. Those able to join them can expect rich blessings. (Prov. 10:4) When can you next share in the joys of increased activity as an auxiliary pioneer?</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Tie In the Tracts With Other Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">‘Of all the magazines being published today, only </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> can help sincere readers find the path to everlasting life. As you converse with people during April and May, some will show unmistakable interest in the Kingdom message, and you may draw their attention directly to the latest magazines or one of the Society’s colorful brochures. Others may initially show little interest. In such cases, first you might discuss a point or two in a tract; then if the householder shows further interest, tie in the tract with the magazine or brochure you are featuring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Most people would agree that in today’s world, there are more problems than solutions. Did you know that many of our most serious problems were foretold in the Bible?” Then you may turn to pages 4 and 5 of the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font9"> and discuss some of the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you are featuring the April 1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and the householder shows interest in what you have read from the tract, you can point to the article entitled “Follow the Light of the World” and explain how Jesus Christ will ultimately solve all man’s problems. Then offer to return at a convenient time to discuss the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>i</sup>If the April 8 “Awake!” is being highlighted, you could use the introduction outlined in paragraph 2 of this article and then add:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">□ “Many are skeptical of the ability of religion and politics to solve our problems, but they wonder whether science has the answer.” Then read an appropriate point in the article “Can Science Meet the Challenges of the 21st Century?” It is quite likely that this article will appeal to many young people, especially students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> When featuring the “Look!” brochure, you might use a different approach:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">□ “Many people wonder what happens to us when we die. Some say we go either to heaven or to hell; others are not sure. The Bible’s answer is both surprising and reassuring.” Then you could introduce and discuss portions of the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font9"> Thereafter you could refer to pages 16 and 17 in the brochure if the householder shows interest in the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> When witnessing to Jewish people, use the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A Peaceful New World —Will It Come?,</span><span class="font9"> which features quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. You could ask the householder the two questions presented in the first paragraph of the tract. After he responds, direct his attention to the first paragraph on page 3. This points to the Messiah as the means by which the peaceful new world will come. If the householder shows further interest, use the April 1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> in the way suggested in paragraph 3 of this article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> If you are a new publisher, you will no doubt appreciate a simple approach. Why not obtain a supply of the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font9"> and follow the suggestions outlined above in paragraph 2?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> We are honored to bring the message of salvation to the homes of people. In our search for ‘deserving ones,’ let us make good use of our tracts and tie them in with other literature when interest is found.—Matt. 10:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Simple and Effective Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Do you regularly make return visits, or do you generally find it difficult because of not knowing what to say? There is no need to feel intimidated. Three things will help you to be successful: (1) good preparation; (2) ability to discuss one or two points on a few simple Bible subjects; and (3) willingness to listen to the viewpoint of the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In preparing to make the return visit, consider what subject would be appropriate to discuss with the householder. Is he a student? Many students will have extra time to discuss Bible topics this month as they enjoy a break from their studies. You will likely find some to be open to the Kingdom message. Did you raise a question at the end of your previous visit, or did the householder show interest in a particular subject? Review your notes, and use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book to locate the information you will need to make an effective return visit. When you make the call, be warm and friendly. Greet the householder by name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you placed </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> with the householder, your return visit could be based on one or two simple points you have selected from a magazine. If you placed a tract on the initial call, you may either comment on the tract itself or follow up the placement by referring to an appropriate point in a magazine or a brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you placed “A Peaceful New World—Will It Come?,” simply say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “The last time I called, we spoke about God’s promise of a peaceful new world. As we discussed, better conditions will come by means of God’s Kingdom. What do you think is required for us to be a part of that peaceful new world?” Allow the householder to comment, then share the thought at Psalm 37:9,11, 29.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you placed “What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?,” these brief</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">remarks may get a discussion started:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tn “At the end of our last conversation, I left you a tract entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font9"> The third paragraph raises some interesting questions: ‘Why do people die? Where are the dead? And how can we be sure they can live again?’ The next subheading, entitled ‘Death, and What Happens When We Die,’ answers each question. I happen to have an extra copy of the tract here. Notice what it says in the fourth paragraph.” Then as the householder follows along, read the paragraph, including the two scriptures, and ask the householder for his viewpoint. Listen carefully to what he has to say, and follow through accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> During the course of the discussion, the householder may express a number of viewpoints that are not. accurate. It is not necessary to take issue with everything he says. Rather, stick to the topic being discussed. Any unscriptural ideas he may have can be corrected during future return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> By all means plan to follow up on any interest by making simple and effective return visits during April.</span></p></li></ul>

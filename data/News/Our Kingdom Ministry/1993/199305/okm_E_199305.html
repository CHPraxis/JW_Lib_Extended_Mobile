<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting the Challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of the House-to-House Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>The idea of going from house to house, making calls on strangers, presents a real challenge to many who take up pure worship. But genuine love for Jehovah helps a person meet this challenge, and even those who are very shy by nature have progressed to the point of becoming full-time preachers of the good news.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is clear from the Bible that the early Christians shared the good news of God’s Kingdom by going from house to house. (Acts 5:42; 20:20,21) As Christians in this 20th century, we too share in this work. Our love for God and for our neighbor motivates us to do this work even though we may meet with indifference, annoyance, contempt, or direct opposition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Meeting the Challenge Accomplishes: </span><span class="font10">Each time we call, we endeavor to sow a few seeds of truth, knowing that eventually the cumulative result may be the bearing of Kingdom fruit. (Eccl. 11:6) Individual circumstances change. Something may happen that could cause a householder to think about what one of us said at the door, and he may be more receptive the next time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Our house-to-house ministry gives those who lean toward truth and righteousness the opportunity to learn about Jehovah and his purposes, starting them on the road to everlasting life. Those who are pursuing worldly pleasures are thus lovingly warned that they need to change in order to enjoy Jehovah’s approval. This ministry also makes known Jehovah’s name and brings honor to him, whether the householders listen or not.—Ezek. 3:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Working in the ministry helps us develop the fruits of the spirit, such as unselfish love, joy, peace, and long-suffering. (Gal. 5:22) It helps us to be humble and sympathetic, since it involves doing good for others. Keeping busy in Jehovah’s work serves to protect us from the world.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Help to Meet the Challenge: </span><span class="font10">New ones need to learn how to share in this most exciting work. They often lack confidence and may therefore become discouraged at the mere thought of going from house to house. We can discuss with them common objections and what we might say in response. We can practice using some of the fine suggestions in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book on responding to conversation stoppers. Why not offer to help them prepare for the field ministry? They can also receive much help by regularly attending the meetings for field service and thereafter working with more experienced publishers. Working with a group can be very strengthening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> As we go from house to house, we have the privilege of representing our God, Jehovah. What greater honor could anyone have than actually being God’s fellow worker? (1 Cor. 3:9) If we rely on him, his spirit will help us meet the challenge of the house-to-house ministry.—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths—Skillfully Direct Your Steps</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our Father, Jehovah, takes a personal interest in the spiritual progress of young people. By wisely listening to his loving commands, youths not only make his heart glad but also find refreshment for their souls. (Prov. 27:11; Matt. 11:28-30) They allow Jehovah to provide skillful direction for their steps. —Prov. 16:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Christ Jesus set the example in his youth as one who gained the approval of both God and men. (Luke 2:52) Youths today should strive to do the same. Skillful direction of a young person’s steps should be evident in his pursuit of spiritual things. At the age of 12, Jesus was known for his desire to talk to others about Jehovah. (Luke 2:46, 47) Young people today have shown a similar desire to explain their faith to others. —w90 7/1 pp. 29-30; U'8712/1 p. 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What can you young ones do right now and especially during the coming summer months to “honor Jehovah with your valuable things”? (Prov. 3:9) Why not increase the time you usually spend in the work of preaching and teaching the good news, even perhaps as an auxiliary pioneer? You might be surprised by the increased joy and other benefits that naturally flow from an increased share in the ministry. This will also give you the opportunity to work in the field service with a greater number of different publishers. You may be able to start right now by inviting an experienced publisher or two to work with you this weekend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Parents can give tremendous encouragement and assistance to their children through the use of practice sessions in addition to accompanying them in the ministry. Other mature ones in the congregation can take the initiative by asking young ones to accompany them in the door-to-door ministry and in the return-visit and Biblestudy work. Close association with such spiritually strong publishers will build up the young ones and help them to “press on to maturity.”—Heb. 6:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Every Christian has the need to improve his teaching ability. Youths are no exception. Do you young ones prepare thoroughly for assignments you may be privileged to give in the Theocratic Ministry School? Do you have a regular schedule for reading and personal study as well as for meditation? Do you readily make personal application of the material you consider? Do you prepare well for the meetings so that you will fully understand the material and be ready to offer comments? Do you take note of helpful points expressed during meetings and try to use the suggestions set out in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Do not pass up opportunities to share in cleaning the Kingdom Hall and to assist older or infirm brothers and sisters with chores or in other practical ways. Do not neglect to make your own regular contributions to help care for Kingdom Hall expenses and the Society’s worldwide work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If we ‘keep on guard according to Jehovah’s word’ and allow him to direct our steps, he will lead us to happiness and increased privileges of service.—Ps. 119:9.</span></p>

After brief introduction, introduce three demonstrations based on paragraphs 2-5. After each demonstration, ask audience how presentation could be adapted to various circumstances in local territory. Conclude with encouragement to share fully in ministry this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">The Importance of Family Spirituality. Talk by elder. Discuss need for family consideration of daily text, outlining how this might be done under varying circumstances and family schedules. Also emphasize need for family prayer at least once a day. This might be done at bedtime. Same principles would apply in divided households, single-parent families, and families with no children. Family preparation also plays a part in getting the most from congregation meetings each week and being able to strengthen faith of others as well.—Heb. 10:23-25.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “Instruct me, O Jehovah.” (Ps. 86:11) This should be the earnest entreaty of every dedicated servant of God. We are determined never to stop learning and never to stop applying what we learn. At times we need to be readjusted, and as did the psalmist, we need to beg God to unify our heart so that it will not be divided. The program at the “Divine Teaching” District Convention will provide the practical instruction and readjustment that we need in order to serve Jehovah faithfully amid the pressures of this system of things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Four-Day Convention: </span><span class="font2">The program will be presented at 156 convenient locations throughout the United States. The February 15, 1993, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> provides a complete listing of these locations. In addition to being in English, the entire program will be presented in Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. At 16 locations there will be sign-language interpreting. The program will begin on Thursday at 1:20 p.m. and will conclude Sunday afternoon at approximately 4:15 p.m. Doors will open at each convention at 7:30 each morning. Please note that no one will be permitted to enter before 7:30 a.m. unless he is assigned to work prior to that time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> What is in store for us? An abundance of solid spiritual food presented in a variety of ways: talks, demonstrations, interviews, and two dramas. Do not miss any of this vital instruction! In addition, we look forward to renewing old acquaintances and making many new ones. Missionaries serving in foreign assignments may be attending your convention. Take advantage of the opportunity to get to know these faithful brothers and sisters. If you are a parent, include your children in the conversation. The joyful and self-sacrificing spirit of these missionaries may lay the foundation for your young ones to consider a career in full-time service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Will You Bring the Whole Tithe Qnt© fthe Storehouse? </span><span class="font2">At Malachi 3:10, Jehovah promised the Israelites that if they were willing to put him to the test and bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, he would pour out a blessing until there was no more want.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> For some, putting Jehovah to the test will mean approaching their employer as soon as possible to ask for vacation or leave time for attending the convention. At times brothers have hesitated to do this, assuming that their employer would never grant them permission to attend a convention. Yet, in matters not involving spiritual things, they may have little or no difficulty in letting their employer know what they want to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> We ought to ask ourselves: If a dear friend was getting married in another area, would we not approach our employer and ask for time off to attend the wedding? And if he appeared to hesitate, would we not respectfully explain how much it would mean to us to be able to go? Surely it is more important to be taught by Jehovah than to attend a wedding! If we are truly convinced that the convention program is vital to our spiritual growth, it will be easier to convince our employer to allow us time off to attend the convention.—James 1:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> In Israel the tithe consisted of material support of Jehovah’s place of worship. In our day the tithe represents the time, energy, and finances that are used directly in Jehovah’s service and in support of the Kingdom work. The tithe includes the time we spend at meetings, assemblies, and conventions, as well as in maintaining and cleaning our meeting places. The “Divine Teaching” District Convention will give us many opportunities to bring the whole tithe into Jehovah’s spiritual storehouse. What are some of these?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> We can bring in the tithe by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">attentively listening</span><span class="font2"> to the convention program, by sharing enthusiastically in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">singing</span><span class="font2"> of each Kingdom song, and by listening carefully to each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prayer,</span><span class="font2"> so that we can add our heartfelt amen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Our progress in the truth is dependent to a considerable extent on how we listen. In a large auditorium or stadium, it is easy to be distracted by what others are doing around us, and for that reason we must keep our thoughts on track. Be sure to come to the convention fully prepared, with your Bible, songbook, pen and notepaper, and the issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to be studied that week. It is helpful to make notes of points and scriptures used by each speaker. Keep the notes brief; taking too many notes may hinder concentration. Young ones too should be trained to be attentive listeners. Children can bring in the tithe along with their parents by following the program as closely as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Some parents arrange for a quiet time at home each day when their young ones are expected to read or to look at the pictures in one of the Society’s publications. This good training makes it much easier for the children to sit quietly during meetings and conventions. Parents who have raised exemplary children say that they never permit their young ones to bring toys or coloring books to meetings. Even very young children can learn that the reason for attending meetings is to worship Jehovah. Parents who teach their young ones what it means for them to bring the whole tithe into the storehouse are truly to be commended!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> We can also bring in the tithe by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">volunteering</span><span class="font2"> our time and energy to assist the convention organization. At most locations a preconvention cleanup is scheduled a day or two before the convention will begin. If you live nearby, why not arrange for the entire family to participate? Some brothers have brought their progressive Bible students along so that even before their baptism these new ones can learn what is involved in supporting Jehovah’s worship. There is plenty to do to ensure that the convention will operate smoothly. Why not volunteer as a family?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> Our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">financial support</span><span class="font2"> of the convention is another way of bringing in the tithe. In outlining how material gifts were to be made to support pure worship, Jehovah commanded the nation of Israel: “None should appear before Jehovah empty-handed. The gift of each one’s hand should be in proportion to the blessing of Jehovah your God that he has given you.” (Deut. 16:16,17) Whether the people were able to give much or little, their offering, prepared in advance, was pleasing to Jehovah. Similarly, many brothers give prayerful thought to the contribution they will make, whether in cash or by check (made out to “Jehovah’s Witnesses”). Do you ever let your small children put a contribution in the box?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Adorn the Teaching of Our Savior, God: </span><span class="font2">By our good manners and our fine conduct, we can “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.” (Titus 2:10) In other words, right at the convention, we can show that divine teaching is being applied in our lives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> What of our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manners?</span><span class="font2"> Consideration for others is rare today in the world. But Jehovah’s people, who are guided by Scriptural principles, think, not of their own advantage, but of the advantage of their fellowman. (Phil. 2:4) We are conscious of others around us. We do not push or shove when lining up for food or publications. We are considerate of the elderly and of small children who may be waiting in line with their parents and who could easily be shoved by adults who may not notice them. In restaurants we are polite and courteous to the staff, not rude or demanding if the service does not measure up to our expectations. And we are happy to comply with the custom of leaving a reasonable tip of 15 percent for services rendered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup> Our godly conduct</span><span class="font2"> has a real impact on those around us. In one convention city last year, a policeman who had been with the force for 21 years had this to say: “I am impressed with the discipline of your people. [They are] outstanding; they pick up trash without anyone asking them, and they are orderly. Your convention is well organized.” He added: “When your people see us, they smile. That’s a good sign. We look for that. That’s a sign of friendliness and nothing to hide. And we also notice how the children are with their parents and are well disciplined. Believe me, I am impressed. It’s enjoyable being assigned here.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> Some officials made a special trip to Bethel to extend an invitation to hold a convention in their city. The Society accepted the kind invitation, and the city fathers were not disappointed. The deputy city manager said: “We’re very excited about having as prestigious a group as yours convene in our city. We made a major effort to get you here . . . and we couldn’t be more pleased.” By their fine conduct, each brother and sister contributed to the excellent witness that was given there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> Will you personally adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, by your exemplary conduct?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Here are a number of ways that this can be done:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dress and grooming: </span><span class="font2">During the time we are attending a convention, we should not consider ourselves to be on vacation. Rather, we are presenting ourselves to Jehovah to be taught by him. Since that is the case, should we not dress as we would when attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall? (1 Tim. 2:9,10) In addition, we should give careful thought to what we will wear after the sessions are over. Upon returning to our accommodations, would it be consistent for us, whatever our age, to exchange our modest, dignified convention attire for clothing that would give us the appearance of slovenly dressed and unkempt worldlings? Would this not give the impression that our meeting clothes are nothing more than a costume rather than a reflection of our way of life? Remember, we are bearing the name of Jehovah, and each of us must see to it that legitimate accusation is not brought against the way of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Baptismal candidates should be reminded that it is inappropriate on such a sacred occasion to wear T-shirts with worldly slogans, logos, or commercial advertising. The elders should ensure that the baptism questions are reviewed well in advance and that each candidate is told in good time whether he is approved for baptism or not. (When going over the questions, it may be an appropriate time to offer suggestions regarding proper, modest attire for baptism.) It will not be necessary for baptismal candidates who have been approved by the elders to register at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Hotels and motels: </span><span class="font2">Display the fruitage of the spirit when checking in at your hotel or motel. Hotel personnel may not be equipped to handle a large group in a short time. Be patient, have empathy, and tip appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Children can do their part by showing respect for hotel property and by obeying rules governing the use of the swimming pool and other facilities. It would be helpful for parents to spend some time prior to the convention reviewing with their children the kind of behavior that will be expected of them, reminding them of their personal responsibility to conform to Christian standards of conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recording devices: </span><span class="font2">While video cameras are permitted, we know you will be considerate of others. It would not be loving to block the view of fellow conventioners while filming the program. If you can record discreetly from your seat, there will be no objection to your doing so. Please remember, however, that no cameras or recording devices are to be connected to the electrical or sound systems at the convention, nor should equipment be placed in aisles or in traffic areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Seating: </span><span class="font2">Please keep in mind that SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR. Special sections for elderly and disabled ones will be available at all conventions. Please be considerate of the elderly. In times past, some older brothers have had to look for seats in inconvenient areas because younger ones filled the seats in the section for the elderly. We are sorry that it will not be possible for us to accommodate requests for separate areas or rooms for those with problems such as allergies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal items: </span><span class="font2">It is suggested that you keep to a minimum any personal items you bring to the convention. If an item does not fit under your seat, it may be better to leave it at home or in the trunk of the car. Large coolers are not permitted in the aisles for safety reasons, and if they are put on the seat next to you, someone may be deprived of a seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature and food service: </span><span class="font2">All of US want to show appreciation for God’s good gifts, seeing to it that nothing is wasted. (John 6:12) As in the past, we suggest that one family member obtain the food for the family. To ensure that no more is taken than you need, why not make a list of what each one requires, and then stick to the list when ordering? Keep in mind that food is not to be taken away from the convention site for later use elsewhere. Parents should speak to their children about not wasting food. Please show loving concern for others when literature is distributed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> In loving consideration for others, plan an early arrival each day, especially on Thursday when it will likely take longer than usual to find parking and seating.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>19</sup> How privileged we are to be taught by Jehovah! Our use of our time, energy, and material resources to support the “Divine Teaching” District Convention this summer will result in lasting spiritual benefits both to ourselves and to our families.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark7"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Decorum: </span><span class="font10">It is important that all attending the convention observe proper decorum, reverentially viewing the place of assembly as “the house of God.” (Ps. 55:14) During the talks, dramas, songs, and particularly the prayers, please avoid doing anything that would divert the attention of others listening to the program. Moving about unnecessarily, carrying on conversations, or using flash cameras or video recorders in a way that distracts those trying to concentrate on what is being said would not be showing respect. Our thoughtfulness and fine conduct will demonstrate that we sincerely appreciate divine teaching and have come to the convention to be instructed by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming: </span><span class="font10">Your cooperation in using only the listing of accommodations provided by the convention is very much appreciated. If you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city and have not already confirmed a reservation, please do so immediately. If you find it necessary to cancel your reservation, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible so that the room can be available for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms are promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers: </span><span class="font10">In many locations baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors and aisles or between rows of seats. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. So please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism: </span><span class="font10">Baptismal candidates should be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. A </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font10"> bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to the baptismal candidates and then call for a song. After the last verse, the attendants will direct the baptismal candidates to the immersion site or to vehicles that will take them there. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal candidates embrace or hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font10">Volunteer help is needed for the smooth operation of a district convention. Even if you may be able to work for only a part of the convention, your services will be appreciated. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also contribute to the success of the convention, but they are required to work with a parent or other responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Badge Cards: </span><span class="font10">Please </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font10"> the specially designed badge card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. Being identified as a convention delegate by a clearly inscribed badge card will facilitate the operation of the simplified food service arrangement. Badge cards should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font10"> be available at the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Identification: </span><span class="font10">In addition to the “Divine Teaching” Convention lapel card, each one is encouraged to have on his person his Advance Medical Directive. Bethel family members and pioneers should also have their identification cards with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Words of Caution: </span><span class="font10">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> times and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">never </span><span class="font10">leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets, who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the convention. There have even been a few reports of unscrupulous individuals attempting to lure children away from the convention area. Please be careful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been reported that some motets provide easy access to television movies with immoral content or even of a pornographic nature. This highlights the need to prevent unsupervised TV watching by children at these places of lodging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some brothers and interested persons have called the management of the convention facility seeking information about starting times for the sessions and other matters. Please do not do this. If the information you need cannot be found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> you should write to the convention address found on the back of the Special Needs Room Request forms on file with each congregation secretary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Appreciation for the Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “To the making of many books there is no end.” (Eccl. 12:12) Many books are not worth the paper they are printed on. However, that is not the case with literature published by the Watchtower Society. It is valuable because it contains lifesaving spiritual food. It helps interested ones to come to know Jehovah, and it strengthens the faith of those who are already Jehovah’s dedicated servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> We want to share our literature with others since we know they can benefit from it. Even though it is pro vided without charge, there are expenses involved in production and distribution. Therefore, we do not want to hand out the publications indiscriminately. If we are not sure of the householder’s interest, we will normally offer individual copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> or perhaps only a tract. We should call back on everyone who accepts literature, and if interest is shown at that time, we might offer another publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Some are hesitant to tell housemap giving directions to each location. ANY PUBLISHER NEEDING ACCOMMODATIONS MAY OBTAIN LODGING INFORMATION THROUGH THE CONGREGATION ELDERS.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ The Society is now producing English bound volumes of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">for the years 1986 to 1991 as permanent stock items. Any interested in obtaining these bound volumes should request them through the congregation. Future years of the English </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> bound volumes, as well as those for 1992, will be permanent stock items and may be requested at any time. Please bear in mind that bound volumes are special-request items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Another release on computer diskettes is available: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References/Insight on the Scriptures. </span><span class="font10">This release contains the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font10"> and both volumes of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Insight.</span><span class="font10"> This is available only in English on 5 1/4-inch 1.2-megabyte or 3 1/2-inch 1.44-megabyte diskettes. A computer with a hard disk having a minimum of 18 megabytes of free space is required. A letter sent to all congregations provides additional information about this new item and how to request it. Diskettes containing only the Bible will continue to be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The Society is now working on a CD-ROM to use with computers. This is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">holders that the work is supported by voluntary contributions, but in most cases it is good to do this. This makes it clear to householders that our work is not commercial. It keeps to the fore that our objective is to preach the Kingdom good news and make disciples. It helps us to discern genuine interest. People often have money for things like tobacco and worldly literature. If they are sincerely interested in what you have told them, they will see the logic of contributing to support genuine Christianity. By explaining how the work is supported, we demonstrate our appreciation for the literature. We show we realize that it costs something to produce it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When the matter of contributions is properly presented, many householders are pleased to help with our vital work. There may be times when you feel it is not appropriate to mention the donation arrangement, but generally it is good to mention it on the initial call when the householder is interested in reading the literature that we offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a compact disk with read-only memory. It will allow one to view on a computer screen any reference from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Insight</span><span class="font10"> volumes, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> from 1950 to 1993, and many other of our copyrighted publications. The CD-ROM will include a versatile, Society-designed program to search those publications. An appropriate device for reading CD-ROMs will be needed. This CD-ROM should be available early next year. Please do not write or telephone the Society for information. When technical information is finalized, we will send a letter to all congregations, giving details about equipment needed to use this new CD-ROM.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul adapted his presentation of the good news that he “might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Likewise, we will be more successful in our ministry if we are alert to discern the householder’s interests and are prepared to adapt our discussion to his needs. This should not be difficult when offering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> or one of our brochures.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup>After introducing yourself, you might begin by saying in your own words something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Many people despair at the apparent inability of world governments to provide workable solutions to the problems of our times. Some even blame the governments for their problems. Do you think there could be a government able to care adequately for all our needs? [Allow for response.] Do you know we have a reliable promise of a government that will definitely do away with all the problems we face?” Listen carefully to the householder’s answer. Depending on what he says, be ready to branch off into one of several different presentations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If there is an indication in the householder’s comments that he professes to be Christian, we could then ask if he prays the “Our Father,” or Lord’s Prayer. If he answers in the affirmative, we could recite the model prayer to the point where it says, “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:9,10) This proves that someday Jehovah’s will is going to be done here on earth. Reference can then be made to an appropriate article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> or to a brochure that follows through on this thought, such as page 3 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That Will Bring Paradise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If the householder evidences no faith in God, you could refer to Hebrews 3:4 and then turn to page 4 of the brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us? </span><span class="font10">Read paragraphs 1 and 2 and ask the question listed at the bottom of the page. Or you could tie in appropriate material from a current magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If the householder appears satisfied with his lot in life, you could raise the question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">□ “Why should we seriously consider what the Bible says about the future of government?” Then we could use the information found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book on pages 154 and 155, mentioning briefly one or more of the eight reasons provided therein. If the householder demonstrates interest, use the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?,</span><span class="font10"> beginning with the first paragraph on page 2, to further the conversation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Your initial call will not be entirely successful if you do not whet the appetite of the householder for another visit. Therefore, be certain to ask an interesting question and promise to answer it when you return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> From the material above, select what you feel comfortable in saying. Adjust these suggestions to fit your territory. Become familiar with the brochures, tracts, and magazine articles you are going to use so that you can quickly adapt your discussion to the needs of the householder. May we all prepare our presentations diligently “for the sake of the good news” and thus share successfully in this lifesaving ministry.—1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Joyfully Return to Help Interested Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Everyone who shares in the house-to-house work desires to help people who are interested. By giving such help, we experience deep joy and satisfaction. (Compare Psalm 126:5,6.) This requires that we be prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Preparation starts with keeping detailed information on our house-to-house record. Note the subject discussed on the initial call and the householder’s reaction. You may even want to make a note of how you want to begin the conversation when you return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> For example, if you referred to the Lord’s iPrayer initially and then placed the “Government” brochure, you could briefly state something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “On my previous visit, we discussed how God’s will is going to be done on earth and that peace will be realized in all areas of life. In the brochure I left, please notice what it says on page 29 about the other blessings God’s Kingdom will bring to mankind.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If the person was inclined to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ward disbelief in God, say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “When I called earlier, we were discussing the point Paul made at Hebrews 3:4, giving logical reasons for concluding that there must be an intelligent Maker of all things.” Read the scripture again and refer to pages 4 through 9 of the brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?,</span><span class="font10"> picking up where your initial presentation left off. Ask the question and then read the paragraph, allowing the householder to answer the question. If practical, invite him to get his brochure and consider the material together.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If the householder appeared satisfied, materially or otherwise, during your initial call, you could again refer to the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font10"> and read what is stated on page 6. Ask the householder if he desires to live on a beautiful paradise earth. To help in further determining his interest, you might ask for his comments on an encouraging picture or statement in a magazine you are using.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> This same basic approach can be used with an article you may have discussed in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">Refer to the article highlighted on your initial visit and then mention another point of interest in the same article or one in another issue you have with you. If possible, read a scripture together and ask for the householder’s comments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> When sufficient interest is shown, a subscription may be offered. Usually this would be done only after the householder has demonstrated clear appreciation for several issues of the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Keep in mind your goal of starting a Bible study. Ordinarily it takes several calls to develop the interest to that extent. Show your personal concern for the householder by returning as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> The good news that we proclaim causes great joy. (Luke 2:10) When interested persons respond to our efforts, this is certainly a cause for rejoicing. (Phil. 4:1) Let us reap such joy by returning to help the interested ones we find in the field.</span></p></li></ul>

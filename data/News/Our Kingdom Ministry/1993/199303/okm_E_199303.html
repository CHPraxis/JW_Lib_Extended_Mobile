<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">March 1993 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 36, No. 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep On Saying: “Come!”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a marvelous provision Jehovah has made through Jesus’ ransom sacrifice! In this we find the basis for all that is needed to make people really happy. (John 3:16) Sad to say, however, very few have come to know and believe this truth firmly. Still, In his loving concern for mankind, Jehovah has arranged to make this good news known to people everywhere. Through his Son, Jesus Christ, he has extended to all the opportunity to find happiness and the hope of everlasting life.—John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> For thousands of years, the identity of the One who would ransom mankind from sin and death was unknown. It was a “sacred secret” until Christ Jesus came and “shed light upon life and incorruption through the good news.&quot; (Rom. 16:25; 2 Tim. 1:10) Jesus’ followers took up the proclamation of this good news in the first century; now we who are living in modem times have the exalted privilege of declaring this same good news. When we preach the Kingdom message, we are sharing with Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and the brothers of Christ, who Invite people of all walks of life by saying: “Come!. . . take life’s water free.”—Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Of course, not everyone will listen to this good news. Very few pay close attention. Some rudely reject God’s servants, who invite them to benefit from life-giving waters of truth. Even so, with strength from Jehovah, we persevere in this work. We know that our willingness to speak the truth and to help any who will hear is pleasing to Jehovah and brings his blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In our ministry for March, we will encourage seekers of truth to read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font10"> book and rejoice in the hope it sets forth. They will reap many blessings from doing so. After all. the book of Revelation is about the future—their future and ours. Some who are now dedicated servants of Jehovah first became interested in the truth after reading explanations of the book of Revelation in one of the Society's publications. Having recently made a detailed study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font10"> book ourselves, we can appreciate its Importance to those of honest heart who are hungering for the truth. As we find such ones in our ministry, we will endeavor to point out one or two highlights from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax </span><span class="font10">book to show them its value. Among other things, we can point to its clear explanations of Bible prophecies that have been fulfilled in this 20th century, such as the remarkable ride of the symbolic horsemen described in the sixth chapter of Revelation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is most appropriate for us to talk about Jehovah’s loving provisions for mankind as we prepare to celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death on April 6. Whether people choose to listen or not, we persevere in our God-given assignment to extend the heartening invitation to anyone that wishes: “Come!... take life’s water free.”</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Celebrating the Death That Gives Hope of Everlasting Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> After sundown on April 6,1993, we will celebrate the death of the Chief Agent of life. (Acts 3:15) Indeed, it is most fitting to commemorate the life and death of Jesus Christ. Our very hope of living forever rests on Jesus' shed blood.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial underscores the significance of the death of Christ in the outworking of Jehovah's purpose. That purpose includes providing the perfect human sacrifice needed to ransom Adam’s offspring, making it possible for billions to exercise faith and live forever on a paradise earth.—John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> All lovers of truth and life look forward to celebrating the Lord’s Evening Meal in obedience to Jesus’ command. (Luke 22:19) What can we do individually to show our appreciation for the provision of Christ’s ransom sacrifice? In recognition of the significance of this celebration, good organization is very important. What preparations are you making for this special event?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Advance Preparation Necessaryi </span><span class="font10">Of course, we will ensure that every member of the family will be present. We should also prepare mentally by reading and meditating on the Bible passages noted on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1993 Calendar </span><span class="font10">for April 1-6. It would be appropriate to include information on the significance of the Memorial in our personal and family Bible study just prior to April 6. Plan to arrive early and stay a little while after the Memorial celebration is concluded so that you will be on hand to welcome new ones who may be attending for the first time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In the weeks before the Memorial, invite all the interested persons you know to this celebration. Printed invitations have been Included In the congregation’s yearly shipment of forms. When using these, remember to inform interested persons of the address and time of the local celebration. Prepare a list of those you wish to invite. Do all who wish to attend have transportation? If not, what can you do to assist them? If you have extra room in your car, why not ask the elders if someone needs transportation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Because this is the most important celebration of the year and a large attendance is expected, the elders will need to make special advance preparations. (1 Cor. 14:40) A week or so before April 6, the elders will arrange for a special meeting with the brothers who will assist with the celebration, making sure that they understand the seating arrangements and how the emblems are to be passed. If you are assigned to assist during the celebration as an attendant or a server, be sure to follow the elders’ directions closely with regard to these matters. By checking the reminders in the box on page 7, the elders can make sure that all arrangements for the attendants, servers, emblems, and speaker are cared for well in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Only a few of Christ’s brothers remain on earth today, and in the not-too-distant future, the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal will have come to its completion. (1 Cor. 11:25, 26) As long as it is our privilege to do so, may we fittingly keep celebrating the death that gives hope of everlasting life.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Can You Do More to Honor Jehovah?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> That is a vital question for all of us to consider. As faithful imitators of our Master, Jesus Christ, we honor our God today by making public declaration to his name. This is a responsibility that we must shoulder if we are to gain God’s favor. (Mark 13: 10; Luke 4:18; Acts 4:20; Heb. 13:15) What an indescribable p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rivilege</span><span class="font12">—yes, honor—to carry this good news to the remaining scattered “sheep” who may yet become part of Jehovah’s universal fold!—John 10:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Can you and your children do more to honor Jehovah by increasing your activity in the ministry? In ever-increasing numbers worldwide, your brothers and sisters are entering the pioneer service. During the month of April 1992, a peak of 172*145 in the United States were in the special, regular, or auxiliary </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">pio</span><span class="font12">neer service Have you personally given serious consideration to pioneering?_Do you encourage your children to pursue a career in the full-time ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Why not analyze your personal feelings toward pioneer service? Whenever the subject is mentioned, do you quickly conclude that your circumstances simply do not per</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">mit you to serve as a pionee</span><span class="font12">r minister? It is true that pioneering is not possible for everyone. Scriptural </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">responsibilities</span><span class="font12"> and other limitations prevent many from serving full-time. (1 Tim. 5:8) But have you recently given the matter prayerful thought? Have you discussed the subject as a family to see if at least one member can pioneer? The November 15,1982, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch.-tower</span><span class="font12"> made this thought-provoking statement on page </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">23:</span><span class="font12"> “Really, every Christian minister should prayerfully consider whether he can pioneer or not. A South African couplq who have pioneered for fifteen years said: /Why are we pioneering? Could we ever justify it before Jehovah if we did not?’ Many who are not pioneers could well ask the related question: ‘Can I really justify before Jehovah the fact that I am not a pioneer?’”)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Another </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article on the subject made this pointed comment: ^Each of us should be honest </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">with himsel</span><span class="font12">f. Do you say, The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak’? But is the spirit </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">eally</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font12">willing? Let us avoid using the weakness of the flesh as an excuse for the unwillingness of the spir-it.”^-w78 8/15JJ. 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Parents Who Want Their Children to Succeed: </span><span class="font12">Proverbs 15:20 assures us: “A wise son is the one that makes a father rejoice.” Godly parents unquestionably rejoice when their sons and daughters pursue, a life of dedicated service to Jehovah. However, your children will not automatically choose the wise course. The allurement of this world is very powerful. Parents, your children’s values are largely shaped by your own. If you always speak positively about the benefits of full-time service, if you encourage your young ones to seek out_the company of devoted pioneers, if you are truly convinced that the full-time ministry is the most honorable career your children could ever undertake, this positive att</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">it</span><span class="font12">ude will undoubtedly have a great impact, on your children. Help them to appreciate the value of making a good name with Jehovah rather than with men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Young people, Proverbs^ 22:1 highlights the choice you have to maker “A n</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ame is to bq chosen</span><span class="font12"> rather than abundant riches; fa-vor~isTietter than even silver and gold.”' What kind of name will you make for yourself? Think of the men and women we read about in the Bible who made a name with God through dedicated service. There was Luke, the beloved physician, and Enoch, who walked with the true God. Samuel received the finest education possible, beginning his service at Jehovah’s temple at a tender age. Do you think these faithful servants ever regretted the choices they made? Why would they? All of them led happy, productive, and exciting lives. And they found lasting favor with Jehovah!—Ps. 110:3; 148:12, 13; Prov. 20:29a; 1 Tim. 4:8b.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> When children make a success of life, their parents feel a sense of pride. Their inv</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">estment</span><span class="font12"> in the training, disciplining, and educating of this “inheritance from Jehovah” is repaid </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">many time</span><span class="font12">s over. (Ps. 127:3) What could make any parent prouder than a son or a daughter who does all he or she can to honor Jehovah? Many young people in modern times are following in the footsteps of Luke, Enoch, and Samuel, as one letter illustrates?^! am 16.1 started regular pioneering ... nine months after I was baptized, and I have been receiving blessings from Jehovah ever since.... Pioneering also helps you in school. Before, I would get teased about being a Witness by my classmates. Now, since I have to do a lot more personal study, I am able to ‘make a reply to the one that is taunting me.’”')</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Education to Equip One in the Minis* try: </span><span class="font12">At this point we might consider the question of secular education. This is an area where a balanced viewpoint is especially needed. The November 1,1992, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> featured the article “Education With a Purpose.” /Under the subheading </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Ad</span><span class="font12">equate Education,” this point was made: “Christians should be able to support themselves, even if they are full-time pioneer ministers. (2 Thessalonians 3:10-12)... How much </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">educat</span><span class="font12">ion does a young Christian need in order to respect these Bible principles and meet his Christian obligations? ... What [wages] might be termed ‘adequate’... for those who wish to be pioneer ministers of the good news? Such ones generally need part-time work to avoid putting ‘an expensive burden’ upon their brothers or their family.—1 Thessalonians 2:9.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> If supplementary education is deemed necessary by the prospective pioneer in order to help him to pursue full-time service, the November 1, 1992, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Wat</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">chtower</span><span class="font12"> recommends:, “A young Witness would do well, if at all possible, to take this while living at home, thus being able to maintain normal Christian study habits, meeting attendance, and preaching activity.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> From Africa comes the experience of a 22-year-old youth who had to go to trade school, though his heart was in the pioneer service. While at the trade school, he enrolled as an auxiliary pioneer. His peers made fun of him, saying he would surely fail his examinations. His answer to them always was: (“Seek first God’s Kingdom and his righteousness.” ^Exercising selfdiscipline, he would rise very early each morning and do two hours’ preparation for classes and then share in the field service in the afternoon when classes werejover. The whole school was stunned when this youth placed third in a special examination to select the best three students for a special sponsorship award. The student who came in second was an interest</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed person</span><span class="font12"> with whom our pioneer bro</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ther studie</span><span class="font12">d the Bible at school. The student who placed first was another zealous Witness youth in the school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Elders Do Their Part: </span><span class="font12">Congregation elders, who are proud of the work the pioneersFare doing, provide great encouragement for these zealous ministers. Elders are pleased to do this because they know that hardworking, productive pioneers are a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">blessing to any congregation. After spending a year or so in regular pioneer service, such ones become eligible for extra training in the Pioneer Service School. The course has proved to be an invaluable tool in improving the effectiveness of the pioneers. Although the pioneers are at the forefront of the work, they too nee</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">d loving </span><span class="font12">encouragement, and the elders should be alert to fill this need.—1 Pet. 5:1-3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;"> How can the elders give stimulus to</span><span class="font12"> the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">pioneer work?</span><span class="font12"> A good starting point would be to evaluate periodically who might be able to reac</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">h ou</span><span class="font12">t for this privilege. Elders could approach individuals who seem to be in a favorable position to pioneer, including many who auxiliary pioneer on a regular basis, retired persons, housewives, and students.

At times, after a whole night of fishing, their nets were still empty. (John 21:3) In parts of this country where the ‘fishing for men’ has proceeded for years, some pioneers may conclude that there are few “fish” remaining in t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">heir congregation</span><span class="font12"> “waters.” (Matt. 4:19) In contrast, are we not thrilled to read reports coming from other lands, where publishers and pioneers are conducting many Bible studies? The joy experienced by pioneers and missionaries in these lands is clearly evident. (w92 9/1 p. 20 par. 15) Thus, if some hardworking pioneers could be in a positi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">on to relocate</span><span class="font12"> to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">a .country</span><span class="font12"> where there is a greater need, they should consider this with their branch office b</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">efore</span><span class="font12"> making such a move &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">■ Is it proper to reproduce publications of the Society for distribution to others?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Over the years, the Society has produced a wide range of publications dealing with virtually every aspect of Bible knowledge. Individuals who have learned the truth in recent years may feel that they have missed out on the benefits of material published in the past and that is no longer available through the Society. Some have gone to considerable lengths to obtain copies of older publications, and others have taken it upon themselves to reproduce Society publications and make them available in various ways. This has Included actual reprints of publications as well as computer reproductions. In some cases, this has been done for a financial profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The faithful “slave” is aware of our spiritual needs and makes provisions “at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45) When there has been a need for reissuing material published in the past. the Society has made arrangements for such. For example, bound volumes of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> from 1960 to 1985 have been reprinted and made available to all. However, when individuals take the initiative on their own to reproduce and distribute such material, unnecessary problems can develop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Serious difficulties are created when this material is reproduced and distributed for financial gain. The Question Box in the June 1977 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font10"> stated: “It is best not to exploit theocratic associations by either initiating or advertising the sale of any goods or services for commercial advantage in the Kingdom Hall, at congregation book studies and at assemblies of Jehovah’s people. This will aid us to give spiritual interests the full attention they deserve and to keep commercial activity in its proper place.” Therefore, it is important that we avoid becoming profit-minded when it comes to commercializing God’s Word or matters related to it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> It has been said that variety </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">is. </span><span class="font10">the spice of life. Often, a different approach to asubject can make it more interesting. This is no less true of pyr ministry. If we are not careful, our door-to-door presentations can easily become stereotyped. Repeating the same introductions over and over can become tiresome both to us and to the householders. Therefore, be ve</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">rsatil</span><span class="font10">e in your ministry. But how can you accomplish this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Rather than saying something like, ‘Good morning. We“are calling on our neighbors with the good news of the Kingdom,’ why not think of ways to vary your opening words? The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book contains a wealth of information about introductions. On pages </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">9-15</span><span class="font10">, there are introductions on 18 different_s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ubject</span><span class="font10">s. And there are two, three, or more possible introductions for most subjects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you are using the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?, ’’ this introduction from the section “Life/Happiness&quot; on page 13 may be helpful:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “We’re speaking with people who are</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping All Who Have Shown Interest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our faith and our love for others will move us during March to help and invite to the Memorial all who have shown interest in the Kingdom message. Such ones need to be led to Jehovah’s provision of salvation, which centers on Christ’s ransom sacrifice. —Heb. 9:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is a good idea to make a list of those you want to invite to the Memorial. Include any who attend meetings occasionally as well as those who have previously studied or in other ways shown interest. Do not forget unbelieving mates and other family members. After making your list, put forth a special effort to call on each one. You may wish to ask the elders to assist you in making certain calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What can you say on the call? </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After a warm greeting, you can say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “In the past, you have shown an intruly concerned about the quality of life today. Many wonder, Is a genuinely happy life possible? This brochure provides an encouraging and thoughtprovoking point of view.&quot; Open the brochure to page 25, and read one or two highlights from paragraphs 15 and 16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Some Kingdom publishers—younger and newer ones especially, but older ones as well—have found that an interesting approach at the doors can be made using the tracts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A young publisher might use the tract “Enjoy Family Life&quot; and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I have a brief message for you about how God can bring families together in happiness. I would like to give you this tract entitled </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Family Life.&quot;</span><span class="font10"> The older publisher working along with the young person can then determine whether to add further thoughts or comments, depending on the reaction of the householder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If the householder shows interest, the older publisher may say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “The Bible provides instruction on terest in spiritual things, and I thought that you would appreciate this invitation to a special event. [Hand householder the printed invitation to the Memorial.] The Memorial of Christ’s death is the only event that the Lord Jesus Christ commanded his followers to commemorate. We look forward to reviewing what Christ accomplished by his death and how we can gain everlasting life by means of it. Last year, over 11 million were in attendance at this special meeting. It would be a pleasure to have you Join me in attending this year.&quot; Be sure to write down the time and place your congregation will celebrate the Memorial. Also, offer to provide transportation if that is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’When newcomers attend the Memorial, they should be made welcome. Help them get acquainted with local</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">the proper role of the husband, the wife, and the children in the family arrangement. Since God is the Originator of the family, would you not agree that he is in the best position to tell us how the family should function?

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you feature the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font10"> book, why not highlight the positive view of the future set out at Revelation 21:3, 4? Then read paragraph 7 on page .303 of the book. Ask the householder If it is realistic to believe that God will fulfill these promises. A brief discussion of Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled should strengthen the householder's confidence in God’s man race, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">r <sub>t</sub></span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Of course, simply attending the Memorial will not assure them of salvation. But for many you invite, it could be their first step in exercising faith in Jesus’ shed blood.

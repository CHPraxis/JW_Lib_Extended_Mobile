<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will We Accomplish During This Service Year?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">' With the beginning of the 1994 service year on September 1, it is now an appropriate time for all of us as Jehovah's people to establish clearly in our minds what we wish to accomplish as individuals and as an organization during this new service year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Keep Growing Spiritually: If we are newly associated with the truth, we should desire to become strong in the faith. (Heb. 6:1-3) If we are already spiritually strong, not only should we help new ones and others but we must also pay attention to our own spirituality, never feeling that we have all the necessary Bible knowledge and experience in Christian living. Do we consider the daily text, keep up with the Bible-reading&quot;program set out in the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule, and prepare for the Congregation Book, Study and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> Study?JThat should be a minimum </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">goal</span><span class="font7"> for all of us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">We must keep growing spiritually if we are to survive the destruction of this wicked system of things and be preserved into God’s new world.—Compare Philippians 3:12-16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Remain Spiritually Clean: In order to be fully acceptable before Jehovah, we must be cleansed of “every defilement of flesh and spirit.” (2 Cor. 7:1) Once we are clean, why would we want to ‘roll in the mire’ of this wicked old world again? (Compare 2 Peter 2:22.) We must be determined to remain spiritually strong and clean. Then we will not be ignorant of Satan’s evil designs and be overreached, falling into sin and away from Jehovah’s favor.—2 Cor. 2:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Heed Wise Counsel: Proverbs 15:22 points out: “In the multitude oTcoun-selors there is accomplishment.’&quot; Remember, though, that the man who spoke those words, Solomon, later allowed 'his wives to inclin</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">e his hea</span><span class="font7">rt to follow other gods’ because he failed to heed God’s counsel about not taking foreign wives. (1 Ki. ll:l-4)So unless we personally heed wise counsel, how can we expect to be effective in Jehovah’s service or set an example worthy of being imitated? (1 Tim. 4:15) The Bible’s counsel will help us to safeguard our heart. (Prov. 4:23) Loving what Jehovah loves, hating what he </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hates,</span><span class="font7"> constantly seeking his guidance and the doing of what pleases him are a sure protection. —Prov. 8:13; John 8:29; Heb. 1:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Our worship of Jehovah is not something mechanical, not a form of godly devotion like that of professed Christians in the world, but .spirited, active, and alive in accord with the truth as found in God’s Word—John 4:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Our determination to do God’s will may be challenged daily. We should be fortified by the knowledge that “the entire association ” of our brothers faces similar tests and that it is Jehovah who will make us stropg. (1 Pet. 5:9,10) Thus we will be able fully to accomplish our ministry during the 1994 service year. —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Home Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> One of the most rewarding and satisfying experiences for true Christians is to teach someone the truth by means of a home Bible &quot;study. Yet, some may not be enjoying this enriching feature of the ministry because they feel </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">they </span><span class="font7">are unable to start and conduct a Bible study. Many&quot; outstanding publishers and pioneers once felt that way. However, by trusting in Jehovah and by applying suggestions from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font7"> they learned how to start and conduct Bible studies, and they increased their joy in the ministry. You can have the same goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Using the Direct Method and Tracts: One of the easiest </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ways</span><span class="font7"> to start a study is by the direct </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">metho</span><span class="font7">d. All some people need is a warm invitation to study the Bible. This can be eJone by merely asking the householder..“Would you like to have a personal home Bible study and increase your knowledge of the Bible and God’s purpose for the earth?&quot;Or you could tell the householder that you would be happy to demonstrate the way in which a home Bible study is conducted. Although many may refuse this offer, think of your joy in finding someone who accepts it!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’ Anothe</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">r way</span><span class="font7"> to start a Bible study is by usi</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng one o</span><span class="font7">f </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">our tracts.</span><span class="font7"> Although small in size, they present a message that is powerful and convincing. How can a study be started in a tract? Simply by giving the householder a tract that you believe will intere</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">st him</span><span class="font7">. There take the initiative, and i</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nvite</span><span class="font7"> the householder to read the first paragraph with you. Look up the scriptures cited, and discuss how they apply to the material. On the first </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">call</span><span class="font7">, you might consider only one or two parag</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">raph</span><span class="font7">s. As the householder comes to ap</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">precia</span><span class="font7">te that he is l</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">earning interesting thing</span><span class="font7">s from the Bible, you may be able to </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Increase </span><span class="font7">the time you spend in your discussions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Using Just the Bihio; Sometimes a person is agreeable to discussing the Bible but seems reluctant to </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">accep</span><span class="font7">t a formal study or make use of one of our publications. You can still start and conduct a Bible study by preparing interesting Scriptural discussions based on portions of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book or the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book but then using only the Bible when&quot; risiting the interested person. Such discussions may last 1</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">5 or 20 minutes</span><span class="font7">, or longer, depending on the circumstances. If done regularly and with a progressive </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">metho</span><span class="font7">d~7or teaching Bible truths, you have started a Bible study, and it c</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">an be reported a</span><span class="font7">s such. When the time is right, introduce </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ttiS'Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book, and conduct a formal study in it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> In addition to finding opportunities in the field ministry, have you endeavored to start B</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ible studie</span><span class="font7">s with neighbors, associates, or family members? Was it some time ago? Have you </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">tried </span><span class="font7">again recently? If one method didn’t work, have you considered trying another?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> You can be-successful at starting studies iLyou apply the suggestions given, persevere in the field service, and trustin Jehovah for his blessing. Never underestimate the power of the truth and the help that Jehovah gives. May you increase your joy in the ministry by starting and conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> How happy we are to receive the latest issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> We cherish the opportunity to read them as soon as possible so that we may benefit from the information that is presented. In addition to looking for material that may help us personally, it is a good idea to look for points.that can be used in offering the magazines to otHers. We may wish to mark portions that would be especially appealing to those in our congregation’s territory or even make notes in the margins of our copy to remind ourselves of talking points and how the article could be presented locally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Our journals have enduring value. Although we may primarily give attention to presenting the current magazines, there is no need to discard older i</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ssues</span><span class="font7">, since the informatlOnltself does not go out of date. Keep back issues in your book bag so that they will be available when witnessing. These may be especially useful when a specific need of the householder becomes known. When an older magazine is left, it is all right to mention briefly to the householder his opportunity to contribute to the worldwide work.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> When we preach to others about the good news of the Kingdom, one of our aims should be to help honesthearted ones appreciate the excelling value of God’s Word. (Phil. 3:8) Our Bible-based literature plays an important part in spreading the Kingdom message. For example, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book has helped hundreds of thousands of people to serve Jehovah as a result of the Bible truths they have learned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Our ministry involves more than simply leaving literature with anyone willing to take It. We need to introduce the message in an appealing manner, listen with discernment to what the householder says, and then be ready to 'reason with him from the Scriptures.’ —Acts 17:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> How Can This Be Done? Our introductions can open the way for householders to show whether they are truly interested in the Bible and its message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “We’re calling to discuss the meaning of what’s happening around us in the world today. Among many people there has been declining interest in God and in his standards for living as set out in the Bible. This has greatly influenced the attitude of people toward one another. Have you noticed this? (Allow for comment You may refer to specific instances.] Please note the attitude of those mentioned at 2 Timothy 3:1-5, and tell me whether you think this sounds like the world today. [Read; allow for comment.] Is there sound reason to expect better conditions in the future?” If interest is displayed, refer to the picture on pages 12 and 13 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book and direct attention to paragraphs 12 and 13. If interest is limited, then the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Peaceful New World </span><span class="font7">tract could be offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’ If a parent comes to the door,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">we may start our conversation this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “We're talking to people who are interested in how we can better cope with the problems of family life. We all try to do the best we can, but if there is something that can help us to have greater success, we’re interested, aren’t we? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives direction in this matter as found at Colossians 3:12-14. [Read.] So, what is necessary to enjoy a successful family life? Note what is stated in this publication in the chapter entitled ’Making a Success of Family Life.”’ Read paragraph 3 on page 238 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font7">book. If the householder is busy or does not readily respond, try presenting a recent magazine that discusses family matters or the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Family Life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> We never want to lose sight of our purpose in giving a thorough witness about the Kingdom. (Matt 24:14) By making good use of the Bible and the wonderful provisions of theocratic literature available to us, we can confidently look to Jehovah for his blessing in accomplishing his will during these momentous times.—Gal. 6:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Before the foundation can be laid, though, we need to prepare the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">build</span><span class="font7">ing site, as it were, taking into consideration the circumsta</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nces of th</span><span class="font7">e householder.

<p><span class="font7">■ “I’m so glad to find you at home. You may recall that when we had our last discussion, we considered the declining interest in God locally. The Bible clearly outlines that God is interested in mankind and that righteous ones will be blessed through his Kingdom. [Read Matthew 6:9, 10.] By means of this Kingdom, righteousness and justice will prevail.” Read Isaiah 11:3-5, and then draw the householder’s attention to the first two paragraphs of chapter 1 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book.

Emphasize that in order to live in the new world, we must take in accurate knowledge. Read John 17:3. Explain that after taking in such knowledge, we must do God’s will. Read 1 John 2:17.

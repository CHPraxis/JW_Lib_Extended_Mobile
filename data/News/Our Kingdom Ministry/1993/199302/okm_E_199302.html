<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Cooperating With Our</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Book Study Conductor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The Congregation Book Study plays a vital role in the development of our abilities as ministers of the good news. The groups are purposely kept small to encourage a warm, familylike atmosphere for study of the Bible and one of the Society’s publications. These smaller units also provide ideal conditions for training us to be more effective in the field ministry. Personal encouragement and attention are readily available to individuals through the book study arrangement. How can we cooperate fully with the conductor and benefit from this fine provision?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Zealous Share in the Field Min* istry: </span><span class="font7">One of the most important responsibilities of the book study conductor is to help every member of the group to have a zealous share in the ministry. In this regard, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font7"> book reminds us on page 44 that “the regularity, zeal and enthusiasm that he shows for the field activity will be reflected in the publishers.” At times message. (Rom. 10:13-15; 1 Tim. 2:4) We recognize the urgency of the-tknes and the need for diligencejp proclaiming God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">' While the organization is moving forward, how a</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">re we doing</span><span class="font7"> individually? Are we determined to have a full share in the vital disciple-making work? To accomplish this, we should set perso</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nal goals</span><span class="font7">. Can we be more diligent in following up interest? Why not set a goal of star</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ting</span><span class="font7"> a new Bible study du</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ring the month of Februar</span><span class="font7">y?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■' Who Can Conduct a Bible Study?: </span><span class="font7">Many publishers from a variety of backgrounds have had the joy of conducting a Bible study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book. The simplicity of its style makes conduc</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ting easi</span><span class="font7">er, enabling even newer publishers to have a shye in this important work. In addition, many of us have studied it personally, so we are familiar with its contents. One the conductor will work in the service with members of his own family, but he will also be happy to accompany others in various features of the ministry as his circumstances permit. Can you regularly support meetings for field service? Your doing so will be very much appreciated by your book study conductor and other publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’Meetings for field service are arranged at convenient locations so that all may have a zealous share in the preaching work. While giving consideration to local conditions, each group will want to get an early start in the ministry. Many publishers and pioneers have fine success when they continue in the ministry past the noon hour on the weekend.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Would you like to have assistance in some feature of the ministry? Perhaps your book study conductor can arrange for a capable publisher in the group to work with you. At the end of the month, be sure to turn in your field publisher who had conducted no Bible studies lief ore using the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font7">book wrote In appreciation: (“I have three studies and a fourth one ready to start. I cannot say thank you enough for-making Bible studies easy to conduct.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> You</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng ones</span><span class="font7">, too, are having an active share in the Bible study work by using the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book. </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">One voung </span><span class="font7">b</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">rother</span><span class="font7"> leaves the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">book on his desk</span><span class="font7"> at school. This has paved the way for good discussions and several Bible studies. So</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">me youngste</span><span class="font7">rs have used the direct approach by </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">asking parent</span><span class="font7">s they meet in the door-to-door ministry for permission to ha</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve a Bible stud vwith-</span><span class="font7">thnir children. Our children are never too young to talk about Jehovah’s promise of eternal life on a paradise earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> Whether you</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng or old</span><span class="font7">, one of the gr</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">eatest joys</span><span class="font7"> anyone can have in the ministry is that of conducting a home B</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ible study</span><span class="font7">. So let each of us pray for Jehovah’s help and seize every opportunity to declare our hope publicly. Use the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book to help others to learn how they can have a share in praising our God, Jehovah—Ps. 148: 12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">service report promptly. Both the book study conductor and the secretary will appreciate your cooperation in this important area as well.—Compare Luke 16:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> When the Service Overseer Visits the Group: </span><span class="font7">The service overseer usually visits one book study group each month in order to encourage greater and more meaningful activity in the field ministry. Pay close attention to the 15-minute talk he delivers at the conclusion of the book study, as it will provide specific counsel that will help the group to improve in various features of the preaching work. The service overseer is also eager to work with different members of the book study on the weekend. Be sure to take advantage of this special provision so that you can benefit from his experience and ability in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Our personal example of cooperation and our willingness to assist less experienced ones will help create a warm, friendly atmosphere at the Congregation Book Study as we “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” —Gal. 6:10.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.&quot;—John 3:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Appreciate Jesus Christ’s Love: </span><span class="font7">Likewise, it is fitting that we show deep appreciation for Jesus Christ, who gave his soul as a ransom for many. (Matt. 20:28) His love is manifest in his willingly submitting to Jehovah’s will for him in connection with the ransom. Consider how he gave up his favorable circumstances in association with his Father and myriads of righteous angels in order to be our ransom. Neither the challenge of living among and being subject to sinful humans nor the knowledge that providing the ransom called for his death deterred him. Rather, he “took a slave’s form and came to be in the Ukeness of men. More than that.... he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.”—Phil. 2:5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How Do We Show Appreciation for the Ransom?: </span><span class="font7">Our appreciation for the ransom must go beyond a mere thank-you. We need to learn about God’s provision for salvation through Jesus Christ. (John 17:3) Then we must exercise faith in the ransom. (Acts 3:19) In turn, we must be motivated to give ourselves to Jehovah God in dedication and be baptized. (Matt. 16:24) As we live up to our dedication, we should buy out every opportunity to tell others about the wonderful ransom provision for salvation.—Rom. 10:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> It is not beyond the capability of any one of us to meet these requirements. Micah 6:8 assures us: “And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?” Similarly, David said to Jehovah: “Everything is from you, and out of your own hand we have given to you.&quot; —1 Chron. 29:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">* To deepen our appreciation for Jehovah’s marvelous provision, why not read and discuss chapters 112 to 126 in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font7"> book as a family before the Memorial date? In this way, all of us can prepare ourselves mentally to show appreciation for the ransom at the Memorial celebration that will be held on April 6,1993.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">■ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the requirement of hours, elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1,1992, and October 1,1991. Also, see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> insert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ On Saturday, May 8,1993, the Brooklyn Bethel Home and factory, as well as Watchtower Farms buildings, will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ The Memorial celebration will be held Tuesday, April 6, 1993. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font7"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than for field service are to be held on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Tuesday, you may want to switch those to another time of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If your Service Meeting is affected, it may be possible to incorporate into another Service Meeting any parts scheduled for that week that are particularly applicable to your congregation. Congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer should reschedule the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">■ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March and April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient literature on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ All resident aliens in the United States who were issued green cards prior to 1978 must apply for and obtain a new card. The new card will have the photograph, fingerprint, and signature of the individual. Filing early is suggested. Application forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-755-0777 or the local INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) office. Compliance with this legal requirement will prevent certain employment and travel problems and is in harmony with Romans chapter 13.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Simple and Effective Presentations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God in a simple and straightforward manner. He knew that sheeplike ones would react favorably when they heard the truth. He also knew that people differ in their thinking, interests, and reasoning ability. Accordingly, he used a variety of uncomplicated introductions, questions, and illustrations in order to capture the attention of his listeners and to touch their hearts. We can imitate his example and make good use of simple and effective presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">- Use the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book Effectively: </span><span class="font7">The first introduction under the heading &quot;Employment/Housing” on page 11 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book is timely and easy to present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “We’ve been talking with your neighbors about what can be done to assure that there will be employment and housing for everyone. Do you believe that it is reasonable to expect that human governments will accomplish this? . . . But there is someone who knows how to solve these problems; that Is mankind’s Creator.” Read Isaiah 65:21-23. Then you could ask the householder how that sounds to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> The introduction under the heading “Injustice/Suffering” on page 12 will appeal to many today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Have you ever wondered: Does God really care about the injustice and suffering that humans experience?&quot; Allow householder to answer and then read Ecclesiastes 4:1 and Psalm 72: 12-14. If it is appropriate to feature the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book, turn to the pictures on pages 150-3 and briefly show how world conditions today are a fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Then turn to pages 161-2 to show what God has further foretold for man’s blessing. Ask the householder which aspect appeals to him most.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> After a brief discussion with the householder, you may decide that it will be more appropriate to direct his attention to an article in one of the magazines, to a brochure, or to a tract than to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For example, after using the introduction in paragraph 2 of this article, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ &quot;This brochure, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?,</span><span class="font7"> clearly explains what God has promised to do to care for our daily needs and shows how we can benefit.&quot; Turn to pages 26 and 27 of the brochure, and call attention to paragraph 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Or after using the introduction in paragraph 3, the tract Wifi </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">This World Survive?</span><span class="font7"> could be highlighted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “There is so much misery and trouble in the world today. This tract shows that war, food shortages, and health problems were all prophesied in the Bible. But God has also promised to bring about a marvelous change for mankind.&quot; Read the last paragraph on page 5 of the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Our sincere interest in people, coupled with a simple and effective presentation that touches the heart, will surely appeal to sheeplike ones. —John 10:16.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Teaching...</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Things I Have Commanded You”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Making disciples Involves teaching. Before an individual can become a disciple of Christ, he must be taught “to observe all the things” Jesus commanded. (Matt. 28:19, 20) The best way to accomplish this is through a home Bib</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">le stud</span><span class="font7">y.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Bible studies are not always easy to start. If you are having difficulty in finding a Bible study, dp not be dis-, couraged. Success in starting Bible studies requires determination and a sincere desire to impart the truth to others.—Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Developing Interest: </span><span class="font7">Your initial discussion may produce only limited interest. Depending on the circumstances, a tract, a brochure, or the magazines may be left with the householder. You may be able to use one of these to start </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">a home Bible study</span><span class="font7">. If the householder shows further interest in the message, he may be directed to another appropriate publication on a later visit_</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Preparation is the key to success. Why not select ahead of time a Scripture text that is quoted in the tract,, brochure, or magazine you plan to use on your return visit? In that way you will be able to link comments from the publication with your discussion. You may even be able to read one or two paragraphs directly from the publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might say this:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">■ “We have been sharing some information about a remarkable prophecy that is undergoing fulfillment right now.&quot; Read Matthew 24:3. then tie in the picture and the comments on page 24 of t</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">“Look!”</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font7">brochure. A similar approach may be used when presenting the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Once genuine interest has been discerned, it should be followed up promptly. Try to return within a week so that the last conversation will still be fresh in the householder’s mind. Each time you call, consider a few paragraphs from the publication that you left. Then, at an appropriate </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font7">e, you can introduce the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forevei </span><span class="font7">book, continuing the same procedure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> Today there is still much work to do in the great harvest foretold by Jesus. (Matt. 9:37, 38) As we continue to teach honesthearted ones, we have Jesus’ strengthening assurance that </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">he is ‘with us</span><span class="font7"> all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.’</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Men have made many proposals for peace and security, but none of these fulfill the real needs of people worldwide. Although religious, racial, and national </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">hatred</span><span class="font11">s, combined with political am</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">bition</span><span class="font11"> and greed, appear to be major roadblocks to&quot; a secure and peaceful world, true Christians know that the r</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">eal obstacles are Sata</span><span class="font11">n the Devi (and man’sj-efusal to submit to JehovaFTGod.—Ps. 127:1; Jer. 8:9; 1 John 5:19.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During January, we will endeavor to help our neighbors to see that </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">God’s wa</span><span class="font11">v to peace and security is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"> way</span><span class="font11"> and that Jehovah has the ultimate solution to all of mankind’s problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Use New Tracts: </span><span class="font11">We can share this upbuilding message by using the new tracts that were introduced at our “Light Bearers” District Convention. A simple demonstration showed how to use Tract NO..J.9, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?,</span><span class="font11"> to start a conversation and lead into a Bible study. The striking fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy about the end of this world should arrest the attention of many.</span></p></li>

If you learn that a householder already </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">has on</span><span class="font11">e of our publications, tactfully offer to demonstrate how it can be used in a Bible study.

Additionally, any books published by the Society in 1983 or before may be featured in the field service when people show real interest in the truth. If your congregation’ has, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Family Life, “Kingdom Come,” Truth,</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youtliibooks</span><span class="font11"> in stock, plan to make good use of them in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Genuine security can come only from the Creator. Jehovah God.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1993 “Divine Teaching” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">iAll 1,419,889 attending the 1992 “Light Bearers” District Conventions in the United States branch territory heightened their appreciation for the privilege of serving as light bearers in a bedarkened world. (2 Pet. 1:19) How thrilling it was to have 14,049 dear ones symbolize their dedication by water baptism and join the grandThrong of light bearers! To be effective, light bearers need to imitate both our Grand Instructor and the Great Teacher. We indeed have a message of “substance,” and this year’s “Divine Teaching.” District Conventions will help us to be more effective in reaching people’s hearts with this vital information. (Ps. 119:160; Matt. 28:20) Missionaries all around the globe are already making plans to attend these conventions in their home country. Are you and your family making similar plans? Why not encourage your Bible students to attend this rich spiritual feast?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Be sure to make your convention arrangements carefully and prayerfully so that you can be there to enjoy all four days of the delightful spiritual program, from the opening song to the closing prayer. Lovingly include in your plans those who may need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they also can attend every session. (Gal. 6:10) The program starts at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday and ends at approximately 5:00 p.m. On both Friday and Saturday, the program begins at 9:20 a.m. and closes with song and prayer at approximately 5:00 p.m. The Sunday morning session begins at 9:20, and the day’s program concludes at approximately 4:10 p.m. The following information will assist you with your preliminary preparations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Instructions for Obtaining Rooms: </span><span class="font13">After the Service Meeting for the week of January 4, congregations should post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list for the district convention to which the congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. Your cooperation with these arrangements will assist the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient rooming accommodations for everyone at reasonable prices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What You Should Do: </span><span class="font13">After—NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the motels, you are free to phone the motel of your choice and make reservations. Identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases are greatly reduced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list and so on. Often, everyone calls the motels closest to the convention facility being used; therefore, you may find it beneficial to try some motels farther away. These often have quality rooms at lower rates. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregations with revised lists, deleting motels that have been filled and listing additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dormitories: </span><span class="font13">A few conventions use school dormitories in addition to motels in order to accommodate everyone. Usually, congregations will receive information on these a month or so after receiving the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font13">This provision is only for exemplary publishers, including their well-behaved children, who are approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Arrangements to care for persons with special needs should be made by the congregation where they attend. Elders and others who are aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, and perhaps others. Publishers may extend help by taking such ones with them or by caring for their needs in other ways—Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Of course, the Rooming Department will endeavor to provide suitable rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs if they cannot be assisted by those in the congregation. These publishers may discuss their situation with the congregation secretary. The secretary should speak with the Congregation Service Committee to see if it is possible for the congregation to assist these individuals to care for their own rooming accommodations. If the congregation is unable to render the needed assistance, the secretary may give such persons a copy of the Special Needs Room Request form. Only those with special needs should fill out this form. It is to be filled out by the person making the request and returned to the secretary, who will check it for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that qualify the person for such consideration. The circumstances are to be explained in detail by the secretary in the space provided on the form. All of this should be done well ahead of the convention. The secretary will then forward the form to the Rooming Department. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive because the Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Private-home accommodations are set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford motel rooms but who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Neither is it proper for those making such requests to presume upon the hospitality of brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days before or after the convention. These rooms are provided for the convention period ONLY. Those receiving such accommodations should see that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host and do not rummage through or damage the host’s possessions or enter private areas of the home. If householders experience any difficulties along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the rooming overseer at the convention and he will be happy to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Delegates Attending From Outside the Assigned Area: </span><span class="font13">In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Having adequate seating, literature, food, rooming accommodations, and so forth, is based on the premise that the majority of publishers will attend the convention to which their congregation is assigned. However, if for good reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, the congregation secretary can give you the address for that convention headquarters from the list on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then you can request in writing a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Your Cooperation Needed: </span><span class="font13">The success of this rooming arrangement depends on the cooperation of all of those involved. (Heb. 13:17) Thus, we are asking everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement and USE ONLY THE MOTELS ON THE CURRENT RECOMMENDED LODGING LOCATIONS list so that major difficulties we still experience in negotiating with the motels can be prevented. Most publishers are taking to heart the clear direction that has been given in previous convention inserts, and many good results are being experienced. However, it is still necessary to request that everyone PLEASE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING MOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">(a) Do not locate and call motels in the convention city and ask them if they are on the current list or have special rates for the convention. Also, please do not use the same motel year after year without first checking to see that it is definitely on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(b) Do not accept a higher price for a motel room than what is quoted on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(c) Please do not make reservations at a motel you do not intend to use or at more than one motel with the idea of checking them, selecting the best, and canceling the others. (Matt. 5:37) This is unfair, as it prevents the motels from getting business they could have had and deprives other publishers of the use of those rooms, which are often vitally needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(d) Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and immediately sending the deposits for each room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(e) Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based upon the number of persons you agreed would be in the room.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Violations in these areas make it difficult to negotiate good rates, and they bring reproach on Jehovah’s name and organization. (Ps. 119:168) Therefore, the Society will be asking the Rooming Department to check with the motels to determine if any are experiencing such problems and who is involved. The convention organization is working hard to save our brothers as much expense as possible, so it is in the best interests of all to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement so that this provision can continue. The listing gives a choice of good-quality accommodations at motels that cooperate. With this arrangement, our aim is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so that they can enjoy the fine spiritual program at the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Sign-Language Sessions: </span><span class="font13">As you will note in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> of February 15, 1993, sign-language interpreting will be provided AT ONLY 16 specific convention cities. NO PROVISION for sign language will be made at any other conventions. This arrangement provides good-quality interpreting and larger groups for enjoyable, upbuilding fellowship. Deaf individuals should immediately make their plans to attend one of these 16 sign-language sessions. The elders should also check with each deaf person in their congregation to see if assistance is needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">[Note to Body of Elders: Please read the Society’s December 15, 1992, convention assignment letter and the first and last paragraphs of the Recommended Lodging Locations list for your congregation during the Service Meeting for the week of January 4. After that meeting, post the letter and the list on the information board. NO one, including the ELDERS, SHOULD MAKE MOTEL RESERVATIONS BEFORE THIS SERVICE MEETING. In this way all congregations will receive the information the same week. The congregation secretary should handle convention-related material and announcements on future Service Meetings.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Fine Privilege of Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> One reader said that he had learned much more of real value by reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> than he did during six years of university schooling. It is not uncommon for sincere readers to make such heartwarming expressions of appreciation after reading these magazines for just a short time. How privileged we are to share our magazines regularly with those who truly value them!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many people, although having some interest in the truth, have not progressed to the point of accepting a home Bible study. But their interest may be cultivated if someone calls back regularly with each new issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> Yes, faithfully delivering magazines on a magazine route has helped move people eventually to agree to having a regular Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We benefit personally by having a magazine route if we read the magazines first and take note of specific points that will be of particular interest to each person on our list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that it is the extent of the householder’s interest, and not the size of his donation, that determines whether you should include his name on your list of magazineroute calls. If the person shows real interest when accepting the magazines, you may explain that outstanding articles appear in our magazines every two weeks and that you will be happy to deliver them. Be sure to follow through on a regular basis, taking advantage of opportunities to converse with the householder-on Bible subjects. We know you will enjoy this fine privilege of service.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wisely Using Vital Tools</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As you witness from door to door, your goal should be to engage each householder in a constructive. Scriptural conversation by using the Bible and other vital tools. (Compare 2 Corinthians 6:1; 2 Timothy 2:15.) What are people in your territory concerned about these days? Are they worried about the economic situation and the decline in the quality of family life? A few introductory remarks on either of these topics may lead to a line Bible discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “In these challenging times, many people are finding it hard to make ends meet. Do you think human governments will solve our financial problems in a way that will be fair to everyone? [Listen to reply.) I personally found this thought to be most encouraging...”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Then you could read Psalm 72: 12-14 and round out the conversation by selecting an additional text from those found on pages 154-5 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. Or after reading one scripture, you could refer to a paragraph in the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font11"> Many publishers—including young ones—are successfully starting Bible studies in one of the tracts by reading a paragraph and then asking the householder for his opinion on what was read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> In some communities you may prefer to use this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Many people would like to see a return to traditional family values. Do you think it is up to each individual to determine what those values should be, or should there be one standard for everyone? [Allow response.) Many agree that if the Bible’s wise advice were followed, there would be a marked improvement in the quality of family life.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> At this point you may either introduce and discuss the apostle’s statement at Colossians 3:12-14 or endeavor to start a home Bible study on the initial call by using points under the subheading “Which Way to Success?&quot; in the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Family Life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If the householder manifests interest, show him the value of one of the Society’s 192-page bound books you are featuring during the month. If you are not sure of the extent of his interest, make wise use of other vital tools by sharing an appropriate point in a tract, a magazine, or a brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> If you are able to start a study on the first call, make definite arrangements to continue the discussion at a later date. You might lay the groundwork for your next visit by telling the householder that when you return you would like to share the answer to the commonly asked question: “Why does God permit suffering?” The article below will suggest how the subject may be developed on the return visit.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Build On Interest by Making Effective Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">ing came up. and I promised to return with some information for you. Many people feel that if God truly cares about us, he would put an end to suffering. Perhaps you have felt, the same way. [Allow householder to answer.) The Bible assures us that God really does care. [Read 1 John 4:8.) God has </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">good reason</span><span class="font11">s for h</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">aving allow</span><span class="font11">ed suffering to continue until now. One of those reasons is explained at 2</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">. Pete</span><span class="font11">r .</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">3:11</span><span class="font11"> [Read.] Other reasons are outlined in this brochure.&quot; Then turn to pages 1244 of theb.rochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font11"> and discuss a point of interest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Some householders may be interested in a more thorough explanation, and several return visits may be necessary before they are completely satisfied with the answer. A number of the Society's 192-page bound books that will be featured, during January include a chapter that can be used as a basis for further discussion of the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As you bring the discussion to_a close, raise, another question and tell the householder you will be happy to share some interesting information with him when you return. Many people would like to know what happens to a person at death. Why not arrange to discuss that topic at a convenient time?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It will be helpful for you to keep three basic principles in mind. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Be jleXz if/le.</span><span class="font11"> The householder may not be used to setting aside a specific time for Bible discussion. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Be brief</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font11"> Do not stay too long or cover too many points at first. In most cases, there will be a more favorable response to your visits if you cover just a few points in a short time. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Be warm and friendly</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font11">Show the householder that you are personally interested in him as an individual.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Our immediate goal is to engage the householder in a Scriptural conversation. Then we want to start a productive home Bible study in a suitable publication, such as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book. That joy may be yours if you patiently build on the initial interest by making effective return visits.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Set Aside Time for Magazine Activity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has determined that there will be ‘peace, a future, and a hope’ for those following his ways. (Jer. 29:11) Information about this prospect is presented in a timely way in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> These magazines can benefit all sorts of people under every circumstance. (1 Tim. 2:4) Do you and your family regularly set aside time for magazine distribution?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> If your magazine placements have been decreasing, how might this trend be remedied? One essential is to keep alive your appreciation for the contents of our magazines. One man wrote: “Reading your magazines is a genuinely joyful experience. They are not cheap, low-quality ‘comforters’ but contain guidance and direction on how to make life meaningful.&quot; </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> are products of careful research and are provisions of “the faithful and discreet slave.&quot; (Matt. 24:45) They are effective tools for reaching the hearts of people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Be familiar with the articles in the magazines you are offering. Look for points that deal with current problems in your community. It is good to prepare for speaking with men, women, and youths that you may meet at the doors or on the street. Be prepared to show how the magazines relate to Individuals and to families as a whole.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Magazine Conscious: </span><span class="font9">Magazine witnessing should occupy an important part of your field service schedule. What are the best times for you to offer the magazines? Have you tried working from door to door for an hour or so In the late afternoon or evening before your Congregation Book Study? Evening witnessing has been very productive in some areas. Saturday is a good day for distributing magazines in various ways, but other days may also be used for this activity. The house-to-house and store-to-store work should be a regular part of Magazine Day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Each one should have a standing order for a set number of distributors’ copies of each issue of the magazines. When on occasion you have older issues on hand, these may be used to show householders the variety of subjects covered In the magazines. From time to time, a set of older copies may be left at retirement homes, nursing homes, and hospitals where allowed. All such magazines can be counted as placements and are to be reported each month on your Field Service Report slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> By applying the above suggestions, no doubt you will see an Increase in the number of magazines you are able to distribute. Honesthearted people who are burdened down with life in the present wicked system appreciate refreshing information such as is found in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> These magazines truly provide the spiritual food needed by those seeking to gain Jehovah’s approval. Therefore, be magazine conscious, and seek out ways to Increase the distribution of these valuable publications in your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach the Heart of Your Bible Student</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Do you want your Bible student to act upon what he is learning? He must do so if he is to benefit from the knowledge he is gaining. In order to motivate your Bible student to action, you must rea</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ch hi</span><span class="font9">s heart. On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter’s stimulating discourse “stabbed to the heart” about 3,000 persons, who “embraced his word heartily” and were baptized that day. (Acts 2:37, 41) How can you reach the heart of your Bible student?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare Thoroughly: </span><span class="font9">Do not try to cover so much material that little time is available to reason with the student on the information. Determine in advance the points that you will highlight, and be certain that you understand and can apply the scriptures effectively. Consider beforehand the questions that may arise in the student’s mind because of his background. If you are well acquainted with your student, this knowledge will help you to be prepared with information that will particularly fit him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Imitate Jesus' Method of Teaching: </span><span class="font9">Jesus used illustrations to simplify difficult points and to help his students get the sense and feel the emotion of a situation. (Luke 10:29-37) Similarly, you can impress fine teachings on the heart of your Bible student by keeping your Illustrations simple, taking them from the common things of life, and applying them’specifically to the student’s circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Questions are especially helpful in reaching the hearts of Bible students, as Jesus often demonstrated. (Luke 10: 36) But do not be satisfied if the student simply reads the answer from the book. Use </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">leading</span><span class="font9"> questions to direct his mind to a conclusion that he may not have considered before. This process also helps the student to develop thinking ability. Ask </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">viewpoint</span><span class="font9"> questions to find out what he personalty believes on a matter. You may then discern areas where help is needed, and you can follow through with more specific assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If a Bible student is not making progress, you need to draw him out as to the reasons. This may Involve making a visit at a time other than the regular study period. Why is he hesitant to act? Is there some Scriptural point he does not understand? is he reluctant to make certain adjustments in his way of life? If a Bible student is trying to ‘limp upon two different opinions,’ assist him to recognize the danger in doing so.—1 Ki. 18:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> The apostle Paul realized that teaching Bible truths to interested persons is a lifesaving work, and so he counseled all Christians to ‘pay constant attention to their teaching.’ (1 Tim. 4:16) Those with whom you conduct Bible studies must take in more than just facts about the Bible and world events. They must gain accurate knowledge about Jehovah and Jesus and be helped to develop a warm personal relationship with them. Only by so doing will they be moved to demonstrate their faith by works. (Jas. 2: 17, 21, 22) When the student’s heart is reached, he will be motivated to follow the course that will honor Jehovah and safeguard his own life.—Prov. 2:20-22.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Continued Expansion Increases Need for Kingdom Halls</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">' Long ago Jehovah’s prophet foretold that “the desirable things of all the nations must come in.” (Hag. 2:7) Surely we are seeing the evidence of how divine teaching is enabling multitudes to learn the truth and become Jehovah’s worshipers. How thrilling it is to note that 41,581 were baptized during the 1993 service year in the United States alone! In order to keep assisting all these new ones, we needjo fset our hearts upon our ways’ to be sure that we are supporting God’s work to tKe fullest extent possible. (Compare Haggai 1:57 An important part of our supporting God’s work continues to be our helping to provide suitable houses of worship for throngs of new praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Society Kingdom Hall Fund has been in operation for ten years now and has made it possible for 1,863 congregations to obtain new Kingdom Hall facilities. During the 1993 service year, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">227</span><span class="font10"> congregations in 38 states received loans for Kingdom Hall construction. Gratifying, indeed, has been the response of the publishers in giving financial support to this revolving fund. Moneys lent to congregations are being returned to the fund along with accrued interest so that all funds donated continue to be used, year after year, to build new Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">'Assistance by Regional Building Commit* tees: </span><span class="font10">The 73 Regional Building Committees in the United States aid the elders involved in construction activity in connection with new Kingdom Halls and renovation projects. They help assess the need for a new Kingdom Hall or remodeling an existing hall and provide outside assistance as needed from the time before property is purchased until the Kingdom Hall is completed. Each congregation is assigned to one of these committees.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Tens of thousands of willing workers have volunteered to share in the work of renovating Kingdom Halls and building new ones. These volunteers, including many professionals and tradesmen, give freely of their time and effort in such matters as purchasing property, filing legal papers, planning the building, and developing lists of materials to be purchased. They also help with purchasing quality materials at favorable prices, completing the initial site work, and overseeing the actual construction. Such generous giving of their dedicated resources in behalf of Kingdom interests is most commendable and brings rich blessings from Jehovah.—Prov. 11:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Elders should contact the Regional Building Committee for their area when their congregation first begins considering renovation of an existing Kingdom Hall or construction of a new one. Why? The regional committees have guidelines thatTSn help congregations in their initial considerations. Selecting a site involves many factors in addition to the purchase price of the property. Other things could greatly increase the actual cost of the property, such as extensive site work, removal of hazardous or toxic substances, or legal entanglements. If a congregation needs financial assistance from the Society, the regional committees have copies of the Kingdom Hall Loan Survey form and can help congregation elders complete these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The Society has provided Regional Building Committees with suggested flon^ plaps for King- &quot;&nbsp;* dom Halls. Before selecting a design, congregation elders should co</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ntact</span><span class="font10"> the regional committee and discuss the overall layout of the building, using the Society-provided plans as a guide. Not only will this reduce development costs but it will also help the congregation to choose a building that will be modest yet functional and that will be suited for the quickly built method of construction.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Accurate and detailed financial records must be kept. Knowledgeable brothers have volunteered to work with the regional committees to aid congregations in setting up the needed accounting system and maintaining it. Other brothers working with the Regional Building Committees help congregations complete loan surveys and applications. This assists greatly, since local elders do not usually work with such Kingdom Hall financial records on a continuing basis as do these experienced and well-trained brothers. When the work is finished, the regional committee should receive a copy of the complete accounting records for the project.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup>Onlookers Impressed: </span><span class="font10">The evident operation of Jehovah’s holy spirit upon the brothers working on Kingdom Halls has served as a witness to others. The materials for one hall were purchased from a lumber company, and later the manager wrote: “I do not recall ever being more impressed with a group of people than I was with the Jehovah’s Witnesses during the project. It was both fun and exci</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ting</span><span class="font10"> for me to witness such an event, and I was glad to be able to participate in a small way. You and your people are to be commended, and I wish you much success in your future projects.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> In another instance, a representative of a supplier was assigned to spend parts of three days at the construction site. He said: “My life has been enriched by being with you this weekend. My impression of Jehovah’s Witnesses has changed! You do much more than knock on doors. It was a privilege to have had a part. Don’t be surprised to see me at your public meeting.” ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> When one project was completed, the mayor wrote on behalf of the city, stating: \ “It was an inspiration to see the hundreds of volunteers work togeffier’to build the hall </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">so quickl</span><span class="font10">y. It is indeed a beautiful building. Residents were talking about the building’s going up so quickly. The new Kingdom Hall is a true credit to our conununity, and we are proud to welcome it and your congregation.”)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> More Volunteers Needed: </span><span class="font10">The regional committees seek to use skills that are available within the congregations that will meet in the new or renovated Kingdom Halls. They also work with other local brothers, especially elders and ministerial servants, to train them in performing the tasks at hand. Having developed needed skills that will be useful in Kingdom Hall construction, these spiritually mature brothers can thereafter assist with building other Kingdom Halls within the region. Thus, those associated with the congregations involved in a Kingdom Hall construction project need to display a willing and cooperative spirit, not expecting that the regional committee and those working with it will care for all the work on their Kingdom Hall. (Neh. 4:6b) After receiving training, brothers should be motivated by love to help construct Kingdom Halls for other congregations that also have a pressing need for new or improved facilities.—Neh. 5:19; Phil. 2:3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Baptized publishers who have appropriate skills and who are in good standing in the congregation are encouraged to volunteer to assist with this vast work assignment. Both construction and nonconstruction skills are needed. Volunteers can obtain the needed forms from the presiding overseer or secretary in their congregation and indicate their experience as tradesmen or in some other field, such as food service, safety, materials handling, accounting, and the processing of legal papers. (When more volunteer forms are needed by the congregation, they may now be requested when the monthly literature request is sent to the Society.) Responding in this way is an evidence of our love for our closest neighbors—our Christian brothers—Matt. 7:12; 22: 39; John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Volunteer Assistance Appreciated: </span><span class="font10">Until becoming involved in a Kingdom Hall construction project, few realize what a huge undertaking it is. After one Kingdom Hall project was finished, the elders wrote: “The patient direction received from the brothers on the Regional Building Committee was a tremendous blessing to us. When we think of the support they gave us through both direction and coordination of skilled workers, we cannot help but call to mind 1 Peter 5:2, 3, where we read of shepherding ‘not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly; neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.’ These brothers are truly fine examples of dedicated service to Jehovah. Throughout the duration of the project, there were occasions, too numerous to count, when brothers traveled from distant places, spent long hours, donated the use of their equipment and tools, and even donated materials, all to help us in the construction of our new Kingdom Hall. The generosity of these brothers is a grand demonstration that they do ‘have love for the whole association of brothers,’ and what an encouragement that has been for us!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">—1 Pet 2:17.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> The willing spirit and zeal of the brothers is evident, as one group wrote: “What a tremendous joy it was to see the Korean-, Spanish-, and Englishspeaking congregations all working so well together in united worship of Jehovah!” True, indeed, are the words of Psalm 133:1,3: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! ” One elder working with a regional committee wrote saying what a privilege it was to serve other brothers. He commented that the “congregations are so encouraged by brothers traveling hundreds of miles to assist them in carrying out their dedication to Jehovah.... Truly, we form a loving brotherhood! ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> In appreciation of the work done on one congregation’s Kingdom Hall, the presiding overseer wrote: “Because there are so many elderly brothers in this congregation, this project could not have been accomplished by just our effort alone. So a big thanks goes to you and brothers like you who feel Jehovah’s love and who want, not just to feel it, but to show it. May we say to our brothers: ‘Keep up the good work.’ Your efforts are being felt by so many of our brothers and without doubt bring joy to our Father, Jehovah.” Another building committee wrote: “We personally know the hard work that many contributed. (Phllem. 21) Non-Witnesses in the area have exclaimed that ‘Jehovah is with you people!”’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Financial Contributions Continue to Help: </span><span class="font10">Generous contributions to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund have aided congregations in the past and will surely continue to do so in the future. Does not Jehovah God himself take the lead in unselfish giving? (Jas. 1:17) While it is true that our abilities and opportunities to give do vary, we may find that by adjusting our personal spending, we can have a full share in supporting the building work. Such liberality certainly brings joy to Jehovah’s heart, as well as great encouragement to our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> Increasingly, “a great crowd” is responding to the message of the Kingdom today. “The desirable things” are streaming into Jehovah’s spiritual temple, and he is ‘filling his house with glory.’ (Rev. 7:9; Hag. 2:7) Like faithful Jews of Haggai’s time, may we set our hearts on God’s work, fully supporting the pressing need for additional Kingdom Halls. Even though many thousands of fine Kingdom Halls have been built in recent years, growth continues at an accelerated pace. Our continued support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is an excellent means of sharing in God’s work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Every farmer knows that if he sows his seed bountifully, he will likely reap a bountiful harvest, but if he sows sparingly, he will assuredly reap sparingly. (2 Cor. 9:6) Farmers are careful not to waste seed by sowing where no growth is possible Similar discernment is needed when we offer our literature in the field. Our desire is to leave literature with those who are interested in reading it. We want to give deserving ones the opportunity to learn of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and the Kingdom hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Do you find that magazines, brochures, and other publications are accumulating on a shelf at home when they could be used to bring deserving ones in your territory to a knowledge of the truth? (Compare Matthew 25:25.) Do you sometimes hold back from offering magazines or other literature on the first call simply because you find It awkward to mention how the Kingdom preaching work is supported? Experienced publishers have found that appreciative householders respond to a simple, direct statement when they are told how donations to the Kingdom work are handled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “You may be wondering how we can offer literature without charge. It is a part of a worldwide educational work supported by voluntary contributions. If you would like to make a small donation toward the work, I would be very glad to accept it.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Many householders will ask how much the literature costs.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “There is no charge for the literature because our work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to make a small donation today, we would be happy to see that it is used in the worldwide preaching work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Or you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We make our literature available to all who are interested in learning more about the Bible. If you would like to make a small donation toward this worldwide work, I would be pleased to forward it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>i</sup>In magazine work some publishers show the inside page of a magazine and say: </span><span class="font9">■ “As you see here, our work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to make a small donation to help with this work, I am in a position to handle it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Here is another simple expression:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Although our literature is offered without charge, we do accept modest donations for our worldwide work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> We should never hold back from sowing Kingdom seed because we are reluctant to mention how the work is financed. At the same time, discernment is needed so that our literature is not wasted on ‘rocky soil.’ (Mark 4:5, 6, 16, 17) Those who appreciate the good news we bring are glad to have the opportunity to contribute to its material support. —Compare Matthew 10:42.</span></p>

[Read.] Did you notice what is promised? [Allow for response.] How can we gain everlasting life?” Read John 17:3, and highlight the need to take in knowledge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After introducing ourselves, we could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Today we’re asking our neighbors what they think when they read in their Bible about gaining everlasting life. For example, note what Jesus said at John 17:3. [Read.] To help people learn more about Jesus Christ and what he taught, this book has been published.&quot; Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man </span><span class="font9">book to some of the beautiful illustrations. Turn to the introduction, and read the second paragraph under the subheading “Benefit by Learning About Him.” If the householder is interested, offer him the publication.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If you place the book, lay the groundwork for a Bible study by offering to discuss the first chapter, “Messages From Heaven,” at that time or on a return visit a few days later. Rather than mentioning to the householder a fixed period of time that should be spent on the next visit, simply say that in just a few minutes, he can learn more interesting information about Jesus Christ from God’s Word, the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> May all of us use this worldly holiday season to focus attention on the truth about God’s Son, Jesus Christ, in order to help others onto the road to everlasting life—Matt. 7:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commanded his disciples to be teachers of the good news. (Matt. 28: 19, 20) Our primary means of teaching others is by conducting Bible studies. Are you sharing in this work? If not, how can you start a study so that you can enjoy a greater share in teaching others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps we gave the householder a tract and promised to return to discuss its contents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When calling back on a householder with whom we left the tract “Will This World Survive?,” we might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “When I was here a few days ago, we discussed the urgency of our times and that Jesus accurately described the conditions that exist in our day. I'd like to spend a few minutes and briefly consider some information from the tract that I left with you. Note what's stated under the subheading ‘The Sign.' ” Turn to page 3 of the tract, and discuss the first two or three paragraphs under that subheading, reading the cited scriptures as time permits. Highlight how Jesus' prophecy Is being fulfilled today. Arrange to return arid go over the other paragraphs under this subheading. Encourage the householder to read the material before you return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Or you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “The last time that we talked, I left you the tract entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font9"> At that time we talked about the role of Jesus Christ In world affairs. We read his words recorded in the Bible at John 17:3. [Read.] Since it’s essential that we learn about God and Jesus if we want everlasting life, it’s worth our while to do what we can to take in such knowledge. When Jesus was on earth, he reflected the many wonderful qualities of God. Isn’t it reasonable to believe that the more we come to know about Jesus and his ministry, the more we come to know about his Father? [Allow for response.] Notice what this book. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </span><span class="font9">says.&quot; Read the first and second paragraphs on the tenth page of chapter 116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Emphasize that this book contains all the Information in the four Gospel accounts about Jesus and puts this material in the order the events occurred. Point out specific chapter titles, illustrations, and the map at the beginning of the book. If the person is genuinely interested, offer the publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'After greeting a householder who accepted the “Greatest Man” book, we might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “As I mentioned on my previous visit, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font9"> book is designed for Bible study, rd like to demonstrate briefly how it can be most effectively used.” Open the book to chapter 1, &quot;Messages From Heaven.” Draw the householder's attention to the printed questions. Read the first question, then consider the opening paragraphs. Tie in the illustration on the second page. Take up the remaining questions, and highlight the answers as time allows. Before concluding the call, arrange to return and continue the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> By maintaining a positive attitude, preparing well, and taking advantage of every opportunity, we will be well equipped to start a Bible study during December.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist David asked: “O Jehovah. who will be a guest in your tent? Who willreside in yourHoly mountain?&quot; With a few. well-chosen words. David answered: &quot;He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth.&quot;.(Ps<sub>;</sub> 15:1, 2) Those requirements have not changed. All today who come to worship in the Christian congregation must abandon im-_ moral practices and drunkenness. There is no place among Jehovah’s people for those who are quarrelsome, have violent tempers, or are double-tongued. Whether new ministers or seasoned ones, we must </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">be faithfu</span><span class="font10">l in maintaining the high standards outlined in God’s Word.—Gal. 5:19-21.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Many new ones are associating with Jehovah’s organization.

Through a Bible study, he broke </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">off</span><span class="font10"> association with his previous companions, found new friends among Jehovah’s Witnesses, and eventually dedicated his life to God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Earnestly Search for Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There is increasing evidence that time is running out for this old world. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) What does this mean? It means that the lives of people are at stake. However, it is within our power to help some get saved. (Prov. 3:27) To this end we should earnestly endeavor to start and conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Much good has been accomplished by the distribution of our Bible-based literature. But what people need most is personal assistance through a regularly conducted home Bible study. How can we help them see that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We can raise questions that concern many people. Such questions could focus on why morals have drastically declined, why family life is so unstable, why violence and crime are such a threat, why a loving God permits present conditions, and so forth. Be alert to issues and events that are of particular interest to people in your territory. Point to the Bible's clear answers to these questions. Show how the literature we distribute can help them to learn what the Bible has to say about these and other vital issues that affect all of us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ It is important to draw the householder into the conversation. Be alert to discern what concerns him. Develop your conversation around his interests or anxieties. Call attention to information in a book, brochure, magazine, or tract that explains the Bible’s solution to mankind’s problems. Before leaving, raise a question or two that you believe will build his anticipation for your next call. When you return, be sure to remind him of these questions, and then use the literature in helping him to find the Bible’s answers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Our starting studies and regularly conducting them can change the lives of people. We need to show genuine interest in the concerns of those we meet in the field or in informal settings. It takes good preparation to stimulate their interest progressively. It takes patience to keep calling back until you get them into a regular pattern of spiritual feeding. It takes loving interest in the people themselves. We must sincerely want to help them to be saved from impending destruction. Our Bible study work should be made a matter of regular and earnest prayer.—1 Thess. 5:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> It is most encouraging to see that nearly a million people have become baptized disciples in the past three years. (Matt. 28:19, 20) We are now conducting about four and a half million Bible studies each month, and this shows ourconcemfor the lives of others. What about you? Have you been putting forth earnest effort to share in the home Bible study work? Remember, our lives and those of others depend upon our faithfulness in this regard.—Ezek. 3: 17-19.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Evidence abounds that we are now living in “the last days.&quot; (2 Tim. 3:1) Without a doubt the time left for Kingdom preaching and disciple making is reduced. Each of us. therefore, should act with urgency to help others become approved worshipers of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul felt his responsibility to make public declaration of his faith. (Rom. 10:10) He knew that God’s “will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.&quot; (1 Tim. 2:4) Based on his knowledge of truth. Paul considered himself to be a debtor to all. This increased his sense of urgency in declaring the good news. He said: “There is eagerness on my part to declare the good news . . . For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is. in fact, God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith.”—Rom. 1:14-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do we personally feel this same indebtedness and manifest a similar eagerness to reach everyone in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">our </span><span class="font10">territory? While we prefer sharing the good news with others face-to-face, as in door-to-door and street witnessing, why limit our activity to this? It is possible that many individuals in our congregation territory have never spoken with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. How can this be?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Unworked Territory: </span><span class="font10">Does your territory have high-rise apartments guarded by doormen? Perhaps there are high-security apartment complexes that are off-limits to door-to-door visitation. Has the congregation been denied entry to preach the good news in a military base or a private subdivision located in the territory? Very likely some individuals living in such places have never heard about the blessings of God’s Kingdom. Are there people who are never found at home?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> We need not despair of reaching these people because they are difficult to contact. How does Jehovah view the situation? The apostle Peter writes: “Jehovah... does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.... Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation.” (2 Pet. 3:9, 15) Lives are involved, and Jehovah is interested in each one. (Matt. 18:14) How can we show the kind of compassion and mercy that Jehovah displays for these individuals? By seeing that everyone in our territory receives a witness.—Acts 20:20, 21; Rev. 14; 6.7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Organized for Thorough Activity: </span><span class="font10">In the past the Society has encouraged those who are confined to their homes, either temporarily or permanently because of illness or physical disability, to make good use of the telephone. Those who find themselves in such a situation should continue this fine work. Also, reports have been received that a number of brothers and sisters, including regular and auxiliary pioneers, have used telephone witnessing as an adjunct to their usual door-to-door ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Some congregations have made a concerted effort to arrange for telephone witnessing. When elders take the lead in organizing the territories and providing support either personally or through other publishers, greater success is reported. The service overseer is responsible for supervising this activity. However, any qualified elder or responsible ministerial servant may be selected by the body of elders to work closely with the service overseer in organizing the work.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Publishers who have overcome their initial reluctance and have gained experience in telephone witnessing have found it to be a productive field. At the outset, perhaps only a few publishers and pioneers will make these calls. After they become familiar and comfortable with this type of witnessing, their enthusiasm and encouraging experiences may move others to learn how to share in this interesting aspect of the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Where to Begin: </span><span class="font10">It may be possible to get names of residents from the directory in the lobby of an apartment building. Then the telephone numbers may be looked up in the telephone directory. A city directory in the local library may list the names of occupants of every home and apartment in the community. In some communities a special book that lists telephone numbers by street locations is available. Photocopies of pages from the latest edition could serve as territories. The size of these territories should be kept relatively small.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> In all forms of witnessing activity, it is most beneficial to keep accurate records. This is also true for telephone witnessing. Carefully note helpful information on a house-to-house record, such as the subject discussed, the interests of the householder, and the subject that will be discussed on the next call. Indicate whether another telephone call should be made at a later date or a personal visit has been arranged.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; Personal Schedule Needed: </span><span class="font10">A regular routine will help build your confidence and ward off apprehension. It is best to call when people are more likely to be home, such as in the evening and on the weekends. Schedule a regular time each week to make these calls. Some have found the hour before the Congregation Book Study to be a productive time. Find out what works best in your area.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font10">Talk with others who enjoy this privilege of service and get ideas. Always be positive. Look to Jehovah as your source of power and strength, and seek his direction through prayer. (Ps. 27:14; Phil. 4:13) Plan to put your whole heart into this activity, just as in other forms of witnessing.—Compare Mark 12:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> Experience has proved that sitting at a desk or a table can be helpful. Sitting in an upright chair promotes clear thinking and concentration. Lay out all the witnessing materials that you may use—tracts, the literature currently being featured, the latest magazines or some interesting older copies, the Bible, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, an invitation to the meetings with specific meeting times and Kingdom Hall address listed, a pen or a pencil, and house-to-house records. Have your literature readily available, perhaps even open to a particular article. Thoroughly rehearse your presentation. Keep in mind that the purpose of your call is to give a witness and to arrange a visit with the individual as soon as possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“ Making the Actual Call: </span><span class="font10">Relax. Be yourself. A warm, pleasing voice is needed for effective telephone witnessing. The smile on your face will be reflected in your tone of voice. Speak slowly and clearly, using sufficient volume. Be courteous, patient, and friendly. Do not fear rejection. Accept the fact that people may not be interested in your message. View it the same as you would in your regular door-to-door ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1S</sup> In your introduction, state your full name. It is best not to say that you are phoning all the people in a particular building or complex, as this may result in raising barriers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Many Introductions from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book may be read word for word in a conversational manner. For example, you might introduce yourself this way: “Hello, my name is__I am calling you because I am unable to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">come and see you personally.” Then, without pausing, say: “I am interested in getting your view on whether the quality of life will ever improve. Most of us are glad to be alive, but many wonder, ‘Is a genuinely happy life possible?’ How do you feel about that? [Allow time for answer.] What would you say is one of the biggest obstacles to happiness today?” Or after introducing yourself as above, you could say: “I am involved in an international volunteer work, and I would like your thoughts on the meaning of life. As we get up in years, we realize that life is very short. Is this all that life is meant to be? How do you feel about It?&quot; (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, page 13, subheading “Life/Happiness.”) A review of the suggestions in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry of</span><span class="font10"> July 1990, page 4, with regard to using introductions and avoiding objections faced in telephone witnessing will provide further helpful information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> Use the Bible early in the discussion. At some point in the conversation, when it seems appropriate to do so, mention that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Allow the householder to share in the conversation. Do not be afraid to listen if the person wants to share what he thinks. Thank him for his expressions and observations. Be ready to commend. However, if the individual begins to dominate the conversation or argue, tactfully terminate the call. Let God’s spirit direct your efforts and help you search for those whose hearts are right toward him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> It is better for you to bring the conversation to a close than to leave it to the householder to do so. You can conclude simply by inviting the person to the public talk at the Kingdom Hall, giving the address and meeting times. You may also ask if a visit may be made to his home to speak with him further on the subject discussed. It may even be possible to present literature effectively over the telephone. Magazines may be offered with the goal of starting a magazine route.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Share in the Joy of Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font10">Will all the calls become Bible studies? No, but some will. For example, one sister made over 300 calls in one month. After introducing herself, she explained why she was telephoning rather than visiting each householder. She then gave a short presentation. This resulted In 12 good calls. She is still contacting three interested persons by telephone, and four others agreed that she could visit them at their homes. One individual accepted the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book and is now being visited regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>20</sup> Jesus Christ commanded his disciples to push the witnessing work to “the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) In some areas, carrying out this command means witnessing by telephone. After reviewing the above material, ask yourself: 'Can I do more in my congregation territory to preach the good news to “all sorts of men,” Including those who are living in areas never before reached?’ Brothers who have followed these suggestions have been greatly encouraged by the results. They have found telephone witnessing to be an exceptional way to ’glorify their ministry.’ (Rom. 11:13) May you experience this same joy through telephone witnessing.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Whole-Souled in Your Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As Jesus' disciples, we have been assigned to preach the good news about God’s Kingdom and to make disciples of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) There is no other work on this earth that compares in urgency or Importance. The lives of millions of people are involved. It deserves our very best effort. Paul’s admonition well applies: “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah.” (Col. 3:23) “Whole-souled” is defined as having “ardent enthusiasm or single-minded devotion.” Are you whole-souled in your service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What does being whole-souled require of us? Jehovah referred to acceptable service as a tithe, or tenth part. (Mal. 3:10) Rather than designating a specific amount, the tenth part represents the time and effort we devote to Jehovah's service as an expression of our love for him and In recognition of our dedication to him. (w92 12/1 p. 15) Our activity should reflect the depth of our devotion and love for Jehovah. A person who is whole-souled feels impelled to serve Jehovah as fully as possible to the extent his health and circumstances allow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Paul spoke highly of Christians “working hard and exerting&quot; themselves on the basis of hope. (1 Tim. 4:10) They are rewarded with Jehovah's blessing, which 'makes them rich.’ (Prov. 10:22) In contrast, those who give in a sparing or grudging manner fall to experience the happiness that comes with giving. (Acts 20:35) Neglecting to give our best actually robs Jehovah of “the tenth parts” due him—Mal. 3:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Giving Our Best: </span><span class="font10">When we share in field service and turn in our report, is the report accurate? The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry </span><span class="font10">book, page 104, states: “Your field service time should start when you begin your witness work and end when you finish your last call in each witnessing period. Time taken for refreshments or meals during a period of field service Is not to be counted.” Good planning and effort are needed to accomplish the most during the time we are in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Giving our best means that we do as much as we can when we share in service. One who is whole-souled would not purposely limit his preaching to occasional attempts at informal witnessing rather than sharing in the door-to-door work. A whole-souled. youthful, unbaptized publisher would not go out preaching only at the insistence of his parents, demonstrating little interest in going to the doors or sharing in giving the presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Paul urges us to maintain our In-dustrlousness in order not to become sluggish. (Heb. 6:11,12) What a Joy to be able to review our personal service and have no reason to be ashamed —because we have been whole-souled! (2 Tim. 2:15) Our greatest Joy will be realized when we see among the survivors of the great tribulation those individuals we have personally assisted. To be sure,'Jehovah richly rewards those who serve him whole-souled.</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Strive to Get a Listening Ear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">' Many people we meet in our house-to-house ministry do not have spiritual matters on their minds. They may be preoccupied with family members, economic difficulties, or personal problems. To start a conversation, it is often best to talk about matters of interest common to many in the neighborhood. Questions can be used to stimulate interest, since this involves the householder in the conversation. Viewpoint questions that do not embarrass people are most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You might get a listening ear by using an approach something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Good morning. My name is__I live</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in the neighborhood. Many I’ve talked to this morning are concerned about [mention a recent neighborhood news event or matter of local concern J. Do you think God intended the world to be like this?&quot; Allow for a response. At this point the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font10"> may be featured. Briefly consider the illustration on page 1 and the information in paragraphs 1-3 as time permits. If interest is established, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book may be introduced. You could draw attention to Psalm 37:9, 10 as quoted on page 157 and read it from the book. Using artwork on pages 156-7, explain the righteous conditions that will exist earth wide when wickedness is gone.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Always be prepared to offer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> People everywhere are alarmed at the breakdown in morals. As you read the August 8 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> pick out a few points you feel would arouse interest among people in your territory. Without dwelling at length on current bad conditions, call the householder’s attention to the article “The Perfect Moral Guide,” and speak positively about the benefits of adhering to the counsel of God's Word. Later in the month, when introducing the August 22 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> call attention to the article “When All Races Live Together in Peace.” Highlight the Bible’s counsel for attaining peaceful race relations. Current as well as older issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> may be featured at any time in addition to special days set aside for offering magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Remember that our objective is to arouse interest in the Kingdom message. In order to get a listening ear. we must first get the householder’s attention and stimulate his thinking. This will cause sheeplike people to want to “hear what the true God Jehovah will speak” regarding his purpose for mankind.—Ps. 85:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Return to Help People Learn How They Can Live Forever</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■Since the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book was released, more than 65 million copies have been produced in 115 languages. Many who are now servants of Jehovah learned the basic truths of the Bible by means of this fine instrument. This month and next, we may have opportunity to place this Bible study aid, or we may meet people in the territory who already have it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Calling Back on Those Who Have the Book: </span><span class="font10">Some publishers have had good results from calling attention to the table of contents and asking the interested person which subject he finds of particular interest When the householder has selected a subject, suggest that he read over the chapter in the book before the next visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When at all possible, we should make a definite appointment to call back. Before returning we want to prepare to discuss a few paragraphs of the chapter the householder selected. If he did not have a preference, we can start discussing chapter 1. After considering a few paragraphs, we should raise a question that will be covered in the next few paragraphs. That will serve as a stepping-stone to another return visit, when we can continue the study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Of course, if the householder has questions, it is best to take those into consideration first. Most likely his questions are answered in the book. By our being familiar with the contents of the book, we may be able to turn to the appropriate paragraphs and use that material to answer the questions raised.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Calling Back on Those With Whom We Left a Tract: </span><span class="font10">Perhaps we left with the householder a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Peaceful New World</span><span class="font10"> tract. When calling back, we can discuss the opening paragraphs of the tract.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If the householder shows real interest, when we come to the end of the first paragraph on page 3, where Psalm 37:29 is quoted, we might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Those words highlight what is discussed in this publication, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font10"> Notice the thought here in paragraph 3 of chapter 1 under the heading ‘Why We Can Believe.’&quot; We can then read paragraph 3, ask the printed question on it, and continue with paragraphs 4 and 5 in the same manner. Then we could say: “Why are conditions so out of harmony with God’s purposes now? The next few paragraphs explain that, and I would like to return next week at this same time and answer that question for you.&quot; If the householder has shown real interest, we might want to offer the book at this point. Or we may decide to do so at the end of our next discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> To offer the “Live Forever” book, we could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I’m sure you’d enjoy having your own copy of this publication. Then you’d be able to read ahead and thus get more out of our next discussion.&quot; If the householder agrees to take the book, we may want to say: “This work is supported by voluntary donations. If you would like to contribute to the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you may do so.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Returning to help people learn how they can live forever is a very important work. Jesus instructed his followers to teach others what they had been taught. We pray for Jehovah to send out more workers. So then, let us do our part in finding interested ones and teaching them to be fellow workers in the harvest.—Matt. 9:37; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>

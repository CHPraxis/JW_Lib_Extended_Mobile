<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Do You Reason From</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A seasoned soldier going to war will be fully armed and protected. A skilled craftsman preparing to work on a major building project will carry the tools he needs to complete the task. A servant of Jehovah engaging in the field ministry will have his “sword&quot; in hand and will wield it skillfully whenever he has the opportunity. (Eph. 6:17) Is this true of you personally? When you share in the service, do you let God’s Word speak so that holy spirit can touch the hearts of your listeners?—Prov. 8:1, 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Preaching is not always an easy task. In some territories people are seldom at home, and those who do answer the door are often busy, offering little opportunity for extensive Bible discussions. Since the Bible is our principal textbook, how can we use it more in the service and allow its inspired message to influence our hearers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> At Every Opportunity: </span><span class="font8">At every door, we would like to use the Bible to</span></p></li></ul>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>criptures</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">motivate the householder. We must be prepared to do this regardless of the publication being offered. If the person is busy and there is insufficient time to open the Bible and read a verse or two, can you quote or paraphrase a scripture before offering literature? That alone may cause the person to stop and listen.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* For example, if you are featuring the December 8,1993, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> with the article “A World Without Disease.” after pointing to the illustration on the cover. raise the question, “Do you believe there will ever be an end to disease, a time when everyone will enjoy vibrant health?&quot; Whatever the response, you may be able to read directly from your Bible or paraphrase a scripture, such as Isaiah 33:24 or Revelation 21:4. In this way you let God’s Word do the talking.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> On Return Visits: </span><span class="font8">We should prepare before making return visits. Frequently, however, subjects that we have not prepared to discuss will arise. This is when </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures </span><span class="font8">can prove to be a valuable tool Our quoting or reading the supporting scriptures from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book will help people see that we are minis-ters_of God and not peddlers of the Word.—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> When calling back where no specific subject had been discussed, you might simply open the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book to an appropriate subject, such as “Jesus Christ,&quot; “Last Days,&quot; or “Resurrection,” and use one of the subheadings to initiate the discussion. Householders may be invited to read some of the scriptures from their own Bible. In that way the Bible will come alive to them, and Jehovah’s holy spirit will flow if they are righteously disposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’Our responsibility to preach the good news and warn the wicked is a serious one. It is Jehovah’s message, not ours. Let his Word, the sword of the spirit, help you.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Help Bible Students I for Their Study</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Bible students who prepare for their study each week demonstrate a genuine interest in the study and usually make more rapid spiritual progress than those who do not prepare. Sometimes a student may not prepare because he does not know how. It may be necessary to teach him how to prepare. How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’From the very beginning, take a little time to make sure the student understands that preparation involves personal study. Many people, although able to read, have not been taught how to study. Pages 33-43 in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font8"> provide many helpful suggestions that you may be able to pass along to the student as needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">'Show the Student the Value of Study: </span><span class="font8">You might show the student your study book in which you have marked or underlined key words and phrases. Let him see how glancing at the marked portions can remind him of thoughts that he will be able to express in his own words. Thus he will not be tempted to read whole portions from the book when answering questions. Proper training at this stage will help him to make meaningful comments later on in congregation meetings. His comments will reflect appreciation for the material being considered and indicate the depth of his understanding.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Teach Him to Use the Bible: </span><span class="font8">The student needs to learn how to locate the scripture texts referred to in the study material. When he is able to do this efficiently, he will appreciate more fully that he is indeed a student of the Bible. Although he may at first need to make use of the listing of Bible books in the front of the Bible, the student should be encouraged to become familiar with the sequence of the 66 Bible books. When he looks up and reads a scripture text, help him to identify the portion that supports the point being made in the paragraph under consideration and not to be distracted by portions that do not directly relate to the present study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> As the student progresses, encourage him to read the Bible from beginning to end. Emphasize that the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God and that true Christians must be spiritually nourished by it.—Matt. 4:4; 2 Tim. 3: 16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Introduce Other Theocratic References: </span><span class="font8">When the student has advanced sufficiently, he can begin to use other theocratic references. With discernment, encourage him to look up additional information in the publications of the Society that he will become acquainted with as he attends congregation meetings. Teach him how to use special features of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font8"> such as “Bible Words Indexed.&quot; As he starts building his own theocratic library, show him how to use the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Comprehensive Concordance, Reasoning From the Scriptures,</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Index, </span><span class="font8">and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Insight</span><span class="font8"> volumes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> If we teach Bible students how to prepare for their Bible study, we will equip them to continue progressing in the truth as capable Bible students even after their personal home Bible study has ended.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When one uses strength and vigor of youth in the right way, life can be truly delightful. Wise King Solomon wrote: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart do you good in the days of your young manhood.” (Eccl. 1T9) You young people are accountable to God for your actions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How you live your life makes a difference not only to you but also to your parents. Proverbs 10:1 states: “A wise son is the one that makes a father rejoice, and a stupid son is the grief of his mother.” But even more important, how you live your life affects your Creator, Jehovah God. That is why Proverbs 27:11 also encourages young ones: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me., How can you young ones make Jehovah’s heart rejoice today? This may be accomplished in a number of ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Proper Example: </span><span class="font9">You young people experience the “critical times hard to deal with” foretold in God’s Word. (2 Tim. 3:1) You may also be subjected to pressures from unbelieving schoolmates and even from teachers who may deride your Bible-based viewpoints. For instance, one teacher presented the evolution theory as fact and the Bible as myth. However, a young publisher in that class loyally defended the Bible. As a result, a number of Bible studies were started. Some interested ones began attending meetings. The faith of you young brothers and sisters condemns the ungodly world and attracts honesthearted ones to the truth.—Compare Hebrews 11:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Can you encourage your peers in the congregation so that they do not yield to what is bad? By setting a good example in school, at home, and in the congregation, you can strengthen the faith of other young publishers. (Rom. 1:12) Make Jehovah’s heart rejoice by setting an example for others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> By Dress and Grooming: </span><span class="font9">One young sister was teased and ridiculed because of her modest dress and was labeled an “untouchable.” This did not intimidate her into conforming to the world’s ungodly standards. Instead, she explained that she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and the high standard of the Witnesses is what she kept. Do you have such fortitude? Or do you allow Satan’s world to mold you into its way of thinking and conduct? What a pleasure to observe many of you young ones heeding Jehovah’s teaching and rejecting the sloppy styles, fads, idols, and teachings of the world. Really, as we learned at our recent district convention, we must recognize that those things that originate with the world are influenced by the demons!—1 Tim. 4:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> By Choice of Entertainment and Recre-at ion: </span><span class="font9">Parents need to keep in mind the necessity of helping their children wisely choose the right kind of entertainment and recreation. One brother spoke highly of a fine family he had grown to love very much. Being spiritually minded, the parents provided guidance that carried over into family recreation. The brother observed: ‘I admire their doing things together. Not only do the parents help the children prepare for service, but when it’s time for recreation, they have fun going on hikes, visiting museums, or just staying home and playing or working on projects. Their love for one another and for others makes you feel confident that they will walk in the truth in the future, come what may.’)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Of course, there are times when it is not possible for the entire family to engage in recreation and entertainment. You young folks need to be aware of this and the seriousness of choosing how you will spend some of your leisure time. Satan is determined to mislead as many as possible. The young and inexperienced are especially vulnerable to his crafty acts and deceptive persuasion. (2 Cor. 11:3; Eph. 6:11) So today Satan uses a variety of means to induce you to get sidetracked and pursue a life of selfish pleasure-seeking and unrighteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Television is a master seducer that promotes a materialistic and immoral life-style. Movies and videos regularly feature violence and explicit sex. Popular music has become increasingly debased and obscene. Satan’s enticements may appear Innocent, yet they have ensnared thousands of Christian youths into wrong thinking and conduct. To resist such pressures, you must vigorously pursue righteousness. (2 Tim. 2:22) If adjustments are needed in your thinking or conduct with regard to entertainment and recreation, how can these be made? The psalmist gives the answer: “With my whole heart I have searched for you. Do not cause me to go astray from your commandments.”—Ps. 119:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> The idolizing of sports and entertainment stars is common. Fear of Jehovah will help you to keep from idolizing imperfect humans. Even sexual immorality is idolized today by many. You can guard against this tendency by avoiding pornography and corrupting music. Regarding music, the April 15, 1993, issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> observed: “Music is a divine gift. For many, though, it becomes an unhealthy preoccupation. . . . Make it your aim to keep music in its place and let the activity of Jehovah be your main concern. Be selective and careful about the music you choose. Thus you will be able to use—not abuse—this divine gift.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Cultivate a complete abhorrence of what is bad. (Ps. 97:10) When tempted to do bad, think of how Jehovah views the matter, and consider the consequences: unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, emotional devastation, loss of self-respect, and loss of privileges in the congregation. Avoid exposing yourself to TV shows, movies, videos, songs, or conversations that encourage wickedness. Avoid associating with those whom the Bible classifies as “stupid ones.” (Prov. 13:19) Be selective; choose for close association those in the congregation who love Jehovah and his righteous standards.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Yes, youths who truly want to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice will heed the good counsel found at Ephesians 5:15, 16: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.&quot; What will help you keep “strict watch” on your progress in these last days?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Caring for Spiritual Needs: </span><span class="font9">At Matthew 5:3, Jesus commented: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” You too can be happy by being conscious of your spiritual need. Filling that need includes a zealous share in preaching the good news, since this builds our faith in the things we are learning.—Rom. 10:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> From personal experience you know that it is not always easy to share regularly in the ministry. Much of this may be due to a lack of confidence. Thus, firm determination on your part is necessary. By sharing in the ministry on a regular basis, you will enhance your witnessing skills and build confidence in your ability to preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> Make arrangements to work with the more experienced publishers in the congregation, such as the regular pioneers and the elders. Listen intently to their presentations and how they handle objections at the door. Make good use of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book and the suggestions presented in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> Before long you will derive even greater joy from the ministry because you are giving your all to Jehovah.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> Some have been able to take advantage of opportunities to witness at school and have been quite successful in making disciples. (Matt. 28: 19,20) One Christian youth says: “During free class periods, I had many opportunities to witness, especially around holiday time. When I left Bible publications on my desk where others could see them, many interested students approached me.” Eventually, a number of the students and even the teacher began attending Christian meetings. In fact, the teacher has progressed to the point of becoming a dedicated Witness. Jehovah rejoices greatly when young worshipers like you bring praise to his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> Another way to satisfy your spiritual need is through personal study. To make Jehovah’s heart rejoice, we must take in knowledge of him, his purposes, and his requirements for us. Do you set aside time for personal study? Do you study regularly, just as you take time to eat regularly? (John 17:3) Do you have a personal schedule for reading the Bible in addition to trying to keep up with the Bible reading schedule for the Theocratic Ministry School? Do you prepare well for all the meetings? Do you read the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines regularly? In particular, do you take the time to read each article in the “Young People Ask ...” series, carefully looking up each scripture? And do not forget the book that the Society has designed especially for your spiritual needs, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. </span><span class="font9">Christian youths and their parents the world over have written to say how this book has helped them to draw closer to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>17</sup> When you read the Bible and theocratic Bible study aids, they tell you about Jehovah, his thinking, and his purposes. Consider how this information would be helpful to you. Relate what you are reading to what you have read previously. This involves meditation. Meditation allows the information to reach the heart and motivate you.—Ps. 77:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> We rejoice to see young ones who are conscious of their spiritual need attending the congregation meetings. You Christian youths can encourage others by regularly offering meaningful comments during the meetings. Make it a goal to give at least one comment at every meeting. Cultivate warm relationships with people of all age groups in the congregation by sharing in upbuilding association before and after the meetings. (Heb. 10: 24, 25) One young brother commented that his parents encouraged him to hold a conversation with at least one older brother or sister at every meeting. Today he values the experience he has gained by associating with the older members of the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> Pursue Spiritual Goals: </span><span class="font9">It is sad that the lives of many youths lack purpose and direction. However, is it not good to experience the feeling that comes from setting theocratic goals and then successfully achieving them? These goals, pursued with the enlightenment of divine education, will be personally satisfying now and will ultimately lead to eternal salvation.—Eccl. 12:1,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>20</sup> When setting goals, make it a matter of prayer. Speak with your parents and the elders. Examine yourself and your abilities, and set practical goals according to what you are able to accomplish and not in comparison with someone else. Everyone is different in makeup—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Therefore, do not expect to accomplish everything someone else does.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>21</sup> What are some goals that you can reach for? If you are not yet a publisher or are not yet baptized, why not make these your goals. If you are a publisher, you could make a goal of putting a certain amount of time in the ministry each week. Work at becoming a capable teacher on return visits, and make it your goal to conduct a Bible study. If you are a baptized youth in school, why not make it your goal to auxiliary pioneer during the summer months? There is “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.&quot;—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">— Assistance From Parents Vital: </span><span class="font9">Youths in the congregation should never feel that they are alone in their endeavors to gain life. Jehovah, through his organization, has provided counsel to assist these young ones with making everyday decisions and overcoming obstacles in life. Dedicated parents, of course, have the primary responsibility to help their children to make proper decisions. At 1 Corinthians 11:3, the Bible designates the husband as the head of the household. Therefore, in a Christian household, with the wife working closely with him, the father takes the lead in teaching the children God’s commandments. (Eph. 6:4) This is done through conscientious training that begins in infancy. Since a child’s brain triples in size during the first year of life, parents should never underestimate their infant’s ability to learn. (2 Tim. 3:15) As children grow, parents need progressively to teach them to love Jehovah and to cultivate a good relationship with him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>23</sup> At the “Divine Teaching” District Convention, there was a talk given entitled “Work Hard for the Salvation of Your Household.&quot; Various points were shared helping parents see the practical ways they can assist their children. A good parental example is the best place to start. This will do more in helping your children spiritually than speaking volumes to them about what they should or should not do. Setting the proper parental example would include exhibiting the fruitage of the spirit within the home, toward your spouse and toward your children. (Gal. 5:22, 23) Many have seen from experience that God’s spirit is a powerful influence for good. It can help you to mold the minds and hearts of your children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>24</sup> Also mentioned at the convention was the need for parents to set a good example in personal study habits, meeting attendance, and regular participation in the field ministry. If you enthusiastically talk about the truth at home, take a zealous lead in the ministry, and are positive about personal study, your children will be encouraged to take a sincere interest in spiritual matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>25</sup> When thoughtfully prepared, a regular, meaningful family Bible study can be interesting and enjoyable, a time of reassuring family togetherness. Take the time to reach the heart of your children. (Prov. 23:15) While many families use this occasion to prepare for the weekly </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Walchtower </span><span class="font9">Study, from time to time it may be encouraging to consider a particular need of the family. Asking viewpoint questions and listening to the comments of each family member will be enlightening as well as refreshing. Conducting a study that benefits each member of the family is a real challenge for the family head. But how rewarding when all grow spiritually! When everyone is kept involved, a happy spirit prevails.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>26</sup> Your loving, specialized training now is vital for saving the lives of your offspring. (Prov. 22:6) With this in mind, it is easy to understand that this may be the most important teaching you will ever do. Never think that you are all alone in this special and important task. Learn to rely heavily on Jehovah for guidance in caring for your family responsibilities. That is not all. There are others who can be of much assistance as well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> What Others Can Do to Help: </span><span class="font9">Elders can include young people, along with their parents, in cleaning the Kingdom Hall. Encourage the children at congregation meetings. Elders and ministerial servants assigned Service Meeting parts should watch for little hands that are raised when there are parts for audience participation. Look for opportunities to use exemplary young ones in demonstrations with their parents. Some may be interviewed and make brief comments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>28</sup> Do not take their efforts for granted. Young people have proved to be a real asset to the congregation. By their fine conduct, many have ‘adorned the teaching of our Savior, God.' (Titus 2:6-10) Be conscious of the need to commend young ones who participate in even a small way. This encourages them to prepare and have the desire to do it again in the future. Such interest cannot be appraised; it is priceless. How often have you as an elder or a ministerial servant approached younger members of the congregation to commend them for a talk or a presentation on the meeting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>29</sup> Pioneers, what can you do to help? Why not review your schedule to see how to involve schoolchildren in your arrangements for afternoons and weekends? Do you talk positively about your choice of full-time service? Are you showing by your countenance that you find joy in your ministry? Do you readily recommend it to others, especially younger ones? When working from door to door, is your speech upbuilding and positive? If so, then as a pioneer you too are sharing in this all-important training activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>30</sup> All in the congregation should be keenly aware of this important work of training young ones. Can you make definite arrangements to work in the field ministry with them? Can you practice a presentation with them in preparation for the door-to-door work? Are you cognizant of opportunities to encourage future spiritual activities when working in the ministry together? Each publisher should be aware that even a small comment can generate positive thoughts toward lifelong spiritual goals, to the young person’s everlasting benefit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> Young People Can Help Themselves: </span><span class="font9">Youths, we encourage each of you to keep heeding Jehovah’s teachings and reject what is offered by the world. Continually test yourself by examining your conduct and inner feelings. What is your attitude toward Jehovah and what he expects of you in everyday living? Are you putting up a hard fight against the Influence of Satan’s ideas? (1 Tim. 6:12) Since humans, and youths in particular, naturally desire the approval of their peers, do you find yourself enticed to follow the crowd in doing what is bad? (Ex. 23:2) The apostle Paul understood that there is great pressure to conform to the world’s ways.—Rom. 7:21-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>32</sup> It takes courage to resist the world’s influence, to take a course different from worldly peers, and to heed the teachings of God. Men of old did so with much success. Consider the courage of Noah. He condemned an entire world through his faith and by keeping separate from the wrongdoers of his time. (Heb. 11:7) Put up a hard fight because it is worth the effort. Do not imitate the weak, spineless, fearful ones who follow Satan’s crowd. On the contrary, seek out the association of those who are finding favor in Jehovah’s eyes. (Phil. 3:17) Surround yourself with associates who will march side by side with you into God’s promised new world. (Phil. 1:27) Keep in mind that there is only one way that leads to everlasting life.—Matt. 7:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>33</sup> If we find joy in seeing youths bring praise and honor to our God, how this must bring joy to him! There is no doubt that Jehovah finds pleasure in seeing young people have a full share in proclaiming his grand purposes. They are “an inheritance” from him, and he wants only the best for them. (Ps. 127:3-5; 128:3-6) Reflecting his Father’s interest, Christ Jesus found much joy in associating with young children, and he took time to encourage them in their worship of Jehovah. He displayed tender affection for them. (Mark 9:36,37; 10:13-16) Do we view our youths in the same way that Jehovah and Christ Jesus do? Are the young people in our congregations aware of how Jehovah and the angels view their loyalty and good example? They should be commended and encouraged to make Jehovah happy by reaching out for spiritual goals. Youths, pursue goals that will result in blessings for you now and in the future.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A growing number of deaf persons are being drawn to the Fine Shepherd and are coming into a dedicated relationship with Jehovah God. (John 10:3, 11) Others in the congregation, especially the elders, must be alert to the spiritual needs of our deaf brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Meeting the Needs of the Deaf: </span><span class="font8">Arrangements are made to interpret the congregation’s meetings into sign language wherever qualified interpreters are available. If no one in the congregation knows sign language, it may be appropriate to direct deaf people to a nearby congregation that can provide this service. Of course, if no such arrangement exists In your general area, it may be possible for designated publishers to take turns sitting beside deaf persons and sharing notes with them on the main points being discussed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Circuit and Congregation Arrangement*: </span><span class="font8">Arrangements for sign-language interpreting at circuit assemblies and special assembly days are coordinated through the circuit overseer. An elder or a qualified ministerial servant may be selected as coordinator. Exemplary qualified brothers and sisters can be assigned to share in interpreting the assembly program. The same principle may be followed In the congregation, ensuring that the needs of the deaf are appropriately cared for.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> It is preferable for the deaf to be located where they can see the signers and the platform in the same line of vision. This holds true both at congregation meetings and at circuit assemblies. At congregation meetings it is preferred that the signer be seated if the number of deaf attenders is small. The elders would do well to consult a mature deaf brother, if possible, for specific suggestions on appropriate seating arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> If a qualified signer serving as an elder or a ministerial servant is available and the number of deaf brothers and sisters warrants it, the elders may decide that some meetings should be conducted entirely in sign language. The Congregation Book Study may well be the first weekly meeting so arranged. If the congregation would like to hold any of the other five weekly meetings In sign language (or in any language other than English), the elders should Inform the Society of their desire. It should be noted that American Sign Language is the language preferred by most adult deaf persons in this country.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Although communication between deaf and hearing persons may require special efforts on the part of both groups, all members of the congregation should endeavor to get acquainted with one another so that there can be a genuine interchange of encouragement. (Heb. 10:24) This spirit among the brothers will make all new ones feel welcome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Can December be a special field service month for you? It may be necessary to make some adjustments in your usual routine, but wouldn't the rewards make it worthwhile?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Some of the younger baptized publishers will have extra days off from school and would like to enroll as auxiliary pioneers for the month. How encouraging it would be for them to have some of the elders, ministerial servants, and other publishers working in the field with them! If personal circumstances do not allow you to pioneer during the month, is it possible for you to spend just a few extra hours in service with those who will be pioneering? This certainly would be mutually encouraging.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> If all the publishers put forth added effort, the elders may be able to arrange for group witnessing each day during the holiday season so that those who can pioneer will always have someone to work with in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Now is the time, individually and as family groups as well as on the congregation level, to plan to make December a special month for field service in your congregation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Many today view the Bible as outdated and unrealistic. While it is the most widely distributed and the most translated book in all history, relatively few read it, and fewer still follow its direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In contrast, we value the Bible as the Word of God. The facts show that it is historically truthful. Moreover, its remarkable harmony, its prophecies, its wisdom, and its having been a power for good in people’s lives all demonstrate that the Bible is “inspired of God.” (2 Tim. 3:16) Our personal experience and our appreciation for this wonderful gift should move us to encourage others to investigate its true value.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’ One approach might be:</span></p>

Make arrangements to return to consider the tract further —perhaps using one of the subheadings, in the form of a question, in order to stimulate interest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Another approach might be something similar to this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Do you not agree that mankind needs direction in dealing with life’s problems? [Allow for response.] In the past, people often looked to the Bible for guidance, but times have changed. Do you think that the Bible is of practical value today? [Allow for response.] Notice what is stated at 2 Timothy 3:16. [Read.] God’s written Word not only helps us to make wise decisions but also provides a reliable hope for the future.&quot; Read John 17:3. If the householder responds favorably, point out one or two specific points that you have previously selected from the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—God's Word or Man’s? to</span><span class="font8"> illustrate the practical value of the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> You may find it helpful to use some of the introductions outlined on page 10 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book under the subheading “Bible/God.” Additional information is presented on pages 58-68 that may be helpful in answering householders’ questions or in overcoming their objections.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Offering the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation:</span><span class="font8"> If sufficient interest is stimulated on the initial call or on a return visit, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> may be introduced. You might ask if the householder has a copy of the Bible and if he finds it easy to read. Depending on the answer, call attention to some of the helpful features of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation. </span><span class="font8">You could highlight one or two points from pages 276-80 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Be alert to opportunities to encourage people to read the Bible. Help interested persons to build respect and love for the written Word of God. By applying its principles in their personal lives and coming to a knowledge of the truth, they will gain many benefits both now and in the future—Ps. 119:105.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The world has changed dramatically during the past century. Although there have been advances in the fields of communication, medicine, and transportation, the quality of family life has steadily declined. Millions allow themselves to be guided by the constantly changing philosophy of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In this rapidly changing world scene, Jehovah’s people have benefited greatly by adhering to his Word. The Bible has remained unchanged for thousands of years, and its counsel is still the most practical for coping with problems we face today. How can we help interested people come to appreciate that the Bible provides true guidance for our modem day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you left the tract “Why You Can Trust The Bible” on the initial call, you may return and say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Since the Bible clearly says that it is a message from God himself and that he offers us eternal life If we believe and live by what it says, do you feel it would be worthwhile to find out more about these statements? [Allow for comment.] Notice what the Bible foretells concerning the present world system of things. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5 directly from page 5 of the tract.) Do you think this description fits the world today? [Allow for comment.] Is there sound reason to expect better conditions in the future?” You can then lay the groundwork for another visit by discussing the last two paragraphs of the tract or by using page 161 of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God's Word or Man’s?,</span><span class="font8"> highlighting the wonderful hope that the Bible holds out for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup>1f the householder was interested in the practical value of the Bible and you pointed out specific principles in chapter 12 of the book “The Bible—Cod’s Word or Man 'sf, ” you may say: </span><span class="font8">■ “We are interested in things that are practical for us today, aren’t we? Would you agree that putting an end to war would be practical? [Allow for comment.] If people learned to live together in peace with those of other nations, this would be a good start, would it not? [Allow for response ] The Bible has foretold exactly that. [Read Isaiah 2:2, 3.] Have you ever wondered how and when this will come about?” Explain that you would like to discuss this question further at a time convenient for the householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you left the “New World Translation,” you may return and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “In reading the Bible I left with you, you may have noticed that it uses God’s personal name throughout. This is an important improvement over many other Bible translations. Although some people may hesitate to use the name Jehovah, we must keep in mind that he revealed his name long ago and encouraged his servants to use it to identify him as the true and living God. Notice what the psalmist wrote at Psalm 83:18.” Read the scripture, and allow the householder to comment. According to the interest manifested, you may use additional information found under the heading “Jehovah,” beginning on page 191 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> Only the Bible provides the guidance that man needs. (Jer. 10:23) Studying God’s Word is the only way to learn about His purposes and gain His favor. Therefore, let us earnestly invite others to benefit from its wise counsel and practical advice.</span></p>

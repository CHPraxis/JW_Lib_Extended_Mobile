<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Training Bible Students to Develop Good Study Habits</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Why Important: In order to progress to spiritual maturity, Bible students must nourish their minds and hearts with more than the basic teachings of God’s Word. (Heb. 5:12-6:1) Study requires effort. It includes relating new information to what we already know and discerning its practical value. (Prov. 2:1-6) Learning to do personal research will enable students to answer Bible questions using our Christian publications. The earnest effort that they put forth to apply what they learn will equip them to withstand trials they will face as Christians. —Luke 6:47, 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Emphasize the importance of seeking Jehovah’s help in prayer prior to each study session.—John 14:26; 1 Cor. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> From the outset, encourage your student to prepare in advance for his Bible study. Show him your study copy, and teach him how to underline or highlight only key words or phrases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Have your student answer the questions in his own words. Avoid turning the study into a dry question-and-answer session in which the student simply reads answers directly from the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Encourage your student to read a portion of God’s Word daily. Show him the Bible reading schedule on jw.org, which outlines a practical way he can do this. Developing the habit of reading the Bible daily will require determination, but the effort will be worthwhile.—Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Show your student how he can find answers to Bible questions using </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY.</span><span class="font8"> Help him identify the mnemonic symbols for publications commonly used at congregation meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> At the end of a subheading or a chapter, ask your Bible student to summarize in a few sentences what he has just learned. If you do not have a student, practice summarizing a passage from the Bible or a paragraph from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> in a few sentences to improve your own reading comprehension.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ reached the heart of his listeners. On at least one occasion, the hearts of his disciples were “burning” after he clearly explained the Scriptures to them. (Luke 24:32) Since obedience to God must come from the heart, how can we stir the emotions of those whom we teach in order to prompt them to </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">make</span><span class="font8"> changes in their life?—Rom. 6:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. What effect did Jesus’ teaching have on the hearts of his listeners?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Use Tact and Discernment: For many people, simply telling them what is right and what is wrong will not move them to action. In fact, attacking their religious beliefs with a barrage of scriptures may even push them away. To motivate a person, we must first discern the reasons why he believes and acts as he does. Tactful, well-chosen viewpoint questions will encourage him to express his innermost thoughts. (Prov. 20:5) Only then can we select information from God’s Word that may touch his heart. Therefore, we must show personal interest and be patient. (Prov. 25:15) Remember that individuals make spiritual progress at different rates. Allow time for Jehovah’s holy spirit to influence their thinking and ac-tions.—Mark 4:26-29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Help Them Cultivate Positive Qualities: Bible passages that illustrate Jehovah’s goodness and love can help those we teach to cultivate positive qualities. We can use such scriptures as Psalm 139:1-4 or Luke 12:6, 7 to show the degree of God’s personal interest in each of us. When individuals develop heart appreciation for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, their love and godly devotion will grow. (Rom. 5:6-8; 1 John 4:19) Also, when they learn that their conduct affects Jehovah personally, they may be motivated to act in a way that will please and honor him.—Ps. 78:40, 41; Prov. 23:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah does not force anyone to obey his commands. Rather, he appeals to individuals by showing them the wisdom of following his advice. (Isa. 48:17, 18) We imitate Jehovah when we teach in a manner that helps people to reach their own conclusions. When individuals convince themselves of the need to make changes in their life, the results are long-lasting. (Rom. 12:2) It also draws them ever closer to “the examiner of hearts,” Jehovah. —Prov. 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. How did Ahaz demonstrate his lack of trust in God’s word spoken through the prophet Isaiah, and what question might we ask ourselves when making important decisions? (2 Ki. 16:7) [Sept. 14, w13 11/15 p. 17 par. 5]</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">4. What tactic used by the Rabshakeh is being used by opposers of God’s people today, and what quality can help us to reject the false reasoning of opposers? (2 Ki. 18:22, 25) [Sept. 14, w10 7/15 p. 13 pars. 3-4]</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Does God’s Word Have Power in Your Daily Life?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Daily Bible reading can help us to become “rooted” and “stabilized in the faith.” (Col. 2:6, 7) However, for Jehovah’s Word to have power in our lives, we must ponder over and apply its principles. (Heb. 4:12; Jas. 1:22-25) Joshua 1:8 presents an effective three-step reading process: (1) Read God’s Word “day and night.” (2) Read it “in an undertone,” which suggests reading at a pace that allows you to meditate and to imagine the setting and the circumstances. (3) Earnestly apply “all that is written in it.” Putting into practice these suggestions will enable us to “be successful” and “act wisely” in our daily life.</span></p>

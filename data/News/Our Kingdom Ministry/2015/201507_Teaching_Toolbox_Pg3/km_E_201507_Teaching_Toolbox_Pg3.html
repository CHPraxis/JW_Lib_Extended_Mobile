<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Maintain Focus on Making Disciples</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The 2014 annual service report reflects the zeal of God’s people and their determination to preach the good news of the Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) By means of the house-to-house work, special campaigns to distribute tracts and invitations, and our public witnessing initiatives, we are reaching more people with the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible</span><span class="font8">’s message than ever before. However, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1. What is needed in order for people to be saved? </span><span class="font8">individuals are to be saved, we must help them to become disciples of Jesus by studying the Bible with them.—1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Be Bible-Study Conscious: When a person shows interest, do you endeavor to obtain his contact information and then call back promptly with the goal of starting a Bible study? When was the last time that you tried demonstrating a Bible study on the initial call? When did you last offer a Bible study to those on your magazine route? Have you shown the videos Why Study the Bible? and What Happens at a Bible Study? to workmates, schoolmates, neighbors, relatives, and other acquaintances? When using a literature display, do you endeavor to inform those who take a study publication that it comes with a free Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Help From Jehovah and Jesus: By beginning his command to “make disciples” with the word “go,” Jesus indicated that we need to exert effort and show initiative. However, he did not leave us on our own but promised to be with us. (Matt. 28:19, 20) In addition, Jehovah has given us his holy spirit as well as the tools and the training that we need to teach people the truth. (Zech. 4:6; 2 Cor. 4:7) We can pray for “both the desire and the power” to share in this important work.—Phil. 2:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Preaching the good news brings us much happiness. However, our joy is increased when we teach a person the truth and help him to join us on “the road leading off into life.” (Matt. 7:14; 1 Thess. 2:19, 20) More important, by maintaining our focus on making disciples, we please Jehovah who “does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">to rep</span><span class="font8">entance.”—2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">2. Asking ourselves what questions will help us to be Bible-study conscious?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. In order to teach the truth successfully, what is required?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7">4. Why should we maintain our focus on making disciples?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>■ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Should publishers make extensive use of the Internet to witness to or to study with strangers living inanothercountry?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Some publishers have used the Internet to obtain Bible studies in lands where our work is restricted or where there are few publishers. In some cases, good results have been achieved. However, there are dangers when publishers participate in e-mail exchanges or chat room discussions with strangers. (See the July 2007 Our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> p. 3.) While the intent is to reach honesthearted ones with the Kingdom message, such discussions may lead a brother or a sister into contact with bad association, including apostates. (1 Cor. 1:19-25; Col. 2:8) Furthermore, in lands where the Kingdom work is restricted or under ban, correspondence might be monitored by the authorities. Such communication could endanger the local brothers and sisters. Therefore, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">publishers should not go online to seek out people from another country with whom to share the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Unless directed otherwise by the local branch office, if we witness informally to a stranger who is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">visiting</span><span class="font8"> from another country, we should not try to cultivate his interest after he returns home. Instead, we can show him how he can use jw.org to obtain additional information or how he can contact the local branch office. We can also encourage him to visit a Kingdom Hall near his home. Of course, there are no Kingdom Halls in some countries. If he wishes to be visited by Witnesses from his area, we should fill out a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font8"> (S-43) form and give it to the secretary, who will forward it using jw.org. The branch office that oversees the work in the country where the interested person lives is familiar with the unique circumstances there and will be in the best position to provide spiritual help.—See the June 2014 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> p. 7, and the November 2011 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> p. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a person we are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">currently calling on </span><span class="font8">moves to another country or if we are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">currently studying</span><span class="font8"> with a person in another land whom we know only through the Internet, we should follow the direction outlined above. However, we may continue to cultivate the interest until the person is contacted by the local publishers. Nevertheless, if he lives in a land where our work is restricted or banned, great caution should be used when Bible topics are discussed by letter, telephone, or electronic means.—Matt. 10:16.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Our Teaching Toolbox</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Craftsmen use a variety of tools. While some tools are occasionally needed for specialized tasks, other basic tools are used frequently. Experienced craftsmen always have these basic tools in their toolbox, and these are the ones that they are the most </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">skillf</span><span class="font8">ul at using. The Bible encourages each</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. How are Christian evangelizers like craftsmen?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Christian to apply himself in the ministry and to be “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of.” (2 Tim. 2:15) What is the most important tool in our toolbox? It is God’s Word—the principal tool we use to “make disciples.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Therefore, we should endeavor to become skillful at “handling the word of the truth aright.” However, there are other frequently used tools in our teaching toolbox that all Christians should learn to use skillfully to teach people the truth.—Prov. 22:29.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Our Basic Teaching Tools: Besides the Bible, what other tools should we use? The primary tool we have for teaching Bible truths is What Does the Bible Really Teach? After completing a study of this book with a student, we use “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love” to teach him to apply Bible principles in everyday life. Therefore, we should become proficient in using these two publications. Certain brochures should also be included in our teaching toolbox. Good News From God! is one of our main tools for starting Bible studies. If our territory has people who have limited reading ability or those who speak a language for which we have few or no publications, then we could also use Listen to God or Listen to God and Live Forever. A basic teaching tool for directing students to the organization is Who Are Doing Jehovah’s Will Today? Videos that are helpful in making disciples, such as Why Study the Bible?, What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?, and Does God Have a Name?, are tools that we should also learn to use well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Future issues of Our Kingdom Ministry will help us become skilled in using the handful of basic publications in our teaching toolbox. As we endeavor to use these tools adeptly, we will be heeding the inspired counsel: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">those</span><span class="font8"> who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

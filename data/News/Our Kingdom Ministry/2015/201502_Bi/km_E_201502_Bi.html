<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Why Be “Zealous for Fine Works”?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Are you zealous for fine works? As Kingdom publishers, we have every reason to be. Why? Consider what we read at Titus 2:11-14:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Verse 11: What is “the undeserved kindness of God,” and how have we personally benefited from it?—Rom. 3:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Verse 12: How have we been trained by God’s undeserved kindness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Verses 13 and 14: Now that we have been cleansed, what hope do we have? And for what greater purpose have we been cleansed from the world’s ungodly conduct?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> How do these verses stimulate you to be zealous for fine works?</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Witnessing Through an Intercom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Why Important: Witnessing through an intercom can be intimidating. How can we avoid letting this challenge dampen our zeal for fine works? Keep in mind that witnessing through an intercom may be the only way to reach some people with the good news. (Rom. 10:14) Experience has shown that an effective witness can be given this way. (See the 2011 Yearbook, pp. 65-66, and the 2000 Yearbook, p. 54, par. 3.) Consider the following suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Prepare a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font8"> presentation, and write it out so that you can read it directly to the householder through the intercom. This can boost your confidence. At the outset, explain the purpose of your visit. Use the householder’s name if it is shown on the directory. Conclude by offering to deliver (or leave in the person’s door) a tract or a magazine that will provide more information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Maintain a positive viewpoint. Smile and gesture as if you were speaking face-to-face with the person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Relax and be conversational. Speak clearly and with good volume. Avoid unnecessary pauses, but do not speak too fast.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Use good judgment. In large buildings, there may be many intercoms. Perhaps you could choose just three or so to ring, take note of where you left off, and then leave. Residents of the building may become alarmed ifwe linger in the foyer in order to ring every intercom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

Why is praying to Jehovah the first step in preparing for the ministry? (Ps. 143:10; Acts 4:31) In addition to prayer, what else is needed? (Ezra 7:10) After preparing ourselves spiritually, what practical steps should we take to organize our literature and our service bags? What positive effect does being prepared have on us? (See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> July 15, 2008, p. 10, par. 9.) How do you prepare for the ministry? Have a publisher demonstrate how he prepares for the ministry by reviewing the tracts, magazines, or brochures that he will be using. He then organizes his service bag and makes sure that his electronic device is ready to play. Emphasize that all should be well-prepared when going in the ministry. (2 Tim. 3:17)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah accomplishes his purpose with zeal. Referring to some of the blessings of </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">God’</span><span class="font8">s Kingdom, Isaiah 9:7 says: “The zeal of</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">1. What do Jehovah’s Witnesses make a special effort to do during the Memorial season?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah of armies will do this.” Similarly, during his earthly ministry, God’s Son demonstrated great zeal for true worship. (John 2:13-17; 4:34) Each year during the Memorial season, millions of publishers around the world make a special effort to imitate the zeal of Jehovah and Jesus by increasing their activity in the ministry. Will you be among them?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Memorial Campaign: This year’s campaign to advertise the Memorial will begin on Saturday, March 7. Plan now to have a zealous share in the ministry. Congregations will be abuzz with excitement as they actively share in covering as much of their territory as possible. Make a concerted effort to invite your Bible students, return visits, workmates, relatives, and schoolmates by giving them an invitation or by using jw.org.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Auxiliary Pioneer: Zeal will also motivate us to expand our ministry. No doubt many will be able to auxiliary pioneer during March and April, since we will have the option of choosing the 30-hour requirement. During your family worship or personal study, give prayerful consideration to how you can do this. (Prov. 15:22) Your enthusiasm for this campaign can stimulate others to zealous activity. If you make personal adjustments in order to do more, you will be imitating the zeal of Jesus.—Mark 6:31-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Our imitating the zeal of Jehovah and Jesus during this Memorial season will bring rich rewards. Many more in the territory will receive a witness. We will experience the joy and satisfaction that comes from serving Jehovah and giving to others. (Acts 20:35) Most important, we will please our zealous God and his Son.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Proclaim the Truth About Jesus With Zeal</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Our zeal increases when we know how to share the truth about Jesus with others. Jesus is the foundation cornerstone on which true faith is built. (Eph. 2:20) Without him, we would have no hope for life. (Acts 4:12) Therefore, it is important that all recognize Jesus’ position in God’s purpose. Many have been misled by unscriptural doctrines. Sadly, they stand to lose out on the promises God’s Word holds out to those who exercise faith in Jesus. Our zeal for the truth will move us to help honesthearted ones to gain a correct understanding of Jesus, his relationship to God, and his role in God’s purpose. During this Memorial season, will you zealously proclaim the truth about Jesus?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">3. Why was Judah designated to be the first tribe to take possession of the land allotted to it? ( Judg. 1:2, 4) [ Jan. 19, w05 1/15 p. 24 par. 5]</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font8">Hebrews 10:24 encourages us to “consider one another so as to incite [“motivate,” ftn.] to love and fine works.” We can motivate our brothers by the example we set and by our expressions of faith. Share your good experiences with others in the congregation. Let them see the joy you feel in serving Jehovah. At the same time, avoid unfavorably comparing them to yourself or others. (Gal. 6:4) Seek to use your strengths to motivate others to “love and fine works,” not guilt and fine works. (See the Ministry School book, p. 158, par. 4.) If we incite to love, then the works—such as doing good to others materially or preaching—will follow.—2 Cor. 1:24.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Are You Preparing for the Memorial?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">It was Nisan 13 of 33 C.E. Jesus knew that he had one final evening to spend with his closest associates before his execution. He would celebrate his last Passover with them and then institute a new observance, the Lord’s Evening Meal. Such an important occasion certainly required preparation. Therefore, he dispatched Peter and John to get things ready. (Luke 22:7-13) Every year since then, it has been necessary for Christians who desire to observe the Memorial to prepare for this event. (Luke 22:19) What basic things should we do to prepare for the upcoming Memorial on April 3?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Developing a Magazine Route</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">Why Important: </span><span class="font12">Many people who enjoy reading our magazines do not wish to study the Bible with us. Perhaps they are happy with their religion, or they feel that they do not have time to study. However, as they regularly read our magazines, they may form a longing for God’s Word. (1 Pet. 2:2) A particular article may strike a responsive chord, or their circumstances may change. Regular, brief visits will make them more comfortable with us and help us learn what their interests and concerns are. Eventually, a Bible study may be started.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>How to Do It:</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font11"> Each month, schedule time to bring the individual the latest issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> Maybe you can visit at other times during the month to whet his appetite for an article from the magazines you left or to offer the publication being featured that month. Keep good records.—See the January 2014 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> p. 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font11"> Prepare for each visit. Rather than simply dropping the magazines off, engage the householder in conversation and try to build a rapport with him so that you can cultivate his interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font11"> Be alert for opportunities to start a study. If someone on your route asks you what the Bible says on a certain topic, bring him a study publication that contains the answer, and discuss it together. Before you leave, raise a related question and consider it on the next visit. If you are regularly and systematically having even brief discussions using the Bible or one of our study publications, you are conducting a Bible study. Have you offered the householder the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font11"> brochure and demonstrated a short Bible study? Have you shown him the videos </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why Study the Bible?</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens ata Bible Study?</span><span class="font11"> Even if the person has not been receptive to a study in the past, circumstances change. Would it be beneficial for you to try again?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font11"> Make a list of those who could be on a magazine route. Offer them the current issues of the magazines, and tell them that you will bring them the next issue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Song 32 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Meetings for Field Service That Accomplish Their Purpose</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> On one occasion, Jesus met with 70 of his disciples before they went on a preaching campaign. (Luke 10:1-11) He gave encouragement by reminding them that they would not be alone and that they were being directed by “the Master of the harvest,” Jehovah. He also gave them instructions that equipped them to do the work, and he organized them “by twos.” Today, the meetings we have prior to going out in the ministry serve a similar purpose—to encourage, equip, and organize us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Currently, a meeting for field service lasts from 10 to 15 minutes, which includes organizing the groups, assigning territory, and saying a prayer. This is now being adjusted. Beginning in April, a meeting for field service will last from five to seven minutes. </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Howe</span><span class="font11">ver, when it follows another congrega-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">1. Meetings for field service have what purpose? 2. How long should a meeting for field service be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">tion meeting, it should be even shorter, since those attending have already enjoyed a fine Scriptural discussion. Having brief meetings for field service will enable all to spend more time in the ministry. In addition, if pioneers or publishers have begun their preaching before the meeting for field service, only a brief interruption of their activity will be necessary.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Meetings for field service should be arranged so that they will be most helpful to the publishers. In many congregations it is advantageous for field service groups to meet separately rather than to combine at one location. This may make it easier for publishers to travel to the meeting for field service and perhaps to the territory. Publishers can be quickly organized, and it may be easier for group overseers to give close attention to those in their care. The body of elders can consider local circumstances and determine what is best. Before ending the meeting with a brief prayer, all should know where and with whom they are going to work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Not Less Important Than Other Congregation Meetings: Because meetings for field service are held for the benefit of those who are going out in the ministry, they may not be attended by the entire congregation. However, this does not mean that they should be taken lightly or viewed as less important than other congregation meetings. Like all our meetings, meetings for field service are a provision from Jehovah that enables us to incite one another to love and fine works. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Therefore, the conductor should be well-prepared so that the discussion will honor Jehovah and benefit those in attendance. If it is practical to do so, publishers who are going out in the ministry should make an effort to attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How may meetings for field service be arranged so that they are most helpful to the publishers?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">4. Why should meetings for field service not be viewed as less important than other meetings?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Preparation by the Conductor: In order for someone to be well-prepared to present a meeting part, he needs to receive the assignment in advance. This is no less true with regard to meetings for field service. Of course, when field service groups meet separately, group overseers or their assistants conduct the meeting for their group. However, when the congregation will have a combined meeting for field service, the service overseer will assign someone to conduct. Some service overseers give a schedule to all the conductors and post a copy of it on the information board.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The service overseer should use good judgment when assigning conductors, keeping in mind that the quality of these meetings will also depend on the teaching and organizing ability of those conducting. If no elder, ministerial servant, or other qualified baptized brother is available to be assigned on some days, the service overseer should assign a capable baptized sister to conduct. —See the article “When a Sister Must Conduct.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> When we receive an assignment for the Theocratic Ministry School or Service Meeting, we take it seriously and prepare well. Few of us would wait until we are traveling to the meeting to begin thinking about what we will say. An assignment to conduct a meeting for field service should be viewed the same way. Now that the meeting for field service will be shorter, good preparation is especially important so that the meeting will be meaningful and end on time. Good preparation also includes obtaining territory in advance.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> What to Discuss: Since circumstances vary from territory to territory, the faithful slave has not provided an outline for each meeting for field service. The box “During a Meeting for Field Service, You Might Consider” outlines some possibilities. Generally, the meeting will be handled as a discussion. On occasion, it may include a well-prepared demonstration or an appropriate video from jw.org. When preparing for a meeting for field service, the conductor should think about what will encourage and equip those going out in the ministry that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> On Saturdays, for example, most publishers offer The Watchtower and Awake! Many who share in the ministry on Saturdays do not go out during the week, so they may have difficulty remembering the presentation they practiced during their Family Worship evening. Therefore, it may be beneficial for the conductor to review one of the sample presentations from the back of Our Kingdom Ministry. Other options include discussing how to incorporate a local news item, event, or holiday into a magazine presentation or how to lay the groundwork for the next visit if the magazines are accepted. If some at the meeting for field service have already been using the particular magazines being offered, the conductor could ask them to share some brief suggestions or relate encouraging experiences. On Sundays, the conductor might choose to do something similar with regard to the offer for the month. Study publications, such as the Good News and Listen to God brochures and the Bible Teach book may be offered any day, so the conductor could briefly consider how one of these publications may be offered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">7. What are some things that the conductor could discuss?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">8. What might be most beneficial to discuss during meetings for field service on Saturdays and Sundays?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> If the congregation is engaged in a special campaign on the weekend, the conductor might consider how to offer the current magazines along with the invitation or the tract, or he could discuss what to do if interest is shown. Another option would be to share experiences that highlight the value of such campaigns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Preparation by Publishers: Publishers also have a part in making a meeting for field service successful. By preparing in advance for service, perhaps during their family worship, they will have something to share with other publishers. Good preparation also includes obtaining magazines and literature supplies before arriving at the meeting for field service so that all can leave for the territory without unnecessary delay.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> It is also important to plan to arrive at the meeting for field service a few minutes before it begins. Of course, we endeavor to be on time for all congregation meetings. However, it can be especially disruptive when we arrive late for a meeting for field service. How so? The brother taking the lead considers a number of factors before organizing the group. If few publishers are present, he may choose to send everyone to a territory that has been partially worked. If some walked to the meeting for field service and the territory is a distance away, he may pair these publishers with those who drove vehicles. If the territory is in a high-crime area, he may assign brothers to work with or near groups of sisters. Infirm publishers might be assigned to work a street that is level or that has homes with few</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">er sta</span><span class="font11">irs. Newer publishers might be assigned</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">9. What could be discussed on the weekend when engaged in a special campaign?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">10, 11. Why is preparation by the publishers important for the success of a meeting for field service?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">When preparing for a meeting for field service, the conductor should think about what will encourage and equip those going out in the ministry that day</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">to work with more experienced ones. But, if publishers arrive late, the arrangements will often have to be revised or redone in order to accommodate the latecomers. Of course, we may on occasion have a legitimate reason for being late. However, if we are habitually late, we might ask ourselves if it is because we lack appreciation for meetings for field service or because we fail to organize our affairs in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Publishers who meet for service can choose to make their own arrangements before the meeting begins, or they can have a partner assigned to them. If you generally make your own arrangements, could you “widen out” by working with a variety of publishers rather than with the same close friends each time? (2 Cor. 6:11-13, ftn.) Could you occasionally arrange to work with a newer publisher to help him make advancement in his teaching ability? (1 Cor. 10:24; 1 Tim. 4: 13, 15) Listen carefully to any instructions that you are given, including direction regarding where you are to begin preaching. When the meeting concludes, avoid changing the arrangements and depart for the territory promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> After preaching, the 70 whom Jesus organized for the ministry “returned with joy.” (Luke 10:17) No doubt, Jesus’ meeting with them before they began preaching helped them to be successful. Today, meetings for field service can have a similar benefit. If all involved are conscientious and do their part, meetings for field service will encourage, equip, and organize us to accomplish our commission to give “a witness to all the na-tions.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark23"></a>When a Sister Must Conduct</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">A sister should wear a head covering and would normally be seated when conducting a meeting for field service. What she chooses to discuss would be similar to what a brother would consider. While she should avoid giving the appearance of instructing those in attendance, she may initiate a group discussion. If she invites another baptized sister to say the prayer, that sister should also wear a head covering. If a baptized brother joins the meeting after it has started, the sister would normally invite him to finish the meeting. The service overseer should try to anticipate unusual situations and give appropriate instructions so as to minimize awkwardness. For example, a very young, perhaps preteen, baptized brother might attend when a sister is assigned to conduct, but the elders feel that he is not yet qualified to conduct the meeting. In such a case, the service overseer can inform those involved that the assigned sister should conduct the meeting, but the brother should say the prayer if the elders feel that he is qualified. Or perhaps there is an adult brother who is restricted from conducting the meeting or offering congregation prayer for reasons known by the elders. Without revealing confidential information, the elders should let the assigned sisters know that they should conduct and pray even if he is in attendance. The elders might also let the brother know which days sisters are scheduled to conduct the meetings for field service.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The revised edition of the </span><span class="font11">New World Translation </span><span class="font12">has a section in the beginning called “An Introduction to God’s Word.” How can we use this new tool when preparing presentations for the ministry? Since this section groups scriptures under various Bible topics, similar to the way the </span><span class="font11">Reasoning </span><span class="font12">book does, it can be very useful in starting conversations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> You might use question 8 and say: “We are making brief visits in the neighborhood because many people wonder, ‘Is God to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">blam</span><span class="font12">e for human suffering?’ [In some terri-</span></p></li></ul>

How may we use “An Introduction to God’s Word” in the ministry? </span><span class="font12">tories, it is more effective to </span><span class="font11">show </span><span class="font12">the question to the householder.] What is your opinion? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives a satisfying answer to that question.” Read and discuss one or more of the cited verses directly from the Bible. If the householder expresses interest, you could show him the 20 questions listed in the introduction and ask him to choose one to discuss on the next visit. Or you could offer one of our study publications that has more information on the subject you just considered.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Questions 4 and 13 through 17 may be especially helpful when preaching in territories where people belong to a nonChristian religion. For example, you might use the information from question 17 and say: “We are making brief visits as a public service to families. Would you agree that families face numerous challenges today? [Allow for response.] Many couples have found these wise words helpful: “The wife should have deep respect for her husband.” [You do not need to mention that this is from Ephesians 5:33. If you are speaking to a woman, you might instead recite the words of Ephesians 5:28.] Do you think that applying that advice would be beneficial in a marriage?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At the end of your conversation, make arrangements to continue the discussion on another occasion. Perhaps you can plan to talk about one of the other scriptures from the question you used. At an appropriate time, let the householder know that the wise sayings you have been sharing with him are from the Bible. Based on your previous discussions and the person’s view of the Bible, offer a publication that you think would appeal to him.—See the insert in the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Dece</span><span class="font12">mber 2013 </span><span class="font11">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Starting a Doorstep Bible Study Using the Good News From God! Brochure</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Why I m porta nt: To make disciples, we must be teachers of God’s Word. (Matt. 28:19, 20) All of us can effectively teach the truth by using the tools that have been given to us. The Good News From God! brochure is specially designed to help us teach the truth to others. In fact, we could use it to start a Bible study with a householder on the initial call right at his doorstep.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>How to Do It:</span></h5>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Pray for the desire to conduct a study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Also, beg Jehovah for his help in starting a Bible study and in becoming an effective teacher of the truth.—Phil. 2:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> During family worship or personal study, take time to embed the presentation in your heart. You can thus speak with conviction and start a doorstep Bible study while in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">“I’m here because people are concerned about where this world is heading. Do you think conditions will ever improve? [Allow for response.] Many people are surprised to learn that the Bible contains good news that can give us hope. Here are some of the questions that the Bible answers.” Hand the householder a brochure, and invite him to choose a question from the back cover that interests him the most. Then go to the lesson, and demonstrate the study. Make arrangements to return to consider the next question in that lesson.</span></p>

Begin by interviewing two or three young children in the congregation. Who is their favorite Bible character? According to the Bible, what did he or she do? In what way would they like to imitate the Bible character? Afterward, continue with a talk explaining how children can benefit from the Bible-character cards found on jw.org. (Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS </span><span class="font11">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">CHILDREN.) Each Bible-character card includes a profile and illustrations of the character, a map of where he lived, a time line showing when he lived, and three questions and answers about him. Each card is designed to be printed out and collected. Encourage parents with young children to make use of this tool to teach their children about “the days of old.”—Deut. 32:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: “Learning From More Experienced Publishers.” </span><span class="font10">Discussion. When considering paragraph two, invite the audience to relate how they benefited from working in the ministry with an experienced publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 4 and Prayer</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Learning From More Experienced Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">We truly treasure the experienced publishers in the congregation. Some have been faithfully serving Jehovah for many years. Others may have acquired good skills in the ministry more recently. These publishers have seen how Jesus has directed the Christian congregation in these last days by expanding the preaching and disciple-making work. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By sharing in this ministry, they have received “the power beyond what is normal” when facing personal challenges and trials. (2 Cor. 4:7) There is a lot to learn from these seasoned publishers. When given the opportunity, they find delight in teaching others what they have learned. (Ps. 71:18) Thus, we should make opportunities to learn from them. How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the Ministry. To be effective in the ministry, new or less experienced publishers need training. A great deal can be learned by observing how mature publishers carry out their ministry. (See the article in the February 15, 2015, Watchtower, “Maintain Your Zeal for the Ministry,” the third paragraph under the subheading “Help Less Experienced Ones.”) How have you benefited by working with such ones in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Could you invite a well-qualified publisher to work with you in the ministry? If the publisher is infirm, perhaps you could periodically conduct one of your Bible studies at his home. After the study, ask the publisher for his observations and advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Spend Personal Time With Them: Get to know experienced publishers by spending time with them. Invite one of them to your family worship and interview him. If the publisher is infirm, could arrangements be made to enjoy family worship at his home? Find out how he came into the truth. What blessings has he enjoyed? What growth has he seen locally? What joy has he found in serving Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Be understanding and balanced in your expectations. Like all of us, long-standing publishers have differing gifts in the ministry. (Rom. 12:6-8) Some are advanced in age, and this may limit the amount of time that they can spend with us. Nevertheless, we can learn much from them because of their experience in serving Jehovah faithfully.</span></p>

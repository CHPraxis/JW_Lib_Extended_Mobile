<p><span class="font10">Song 98 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Make the Best Use of Your Time in the Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses spent 1,945,487,604 hours in the ministry during the 2014 service year—clear evidence that we are resolved to stay busy in Jehovah’s service! (Ps. 110:3; 1 Cor. 15:58) Since “the time left is reduced,” is it possible to use our precious hours in the ministry to contact even more people? —1 Cor. 7:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Making the best use of our time in the ministry requires flexibility. For instance, if you regularly spend an hour or more in a particular aspect of the ministry without speaking to anyone, could you make adjustments in order to find and talk to more people? Circumstances vary from place to place. However, the following suggestions may help you to make better use of your time so that you can avoid “striking the air.”—1 Cor. 9:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Witnessing: </span><span class="font11">For many decades, publishers have customarily started their day in the ministry by preaching from house to house. However, since many individuals work during the day, why nottry preaching from house to house in the late afternoon or early evening, when more people are at home and relaxed? During the day, street or business witnessing may yield better results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Witnessing: </span><span class="font11">Tables and mobile displays should be set up in high-traffic areas within the congregation’s territory boundary. (See the July 2013 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> p. 5.) If pedestrian traffic diminishes in an area designated for public witnessing, the Congregation Service Committee may decide that the mobile display or table should be relocated to an area with higher pedestrian traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits and Bible Studies: </span><span class="font11">Is it possible to schedule your return visits and Bible studies during times when other features of the ministry are less productive? For instance, if the house-to-house ministry is productive on Saturday mornings, could you have your Bible study in the afternoon or in the evening? When making return visits, could publishers split into smaller car groups so as to accomplish more in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While it is true that we can count our time whenever we engage in the ministry, our joy increases when we are productive. If you find that participating in one feature of the ministry is not effective at a specific time, try another feature. Pray to Jehovah, “the Master of the harvest,” for his direction so that you can make the best use of your time in the minis-try!—Matt. 9:38.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Song 75 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How to Witness Using a Literature Display</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Witnessing with a mobile cart or a table display is proving to be very effective in drawing honesthearted ones to the truth. (John 6:44) Therefore, elders have been encouraged to organize public witnessing in areas of the congregation’s territory where there is high pedestrian traffic. Since mobile displays are not stationary, generally there is no need to ask permission from the authorities. Who are qualified to participate? Publishers who demonstrate good judgment, present themselves in a dignified way, and have good conversation skills. The following are some dos and don’ts that will help publishers have more success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Do:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Be friendly, welcoming, and helpful to passersby. Some publishers give a warm, genuine smile and say a friendly greeting. If someone looks at the display as he passes by, you might say, “You can take something if you like.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Stand at an appropriate distance from the display. In some places publishers experience success when they stand within a few feet of the display. Others find that this method makes passersby hesitant to stop, so they stand a little farther away and wait until someone stops at the display. Once a person approaches the display, try to engage him in conversation, perhaps by asking, “Have you ever thought about that question before?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Use the Bible as often as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Explain the Bible study arrangement to anyone who takes one of our study publications, such as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book. Offer to play the video </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why Study the Bible?</span><span class="font11"> on an electronic device.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Obtain contact information from interested ones when possible. If the person does not live in your territory, fill out a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font11"> (S-43) form, and give it to the secretary as soon as possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Be aggressive, insistent, or pushy or stand next to the display like a sentinel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> View this form of witnessing as simply a way to distribute literature. When we are in the ministry, our goal is to start Bible studies, so we should try to engage individuals in conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Block the display or become too engrossed in conversation with your partner. If you must use your cell phone for a personal call, it is usually best to step away from the display.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> Get involved in debates with opposers. If an opposer becomes abusive, it may be necessary to move to another location.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">1. What kind of love is loyal love, and in what areas of life is it especially needed? (Ruth 1:16, 17) [Mar. 2, w12 7/1 p. 26 par. 6]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. How did Ruth acquire the reputation of being “an excellent woman”? (Ruth 3:11) [Mar. 2, w12 10/1 p. 23 par. 1]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. When we are confronted with problems, in what way can we benefit from Hannah’s example? (1 Sam. 1:16-18) [Mar. 9, w07 3/15 p. 16 pars. 4-5]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. When Samuel was a boy “growing up before Jehovah,” what was it that protected him from the bad example of Eli’s sons? (1 Sam. 2:21) [Mar. 9, w10 10/1 p. 16 pars. 2-3]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. In what way can we benefit from Saul’s refusal to act rashly when “worthless men” rejected his kingship? (1 Sam. 10:22, 27) [Mar. 23, w05 3/15 p.23 par. 1]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">6. What vital lesson do we learn from Saul’s mistaken view that a sacrifice could be substituted for obedience to Jehovah? (1 Sam. 15:22, 23) [Mar. 30, w07 6/15 p. 26 pars. 3-4]</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> If you were planning a special meal for family or friends, one that required much effort and expense to prepare, you would likely be enthusiastic when extending invitations. Similarly, much work has gone into preparing the spiritual feast that will be presented at our upcoming convention. Beginning three weeks before the start of our convention, Jehovah is allowing us the privilege of inviting others to attend. What will help us to extend the invitations with enthusiasm?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We will be moved to have a full share in the campaign if we reflect appreciatively on how much we personally benefit from the refreshing instruction that Jehovah provides at our conventions. (Isa. 65:13, 14) We should remember, too, that our annual campaign yields results.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will You Say? </span><span class="font11">After giving</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a customary greeting, you might say:</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">convention with us, while others will not. Regardless of how many respond, however, our diligent efforts during the campaign bring praise to Jehovah and reflect his gener-osity.—Ps. 145:3, 7; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Each body of elders should determine how they can give the invitations wide distribution, including whether to leave them at not-at-homes or offer them in public witnessing within their territory. On weekends the magazines should be offered along with the invitation when appropriate. After the campaign concludes, how happy we will be to know that we participated enthusiastically and that as many people as possible joined us at the spiritual banquet that Jehovah provided!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How will the invitations be distributed?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">It Gets Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font11">Several years ago when one sister was participating in the invitation campaign, she wondered if all the effort was worthwhile. She thought, ‘Will people actually respond and attend the convention with us?’ On Saturday morning of the convention, she noticed a Sikh gentleman sitting nearby, so she decided to introduce herself. It became apparent that he was at the convention because he had received one of our invitations. He had a number of questions that the sister was able to answer. He commented on how much he was enjoying the program and how impressed he was by the appearance and conduct of the delegates. Later on the same day, the sister struck up a conversation with a couple sitting near her. They too had received an invitation and had come to the convention by bus. They were enjoying the convention and planned to attend on Sunday. The sister then realized how important our annual campaign is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font11">Ata recent convention, a husband and wife who are regular pioneers introduced themselves to an older couple. The couple explained that they were there for the first time. “Who invited you?” the pioneers asked. “When we came home one day, we found the invitation under our door,” was the reply. They read the invitation and even filled out the coupon on the back. Other delegates at the convention shared their lunch with the couple. They enjoyed the program so much that they made plans to return the next day. Arrangements were made to visit them and follow up on the interest.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Convention Reminders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times: </span><span class="font12">The doors to the convention site will open at 8:00 a.m. The introductory music will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. At that time, all of us should go to our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at about 5:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at about 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> ‘Praise Jehovah With Song’: </span><span class="font12">God’s people in ancient times praised Jehovah in song, and music continues to be an important part of true worship today. (Ps. 28:7) Each session of our regional convention begins with a musical interlude. This is not merely background music but is prepared so that we may learn about and worship Jehovah. Thus, when the chairman announces that the musical interlude is about to begin, that is the time to be seated and listen with appreciation to the music, rather than to converse. Our doing so shows that we value the efforts of the members of the Watchtower orchestra. Twice a year these brothers and sisters travel at their own expense to Patterson, New York, in order to produce beautiful music for our enjoyment. After listening intently to the musical interlude, everyone should join in praising Jehovah by singing our Kingdom songs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Parking: </span><span class="font12">At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking is usually limited, so carpooling should be done to the extent possible. Only those with a license plate or placard for the disabled will be allowed to park in the area reserved for such ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Seat Saving: </span><span class="font12">When the doors to the facility are opened each morning, please do not rush to the seating area, as if competing with fellow attenders. Please be considerate of others, even sacrificing our preferences for the sake of our brothers. A self-sacrificing spirit identifies us as true Christians and moves onlookers to praise God. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Cor. 13:5; 1 Pet. 2: 12) Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle, living with you in the same home, or currently studying the Bible with you. Please do not store things on seats that you are not saving. Your cooperation in this regard will allow others to see that those seats are available. Special seating has been provided for the elderly and the infirm. Since this seating is limited, only one or two persons who are directly assisting the elderly or infirm individual may sit with him or her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Modest Dress: </span><span class="font12">Our dress during the convention should be appropriate and modest, not reflecting the extreme styles common in the world. (1 Tim. 2:9) Even when checking in and out of the hotel and during times of leisure before and after the sessions, we want to avoid an overly casual or slovenly appearance. Thus we will be proud to wear our convention badge and not be embarrassed to give a witness when we have an opportunity. Our appearance and fine conduct while attending the upcoming conventions will not only attract hon-esthearted people to the Bible’s lifesaving message but it will also bring joy to Jehovah.—Zeph. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Good Manners With Electronic Devices: </span><span class="font12">We show good manners during the program by adjusting our cell phones or other electronic devices to a setting that will not disturb others. If using a camera, video recorder, electronic tablet, or other such device, we want to be considerate by not disturbing others or blocking their view. We also display good manners by not texting or e-mailing needlessly during the program.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Noon Meal: </span><span class="font12">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large familysize picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Donations: </span><span class="font12">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations can also be made by means of a debit or credit card.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Medication: </span><span class="font12">If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention. Diabetic syringes and needles must be disposed of properly as hazardous waste and not in trash receptacles at the convention facility or hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Safety Precautions: </span><span class="font12">Please be especially mindful of preventing injuries that can be caused by slipping and tripping. Each year injuries occur that are related to footwear, especially high-heeled shoes. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow one to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font12">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To hear the program, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font12">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fragrances: </span><span class="font12">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in people with respiratory or related problems.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11"> Please Follow Up </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">(S-43) Forms: </span><span class="font12">A Please Follow Up form should be used to provide information regarding any interest found through informal witnessing during the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room or given to your congregation secretary on your return home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">■</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Restaurants: </span><span class="font12">Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. Dress in a way that befits a Christian minister. Leave a tip if this is customary.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font12">(2) Do not cancel your reservation except for an emergency situation, and notify the hotel as soon as it occurs so that others needing accommodations can use the room.

<li>
<p><span class="font12">(3) Please note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, it is standard practice for the hotel to place a hold on funds in your account to cover your total room cost, plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(4) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font13">When a person allows us time to share the good news with him, we make good use of the opportunity and unleash the power of God’s Word by reading scriptures directly from the Bible.

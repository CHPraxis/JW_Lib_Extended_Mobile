<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Offering the </span><span class="font13">Bible Teach </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Book</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Why Important: The Bible Teach book is a primary tool in our teaching toolbox. However, before we can use it to study with someone, we must first place it with him. Therefore, all of us should endeavor to become skillful at offering the Bible Teach book in the ministry. (Prov. 22:29) There are many options, and publishers should use what works for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font10"> Raise an interest-arousing question that you can use to direct the householder to a specific chapter in the book. You may even select one of the questions at the beginning of each chapter. After hearing the householder’s response, read an appropriate scripture and then show him a paragraph on that subject and perhaps briefly discuss it together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font10"> Another option is to use the introductory pages to stimulate interest and then show the householder where the book gives the Bible’s answer. For example, you might refer to a recent tragedy covered in the news and explain that many have wondered about the answers to the questions on page 3. Or you could say that you are visiting your neighbors to share a positive view of the future. Then show the pictures on pages 4-5 and ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Another possibility is to say that you are making brief visits to help people find answers to life’s big questions. Then show the householder the questions at the bottom of page 6, and ask which one interests him the most.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font10"> Use the direct approach for starting a Bible study. You might say: “We are showing this Bible study aid to our neighbors. Have you seen it before? [Allow for response.] If you have just a few minutes, I’d like to demonstrate how it can be used with your own copy of the Bible.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font10"> Have practice sessions during your family worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font10"> When in the ministry, share with other publishers what you plan to say. (Prov. 27: 17) Change your presentation if it is not effective.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Audio Recordings—How to Use Them</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Many enjoy using jw.org to </span><span class="font10">read </span><span class="font11">delightful and accurate words of truth. (Eccl. 12: 10) However, have you made use of the audio recordings? These make it possible to </span><span class="font10">listen </span><span class="font11">to much of the information on our website. How might audio recordings benefit us?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. In addition to written publications, what beneficial provision do we have?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For Our Personal or Family Study: Listening to audio recordings of the Bible, the magazines, or a publication while traveling or engaging in everyday activities may help us to make better use of our time. (Eph. 5: 15, 16) We can add variety to our family worship by listening to the reading of material while following along in our copy of the publication. Using audio recordings during personal study is especially helpful if we would like to improve in our reading or if we are learning a language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> For the Ministry: People in our territory who feel that they are too busy to read may be willing to listen to audio recordings. Or we may encounter those who speak a different tongue and who are more likely to respond if they hear the Kingdom message in their “own native language.” (Acts 2:6-8) In some areas, listening is an important part of the culture. For example, in the Hmong culture, people traditionally pass on their history to younger generations orally and they do quite well at retaining information that they hear. Many African cultures enjoy learning through storytelling.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In your territory, would it be beneficial to play a sample of an audio recording in the householder’s language? Might someone benefit from an audio publication that we send him in an e-mail? Could we download an audio publication onto a CD and give it to an interested householder, perhaps along with the printed version? Every complete electronic book, brochure, magazine, or tract that we give someone in the ministry may be counted as a placement. Audio recordings are designed for us to use in our personal study and also to </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">plant</span><span class="font11"> seeds of Kingdom truth.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Preparation Needed to Teach With Skill</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus was asked the same question about everlasting life on at least two occasions, but each time he tailored his reply to the needs of the questioner. (Luke 10:25-28; 18:18-20) Therefore, although we may know the Bible study material well, we should prepare it beforehand with the student in mind. What points might he struggle to understand or accept? Which of the cited scriptures should we read with him? How much material should we try to cover? We may need to prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp the information. In addition, since it is Jehovah who makes the seed of truth grow in the heart, we should ask for Jehovah’s blessing on our preparation for the study, on our student, and on our efforts to help him spiritually.—1 Cor. 3:6; Jas. 1:5.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Use Features of the </span><span class="font14">Bible Teach </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Effectively</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">As a Bible student learns what the Bible really teaches and applies what he learns, he will grow and bear spiritual fruit. (Ps. 1: 1-3) We can help our student progress by making good use of some helpful features of the </span><span class="font10">Bible Teach </span><span class="font11">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Introductory Questions: </span><span class="font11">Each chapter begins with questions that are answered in the lesson. You could ask these questions rhetorically to whet the student’s appetite for your upcoming discussion. Or you could invite him to comment briefly on each question. If he expresses a wrong idea, there is no need to correct him at this point. His comments will help you to discern what points require attention and em-phasis.—Prov. 16:23; 18:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Appendix: </span><span class="font11">If the student understands and accepts the material in the main text, you can simply encourage him to review the corresponding appendix material on his own. At the next study, you might take a few minutes to make sure that he understands it. However, if it would benefit him, you should take time during the study to discuss the appendix material or a portion thereof by reading the paragraphs and asking questions that you prepared in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Review Box: </span><span class="font11">The review box at the end of each chapter contains statements that answer the introductory questions. You can use this feature to make sure that your student understands and can explain the main points. Read each statement together out loud as well as any accompanying scriptures. Then invite your student to use the scripture(s) to explain why the statement is true.—Acts 17:2, 3.</span></p>

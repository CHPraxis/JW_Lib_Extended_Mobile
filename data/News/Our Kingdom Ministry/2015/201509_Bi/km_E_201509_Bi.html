<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Witnessing in Business Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Why Important: </span><span class="font9">Since many people work long hours, often the best way to reach them with the Kingdom message is by witnessing to them at their workplace. Witnessing in business territory can be enjoyable and productive because there are no not-at-homes and workers tend to be polite to those they view as potential customers. In order to be effective, publishers must use good judgment and be exemplary in their dress and grooming. (2 Cor. 6:3) </span><span class="font8">Therefore, the service overseer should carefully monitor how often business territories are worked and by whom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Prepare a presentation that is brief. If we take too much of the worker’s time, we may not be given opportunities to speak to him in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Choose a time to visit when the businesses are less busy, such as when they first open.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Endeavor to speak first with the person in charge. Be warm and friendly. You might say, “We are visiting people briefly at their workplace because it is difficult to find them at home.” Give him a brief presentation, and offer a tract, the magazines, or another piece of literature. So that we will not be confused with salesmen, it is best not to mention the donation arrangement unless we are asked how our work is financed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> If the person in charge is friendly, ask for permission to speak briefly to the other workers. At some businesses, it may be better to ask if you can leave some reading material in the break room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Use good judgment, and be flexible. For example, if a worker is talking to a customer or is busy, wait until he is free before approaching him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">• </span><span class="font8">During your next Family Worship evening, practice a brief presentation you might use if you work in business territory.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Imitate Their Faith</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> During the week of October 19, 2015, we will begin consideration of the Imitate Their Faith book at the Congregation Bible Study. This publication examines the Biblical accounts of 14 men and women of faith. It does so in such a way that these faithful ones come to life in our mind, helping us to see them as real people who faced challenges as </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">they </span><span class="font8">served Jehovah. The book also draws les-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What will we consider at the Congregation Bible Study starting the week of October 19? sons from those accounts to help us make personal application today.—Heb. 6:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Features: The book includes a time line and maps to help us determine when and where each character lived. Additionally, each chapter has a feature entitled “To Think About . . . ,” which will help us to meditate on the accounts and apply the practical lessons we have learned. The book is also richly illustrated with colorful, detailed, and carefully researched artwork, which helps bring the accounts to life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> How You Can Benefit: The opening letter from the Governing Body encourages us with these words: “Use your imagination; get your senses involved. Try to feel what those Bible characters felt, to see what they saw. Compare how they reacted in a given situation with the way you would likely have responded.” Of course, to use our imagination does not mean to speculate wildly but, rather, to picture what the inspired account says and to empathize with the people involved. Doing so requires time and meditation. (Neh. 8:8) If the lesson begins in the middle of a chapter, the conductor will start with a 30- to 60-second review of the previous lesson. One or two questions may be asked as a concluding review if the lesson does not include the feature “To Think About . . .”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> We live in a world that seeks, every day, to erode or weaken our faith in one way or another. This book—as well as the ongoing series in The Watchtower on which it is based—is a gift from Jehovah to help us strengthen our faith. (Jas. 1:17) Let us take full advantage of it by attending the Congregation Bible Study regularly and having as full a share in commenting as possible while </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">we st</span><span class="font8">udy this publication together!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Teaching With the Good News Brochure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As discussed in the July issue of </span><span class="font8">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font9">one important tool in our teaching toolbox is the brochure </span><span class="font8">Good News From God! </span><span class="font9">Cited scriptures are not quoted so that householders can enjoy learning directly from the Bible itself. While many of our study publications are written in such a way that the reader can learn on his own, this publication was designed to be discussed with an instructor. Therefore, when we offer it, we should try to demonstrate the study so that the householder can see how thrilling it is to learn </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">good</span><span class="font9"> news from the Bible.—Matt. 13:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. How is the Good News brochure designed?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font8"> On the Initial Call: </span><span class="font9">You might say: “I’m here because people are concerned about where this world is heading. Do you think conditions will ever improve? [Allow for response.] The Bible contains good news that can give us hope. Here are some of the questions that the Bible answers.” Hand the householder the brochure, and invite him to choose a question from the back cover. Then demonstrate the study using the first paragraph of that lesson. Another option is to ask the householder an interest-arousing question based on a lesson </span><span class="font8">you </span><span class="font9">chose and then demonstrate how the brochure can help him find the Bible’s answer. If that lesson has a corresponding video on jw.org, some publishers play it during their presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font8"> How to Conduct the Study: </span><span class="font9">(1) Read the numbered question in bold print to help the householder focus on the main point. (2) Read the paragraph that follows. (3) Read the italicized scriptures, and use tactful questions to help the householder to see how the scriptures answer the numbered question. (4) If there is another paragraph under the question, repeat steps 2 and 3. If a video matches the question and you have not yet played it for the householder, do so at some point in the discussion. (5) Finally, ask for the householder’s answer to the numbered question to make sure he understands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Get familiar with this valuable tool. Use it on every appropriate occasion. Before each study, think about the student and the best way to reason with him, using the scriptures in the lesson. (Prov. 15:28; Acts 17:2, 3) As you gain experience and skill, you may very well view this brochure as one of your favorite tools to use in teaching </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">peop</span><span class="font9">le the truth!</span></p></li></ul>

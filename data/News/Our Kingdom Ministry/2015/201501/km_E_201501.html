<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Responding to an Irate Householder</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">Why Important: Many that we meet in the ministry are polite. However, Jesus prophesied that some people will hate us. ( John 17: 14) Therefore, it should not surprise us if we encounter an irate householder. When this occurs, we want to respond in a way that pleases the one whom we represent, Jehovah. (Rom. 12:17-21; 1 Pet. 3:15) Doing so will likely prevent the situation from escalating. It will also give a witness to the householder and any observers, making them more inclined to listen the next time Jehovah’s Witnesses visit.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>How to Do It:</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font10"> Maintain a calm and friendly demeanor. This will help defuse the situation. Do not take the householder’s reaction personally. (Eccl. 7:9) He may be upset because of personal problems or because you happened to call at the wrong time. Even if he is irritated by our message, often this is because he has been misled.—2 Cor. 4:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font10"> Reply with mild and gracious words. (Prov. 15:1) Did you wake him up or interrupt him? Although we do not apologize for our work, you could humbly apologize for calling at an inopportune time. Is he angry because of an untrue rumor that he has heard about us? If so, you might say: “I can understand why that would upset you. However, it seems that what you have heard about us is not accurate. May I explain?” Does he object to one of our beliefs, perhaps regarding disfellowshipping or blood? You could say: “I understand. Others have expressed the same concerns. May I show you from the Bible the basis for that teaching?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font10"> If the person is highly agitated, it may be best to take your leave without trying to reply. If he asks that Jehovah’s Witnesses not visit him again, you can assure him that his wishes will be honored.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font10"> Have practice sessions during your family worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font10"> After leaving an irate householder, discuss with your partner how you might have responded in a better way.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">Song 20 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Keep Progressing as a Minister</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Christians should progress as ministers. That is why Jesus gave his followers progressive training in the preaching work. (Luke 9: 1-5; 10:1-11) It is also why Aquila and Priscilla took Apollos into their company and “explained the way of God more accurately to him.” (Acts 18:24-26) For the same reason, Paul encouraged the experienced evangelizer </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Timo</span><span class="font10">thy to continue applying himself to his</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What examples from the first century indicate that we should progress as ministers? </span><span class="font10">teaching, so that his advancement would be “plainly seen by all people.” (1 Tim. 4:13-15) No matter how long we have been slaving for the Lord as publishers of the good news, we need to continue sharpening our preaching skills.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Learn From Others: One way to hone our skills is to learn from others. (Prov. 27: 17) Therefore, pay attention when fellow publishers give their presentation. Ask for specific suggestions from effective preachers, and listen carefully to what they say. (Prov. 1:5) Are you unsure about how to make a return visit, start a Bible study, or engage in some other aspect of the ministry? Take the initiative, and ask your group overseer or an experienced publisher for training. Remember, too, that Jehovah’s holy spirit can enhance our abilities, so ask for it regularly in prayer.—Luke 11:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do not get offended if you receive a suggestion for improvement, even if it is unsolicited. (Eccl. 7:9) Like Apollos, accept the help with humility and gratitude. Doing so shows wisdom.—Prov. 12:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Progress Glorifies God: By way of illustration, Jesus encouraged his followers to progress as ministers. He compared himself to a vine and his anointed followers to branches. He said that the Father cleans every branch bearing fruit “so that it may bear more fruit.” (John 15:2) Just as the owner of a vineyard desires the branches of his grapevines to be more productive, Jehovah wants us to continue growing in our ability to produce “the fruit of our lips.” (Heb. 13:15) What is the satisfying result when we make progress as an evangelizer? Jesus gives us the answer: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit.”—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. How can we learn from others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How should we react if we receive a suggestion, perhaps unsolicited?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. What powerful reason did Jesus give for progressing as an evangelizer?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Why Depart Promptly?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">When we meet for field service, we are among our brothers and it is normal to want to converse. However, once the meeting ends, we should try to depart for the territory promptly. Our preaching work is urgent. (2 Tim. 4:2) The longer we delay, the less time we will have for the ministry. We will have plenty of opportunity to enjoy upbuilding association with fellow publishers as we work with them in the ministry. Our departing for the ministry without lingering shows industriousness as we slave for Jehovah and his Son. —Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Use jw.org in Your Ministry —“Become Jehovah’s Friend”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">The “Bible Teachings” section of jw.org has a feature for children called “Become Jehovah’s Friend” that includes songs, videos, and activities. Have you used this feature in your ministry? If you are studying the Bible with a parent who has young children, why not show it to him? This may move him to explore other areas of our Web site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While distributing Kingdom News No. 38, one brother met a woman who began reading the tract as soon as he handed it to her. She had several young children who were curious about the tract. The brother briefly discussed its contents and pointed out our Web address on the back. Since the woman showed interest, he took the opportunity to play one of the Caleb videos for her and her children, using his mobile device.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister told a workmate with young children about our Web site and the information it contains for families. The woman looked up jw.org along with her children. Later, she told the sister that her children were going around the house singing “Preach the Word,” one of the songs from “Become Jehovah’s Friend.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Become familiar with this feature of jw.org, and download one of the videos, songs, or activities to your mobile device. Then you will be ready to use this section of jw.org in the ministry. What a valuable tool to help us slave for the Lord!—Acts 20:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“Do you think it is more reasonable to believe that God created life or that life began by chance and evolved? [Allow for response.] Our personal beliefs about how life began can have a major impact on how we view the future. For instance, notice the thoughts of one evolutionist. [Read the quote on page 29 from William B. Provine.] On the other hand, those who believe God created all things have a bright hope for the future.” Refer to paragraph 4 on page 29, read Psalm 37:10, 11, and offer the brochure.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Recently a brother was asked, “Do you believe you have the only right religion?” He replied: “Qt course I do. If I didn’t think so, I would join another.” Then he went on to explain kin</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">dly what the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses are</span><span class="font13"> and the Scriptural basis for them. He was following the admonition to l^make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper, and d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eep respect.</span><span class="font13">&quot;. —1 Pei. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Daily, there are opportunities to give a reason for our hope. At work, fellow employees may wonder why you do not engage in their degrading conversations. At s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">choo</span><span class="font13">l, teachers or fellow students may ask why you do not celebrate holidays. Neig</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hbors </span><span class="font13">may inquire as to why you go to meetings so often.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Delightful are the words found at Psalm 24:3-5: “Who may ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, and who may rise up in his holy place? Anyone innocent in his hands and clean in heart, who has not carried My soul to sheer worthlessness, nor taken an oath deceitfully. He will carry away blessing from Jehovah and righteousness from his God of salvation.” Yes, Jehovah wants in his intimate association those who are clean and innocent, those who have not been leading a double life by taking a deceitful oath. It is a joy to see that multitudes of Christian youths today fit that description. They are a real credit to Jehovah and his organization. Their moral purity makes them beautiful in the eyes of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Is it easy for young people to be morally clean today? No. Daily there are challenges that must be faced. There is a worldwide epidemic of unclean influences and immoral behavior. What can you do to protect yourself? There is a need to develop a strong relationship with Jehovah. mally. An excellent Biblical example is recorded at Acts 17:2</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">2-31. N</span><span class="font13">otice how the apostleT’auTskillfully established a common ground at the outset and how he maintained it throughout the discussion.

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As you go from door to door during the month of January, look fo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">r a </span><span class="font13">common </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ground</span><span class="font13"> to establisKdiscus-sions.

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Congregations that have any of the 192-page books designated for use in this campaign will offer them for a contribution of 5Qt,_eash. When offering such publications, highlight specific information that focuses on God’s Kingdom. For example, you may want to feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Worl</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">d Government-hook.</span><span class="font13"> On pages 9 to 13, it describes the world envisioned at Revelation 21:4. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life Does Have a Purpose</span><span class="font13"> discusses very similar </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT YOU MUST DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Since a strong relationship with Jehovah involves heartfelt appreciation for Jehovah's qualities, you need to learn what he is really like. This requires an earnest study of his Word along with Bible-based publications. Like Timothy, you need to be “nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching which you have followed closely.” (1 Tim. 4:6) Such study will help you see “the pleasantness of Jehovah.” (Ps. 27:4) The more you learn about him, the closer you will be drawn to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Developing such a relationship requires time and effort. Paul told Timothy: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:15) If you are not yet baptized, then work toward dedication and baptism. Since we are near the end of this system, we should be concentrating on “what sort of persons&quot; we ought to be in “deeds of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1989 &quot;GODLY DEVOTION&quot; DISTRICT CONVENTION</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The expression “godly devotion” refers to reverence, worship, and service to God, with loyalty to his universal sovereignty. The prime example of godly devotion is Jesus Christ. He was the one man to manifest godly devotion perfectly under severe conditions down to his death. (1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 7:26) As followers of Christ, we must strenuously train if we are to display godly devotion. This entails enduring opposition as Jesus did. (2 Tim. 3:12) Training with godly devotion as our aim “holds promise of the life now,” namely, spiritual health, satisfaction, happiness, and a purpose in living. It also holds out to us the promise of life that “is to come.” (1 Tim. 4:7, 8) Therefore, such training is not for our materialistic gain. Rather, as a result of it, we are content with basic provisions as we serve Jehovah.—1 Tim. 6:6-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Though persecution and hardship may come, true Christians need not fear, for “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.” (2 Pet. 2:9) He admonishes them to be identified by “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion” in order to survive the judgment of Jehovah’s day. (2 Pet. 3:10, 11) Would you like to learn ways to strengthen your godly devotion so as to remain loyal to Jehovah in the difficult days ahead? Much helpful counsel and encouragement regarding this will be presented at the three-day “Godly Devotion” District Conventions planned for the United States branch territory this summer. Plan now to attend and partake of the fine spiritual refreshment to be presented.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Following the Service Meeting for the week of January 2, the elders will post on the congregation’s information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list covering the district convention to which your congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats, food, literature, and rooming accommodations for everyone. As you make your plans to be in attendance, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so they also can attend every session. (Gal. 6:10) The program will start at 10:20 a.m. on Friday.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font16">As soon as—but NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses of the motels, their agreed-upon rates, and the phone numbers, you should phone the motel of your choice and make reservations, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention. Doing so will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases have been greatly reduced, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of rooms. One night’s DEPOSIT will be required at all locations in order to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make your reservations. Do not make reservations at more than one motel or at motels that you do not intend to use. (Matt. 5:37) MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD THE ROOMS OR EXTEND THE SPECIAL RATES WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your reservations, you should notify the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available for other delegates. If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list, and so on. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregation with revised lists as long as necessary, deleting motels that have been filled and including additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font16">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all of those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font16">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publ</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ishers consider the needs of those in </span><span class="font16">full-time service, the-elderly, t</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">he infirm</span><span class="font16">, the^leaf; and perhaps .ot</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">hers</span><span class="font16">, which may include t</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">aking such ones</span><span class="font16"> with them. Publishers may care for such ones in other ways also. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17,18) Of course, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">to provide room-</span><span class="font16">that time. The secxeiary-should—then s</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">peak with the Congregation Servic</span><span class="font16">e Committee to see if it is possible for the co</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ngregation</span><span class="font16"> to </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">assis</span><span class="font16">t these persons to care for their own rooming accommodations. </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">If not,</span><span class="font16"> then he may gi</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve them</span><span class="font16"> a copy of </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">theSpecial Needs Room Reques</span><span class="font16">t form.

Upon receipt of this list, use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> YOUR COOPERATION NEEDED: </span><span class="font16">The smoothness and success with which this rooming arrangement functions depend on the cooperation of everyone involved. (Compare Genesis 6:22.) Unless everyone cooperates by using ONLY the motels on the list, the Society may have to discontinue the present rooming arrangement. Thus, we are asking every</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font16"> to co</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">operat</span><span class="font16">e with the Society’s rooming arrangement so as to avoid major difficulties that we are experiencing in our negotiations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">Because a nu</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">mber of complaints</span><span class="font16"> have been received, it is also ne</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">cessar</span><span class="font16">y to make the following requests:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1) Do not make reservations before the congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list from the convention or try to do so for the next year while attending the current convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2) Do not make reservations with motels not on the list or accept a higher price than what is quoted for a motel on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3) Do not make reservations at more than one motel and, after arriving, check each one and then take the best one, canceling the others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4) Do not reserve rooms for others without giving names and sending the deposits for each room immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">5) Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is never more than four or five people, including children. To do otherwise is dishonest. (Remember, you are paying a rate based upon no more than four or five persons in the room.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">6) Do not check in before 1:00 p.m. or whatever is the motel policy. (You may check in after the program that day, since your deposit guarantees your room.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">7) Do not cook or heat food in the room unless it has a kitchenette for that purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">8) Do not get food on floor, walls, beds, or linens.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">9) Do not allow children in hallways, elevators, or swimming pools without parental or guardian supervision with them. Do not use the swimming pools after their closing time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">10) Do not take any linens, including towels and washcloths, away from the motel.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>10</sup> Because of violations in these areas, the Society will be asking the Rooming</span></p>

The convention organization is working hard to save our brot</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">hers as mucTFexpense'as possible</span><span class="font16">, so it is in the best interests of all for everyone to </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">cooperate fully</span><span class="font16"> with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of goodquality accommodations and </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">yet give preference to the motels that coope</span><span class="font16">rate. </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">Our aim</span><span class="font16"> with this arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">The information board should be kept neat and attractive. It should be large enough to accommodate the necessary items outlined herein.

We recommend that the presiding overseer, or someone under his direction, check the board periodically to make sure that the items posted are current, appropriate, and neat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> To acquire k</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nowledg</span><span class="font13">e and grow in wisdom, we must diligently </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">study </span><span class="font13">God’s Word.

We also need to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">meditate</span><span class="font13"> on theHistory of Jehovah’s dealings with his people. Jehovah generously grants knowledge and wisdom to those who sincerely seek him. Through the years, by means of his organization, he has provided an a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">bundance of publica</span><span class="font13">-ti</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">dHS~</span><span class="font13">that~cover many flelds of Bible knowledge.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VALUE OF OLDER PUBLICATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> During January and February, any of the 192-page books published prior to 1980 may be used. There is a wealth of information in these publications. They can be of real spiritual value to people. (See Matthew 5: 14-16.) So during these two months, let us endeavor to p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">lace all the older </span><span class="font13">publications our congregation may havtTin stock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The importance of getting these publications into the hands of people can be seen by considering the experience of a person who received a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">gift </span><span class="font13">copy of one of the older books from his wife, who was a Witness. Up to</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Whenever the way is opened up to give a reason for the hope in us, we want to take advantage of it. Whether young </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">or old,</span><span class="font13"> we sho</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uld be </span><span class="font13">able to give </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">soUh'd, clear, persuasive </span><span class="font13">reasons for'our faith.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Do not under</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">estimate the power </span><span class="font13">of God’sWoxd. Since these older publications highlight Bible truths, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pre</span><span class="font13">s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ent them</span><span class="font13"> with a positiv</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e attitude.</span><span class="font13"> Of course, you will want to make sure that the older books you offer are in good </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">conditio</span><span class="font13">n. If the books are damaged or the pages have turned </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">yel</span><span class="font13">low, they should no</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t be offered</span><span class="font13"> from house to house, since this could detract from the message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">• <sup>6</sup> If your congregation does not have any 192-page books designated for use in this campaign, then you may feature any-o</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">thor 192 page pub</span><span class="font13">lic</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ation</span><span class="font13"> for a contribution of $1.00. After considering Revelation 21:4 with the householder, you may want to read paragraph 3 on page 184 in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font13"> book or call attention to the box on page 25 in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font13"> book as a means of tying in the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> May we all enjoy a productive ministry by sharing knowledge from God’s Word with these older publications! This can work to the eternal welfare of those to whom we witness.</span></p>

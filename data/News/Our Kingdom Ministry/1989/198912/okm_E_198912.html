<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Imperfect and sinful as we are, how can we ward off calamity that could befall us as a result of the way we direct our life? (Eccl. 11:10) Is it possible even for inexperienced youths to avoid calamity? Happily for us, the answer is yes. Jehovah is well aware of our need for direction, and he has lovingly provided counsel and guidance to help both young and old alike pass safely through the mounting difficulties that mark these last days.—Ps. 19:7; 119:9; 2 Tim. 3:1.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> For more than a hundred years, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> has been championing the cause of Kingdom truth.

Its companion magazine </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">also adv</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ocates the cause of trut</span><span class="font11">h.

What can we do to get these magazines into the hands of more people?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The first step is to know the contents ofTfie magazines. This means read</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing them</span><span class="font11"> as soon as they are received and then </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">talking about</span><span class="font11"> the articles wit</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">h others in the congrega</span><span class="font11">tion. This will assist us in zealously offering the magazines to others and in maintaining a positiv</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">e attitude</span><span class="font11"> as to their value.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The next step is to s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">et aside time </span><span class="font11">each week fo</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">r offering</span><span class="font11"> the magazines to others.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> While in the door-to-door magazine work, you may find that </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">many </span><span class="font11">people are not at home. But you can help their children keep on the pathway leading to life, parents must periodically readjust the think</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font11"> of their offspring. This callsTor patience and skill, along with Jehovah’s rich blessing.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Parents cannot entirely shield their children from bad influences. But how can a child’s mind be fortified? By (^bringing him up in the mental-regulating of Jehovah-UEph. 6:4) Among other things, this involves family study, spiritual and moral guidance, he</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">althful after</span><span class="font11">school activity, appropriate discipline, and good parental example.</span></p></li></ul>

This response in support of theocratic increase has been heartwarming.—1 Thess. 4:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Regional Building Committees have also experienced Jehovah’s blessings. Currently, 65 Regional Building Committees are operating in the United States. Hundreds of projects involving construction of new Kingdom Halls or renovations of existing buildings were completed last year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The brothers serving on the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Regiona</span><span class="font13">l Building Committees are to be </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">enmmpndp</span><span class="font13">ri for the diligent efforts put forth to meet the growing demand for Kingdom Halls. The S</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ociety has provided guideline</span><span class="font13">s to assist in reviewing construction plans. Thus, these co</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">mmittees</span><span class="font13"> are in a fine position to assist the local elders in </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">plann</span><span class="font13">ing a Kingdom Hall that will be modest and functional and that will wisely use dedicated resources. It would be good for bodies of eld</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ers to weigh all fa</span><span class="font13">ctors carefully, benefiting to the full from the observat</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ions of </span><span class="font13">the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">experienced elders</span><span class="font13"> appointed to serve on the Regional Building Committees. —Luke 14:28-30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THERE IS MUCH MORE TO DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> While many Kingdom Halls have already been constructed, there is much more to be accomplished in order to keep pace with theocratic increase. Some of the newly constructed Kingdom Halls alre</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ady </span><span class="font13">have three or four congregations meeting in them. This means that soon another hall will be needed to accommodate the growth in these areas. Many other congregations are patiently waiti</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng for funds</span><span class="font13"> to become available to care for present needs. Our continued support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is obviously needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> It is Scriptural to give financial support. The Hebrew word translated “contrib</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ution” means “sacred portion.</span><span class="font13">” (Ex. 25:2, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reference Bible,</span><span class="font13"> footnote) Christians correctly desire to contribute their time, energy, and material possessions for advancing</span></p></li></ul>

We do not enrich Jehovah with qur contributions to his work, but in this way </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">we show our love for hi</span><span class="font13">m, and he bl</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">esse</span><span class="font13">s those who contribute voluntarily.—1 Chron. 29:14-17; Prov. 3:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 8112: “For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.” All can be encouraged to set aside something regularly according to their ability and desire. (Compare 1 Corinthians 16:1-4.) Tertullian wrote of the early Christian congregation: (“Every man once a month brings some modest coin—or whenever he wishes, and only if he does wish, and if he can; for nobody is compelled; it is a voluntary offering.” jll</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nlike </span><span class="font13">many religions today that pass a collection plate to demand contrib</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ution</span><span class="font13">s, all material offerings in the Christian congregation are voluntarily given from the heart. (2 Cor. 9:7) In this regard the December 1988 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdo</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">m Mini</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">stry</span><span class="font13"> commented: (^“Many congregations and circuits have assisted regularly by p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">assing resolutions</span><span class="font13"> authorizing that funds be contributed to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. . . . </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Even th</span><span class="font13">ough a congregation follows this procedure, a Society Kingdom Hall Fund contribution box conveniently located in the Kingdom H</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">all will enable in</span><span class="font13">d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">i</span><span class="font13">viduals desiring to do so to make voluntary contributions to the fund.”yWhen acknowledgments of past contributions are read to the congregation, all are reminded of the share they may personally have.</span></p></li></ul>

Your generous support of this arrangement and the volunteered time and skill of thousands who have assisted with the construction and renovation of Kingdom Halls are sincerely appreciated.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Another congregation said:' When we formed the isolated group in May 1985, we began meeting in the home of a sister.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> We have the record of what was accomplished in Nehemiah’s day.

Nehemiah 4:6 says “the people ^continued to have a heart for working.” J&gt;o today, under the direction of the faithful and discreet slave, great construction work is being accomplished, and Jehovah’s modernday organization has “continued to have a heart for working.” We join you in praying for Jehovah’s rich blessings as we endeavor to keep pace with theocratic increase.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Attendants are to extend a warm greeting to all who come to the meetings. Their duties include seating latecomers, recording attendance, maintaining order and security, and caring for the ventilation of the Kingdom Hall. Attendants should be friendly, responsible brothers who take the initiative in caring for their responsibilities.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font11"> pp. 63-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Attendants should be alert to the needs of new persons, make them feel welcome, and help them to find seats. All in the congregation should be ready to help new ones get acquainted and feel welcome. When guiding latecomers to available seats, attendants should endeavor not to disturb those already seated. At times they provide new persons with the magazine being studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Maintaining order during the meetings is essential. Since we encourage parents to bring their children to the meetings, there will be some disruptions at times. But when children</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is strongly recommended that only qualified brothers correspond with male prisoners. Qualified sisters should write to female prisoners.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When interest is shown by prisoners, it is best to turn the names and addresses of such ones over to the congregation in the area of the particular institution.

<p><span class="font11">In areas where security is a problem, attendants should be assigned to protect against vandalism or disturbances by opposers. If someone inside the Kingdom Hall tries to disrupt the meeting, he should be asked to leave. If he refuses and persists in causing a disturbance, the elders may contact the authorities. (Elders have additional written direction that will be helpful to them in such a situation.) In some areas it may be necessary for assigned brothers to check the Kingdom Hall parking area during meetings.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font11"> 11/84 p. 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To Youths</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> This modern age has proved to be a very difficult time for young people in general. Yet, centuries ago a man inspired by God wrote: “How will a young man cleanse his path? By keeping on guard according to your word.” (Psalm 119:9) Indeed, direction based on Jehovah’s Word is benefiting thousands of young people today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> After reading one of the “Young People Ask ...” articles in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font11">a young man said: “I used to date regularly just because I thought it was the thing to do. I thought nothing of marriage. Then I read your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine. It changed my values for the better. I stopped dating until I am ready to marry.” He obviously benefited from the practical counsel given. Now young people have easy access to a valuable source of Scriptural information that has been published in the form of a new book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Questions Young People Ask —Answers That Work.</span><span class="font11"> What can you do to make it available to young people in your territory or youths in school?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE AN INTEREST IN YOUNG PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Persuading young people to appreciate the value of Jehovah’s Word can be challenging. (See Proverbs 22:15.) However, the apostle Paul said: “To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews.” (1 Cor. 9:20) Similarly, helping youths find and appreciate worthwhile spiritual direction requires that you understand young people and their problems. You need to think in terms of what interests young people and what their problems are in school or where they live or work. When witnessing to youths, this understanding should be reflected in your introductions, your comments, and your questions. The table of contents in the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font11"> is an excellent source of ideas on what to talk about. By being familiar with these subjects, you will have insight into what many young people are thinking about today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT YOU CAN SAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When going from house to house, observe where there are children. Explain that you are doing a public service to help people cope with everyday problems. In these homes you may be able to speak with the children themselves. Point out an example of the practical counsel found in the book. Keep in mind that your goal is to help them see the truthfulness of Psalm 119:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When you speak with a youth, be friendly and treat him with dignity. After an initial greeting, you may say: “I am engaging in a public service to help young people like you cope with the problems they face in this community. Do you ever find yourself being urged to do something you really don’t want to do? Or are you inclined to do things at times just because of what others are doing and not because of your own preference? Do you ever wonder how you can cope with such peer pressure?” After his response, open the book to chapter 9. Then say: “Please notice what this new publication says on page 77. [Read an appropriate paragraph. ] Do you think a study of the Bible would help youths to cope with this problem? [Allow fqr a comment.] Note what the Bible says at Psalm 119:9. [Read.] This book shows you how the Bible can help young people cope with difficult situations, such as those listed in the contents. [Hand him the book.] It is yours for the contribution of $1.50.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> If you are a publisher still attending school, follow the suggestions given in the August 1989 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> You will have many happy rewards as you do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah “does not desire any to be destroyed.” (2 Pet. 3:9) This includes youths. However, many young people will not survive Armageddon. May our efforts to preach to youths effectively result in the salvation of a good number of young people, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

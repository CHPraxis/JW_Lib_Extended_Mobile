<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Worship the Giver of Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 3:4—Jehovah is our Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 4:11 —He deserves our full devotion.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Appreciate <sup>v</sup> Our Grand Creator</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As we observe the creation around us, there is no doubt in our minds that a Creator exists and that he is very much interested in our future. (Rom. 1:20) The book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life —How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font11"> has been instrumental in sharpening our appreciation for the Creator. It has also helped us explain to others just how life came to be.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> After reading the book, one individual with a science background described it as the finest book he had ever read for building appreciation for life. A college professor stated: “I have never before seen such a well-presented argument for creation.” Obviously, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book has been a fine tool in helping many appreciate our Grand Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE ADVANTAGE OF</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> During the month of September, we will again have the privilege of offering this book in the field ministry. In addition to our regular house-to-house ministry, we can offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book while engaging in street work and when witnessing informally. We can offer it to workmates, schoolmates, relatives, and others with whom we come in con</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gaining Joy Through Increased Magazine Placements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s great universal organization is noted for its productivity. By means of Jesus Christ, Jehovah has developed an earthly organization that is also characterized by willing, productive workers. (Ps. 110:3; Matt. 9:37, 38) When we give attention to the quality as well as the quantity of our ministry, increased joy is sure to result. (Luke 10:17) This is particularly true as we brace up our minds for increasing our personal distribution of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Magazine distribution is one of the principal ways in which the Kingdom message is spread abroad. Although this continues to be true as the preaching work expands, it has been noted that in some areas magazine placements are decreasing. How can this trend be remedied? What are some essentials we can keep in mind that will enable us personally to place more magazines?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A POSITIVE APPROACH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A first step to increased placements is: BE MAGAZINE CONSCIOUS. This objective is more easily tact. Do your Bible students have a copy? If not, why not see that they get one? Do you have a magazine route? It may be that these people would like to have a copy. Take advantage of every appropriate occasion to offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book this month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Many young ones have been successful in placing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book at school. Have you tried carrying a copy of the book with you to school? When those who are curious ask questions, you will have opportunity to witness to them. Some publishers have found success doing street work just outside college campuses and have had good discussions with many of the students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">USE THE TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book offer goes well with our Topic for Conversation, “Worship the Giver of Life.” In presenting the book, you might say: “Many people are interested in knowing how life got started. Have you ever wondered about that? [Allow response.] There are different opinions about the origin of life. Let us consider the Bible’s reasonable explanation. [Read Hebrews 3:4.] So logically every building or house we see around us today had a designer and a builder. Obviously, the much </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1} </span><span class="font11">attained when we are regular readers of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> ourselves. Once we are acquainted with their contents, we want to use every appropriate occasion to present them to the public. For most of us, every Saturday offers a fine opportunity to share in distributing the magazines from door to door. Many congregations set aside a time for midweek magazine activity to accommodate publishers who are not able to work in the field service on Saturday. Some may find that evening witnessing affords excellent opportunities to offer magazines from house to house. Street work, store-to-store activity, informal witnessing, and magazine routes are all fine ways by which we can share in distributing magazines. In regular house-to-house work, the latest magazines may be presented when the current offer for the month is refused. Being alert to do so can bring us joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A second suggestion for increasing magazine placements is: KEEP IT SIMPLE. Some publishers have</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">apparently talked themselves out of magazine placements by giving long presentations. Other publishers have used the Topic for Conversation when engaging in the magazine work. However, this is not recommended. When encouraging wider magazine distribution, the December 1,1956, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> stated: “A short, to-the-point presentation is best when offering magazines. The object is to place many copies. They will do their own ‘talking.’ The Society suggests a half-minute to a minute presentation, a well-worded statement of one point discussed in the magazine being offered.”</span></p>

Discuss Ephesians 6:18, 19, showing that Paul asked the brothers to pray that ability to speak would be given him. We need to pray similarly for ourselves and for one another. Discuss need to schedule time for preparation, both as individuals and as family groups. (1 Cor. 14:40) Some have practice sessions with newer ones. Then, while working with these newer ones in the field ministry, they discuss the various situations experienced. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(sg</span><span class="font11"> p. 39 par. 3; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">qm</span><span class="font11"> studies 44, 45) Use the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book in dis-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Next: BE VERSATILE. Prepare more than one presentation. Then as you encounter varying circumstances, you will be able to speak with people of all sorts and tailor your presentation to their interests. This advance preparation often leads to increased magazine distribution and greater joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> One final suggestion: SET A PERSONAL GOAL. You may recall this was stressed in the insert “Magazines Point the Way to Life,” which appeared in the March 1984 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> You may wish to strive for an average of one magazine for each hour you are in service for the month. Your personal goal should be</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">cussing introductions that fit the local territory and ways to handle conversation stoppers that are often heard. If you are having difficulties with some aspect of the ministry, arrange to work with experienced publishers and pioneers, inquiring specifically about the area in which you would like assistance. Preparing to serve Jehovah in the field is a joy. We are all busy and may find it difficult to set aside time, but even a few minutes thoughtfully spent will result in much improvement. Encourage all to prepare well for their ministry. Sm&gt;^156concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">a reasonable one, considering your individual circumstances and the time you are able to spend in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> By means of his visible organization, Jehovah continues to provide what we need to increase our share in the ministry. We have exciting, colorful magazines with which to work. Now our own individual effort in cooperating with the congregation arrangements for magazine distribution enters the picture. Since such activity glorifies Jehovah, we will experience the deep-seated joy that comes with an increased share in the ministry with the magazines.—John 15:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Special cassette subscription forms are being supplied to congregations, and these may be obtained from the brother handling subscriptions. The completed form should be returned to him for forwarding to the Society doubt find it helpful to use variations on the suggested topic to prevent their presentation from becoming routine. Various circumstances may make it advisable at times to use a topic different from the one suggested in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SOURCE MATERIAL FOR PRESENTATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When we feel a need to vary the Topic for Conversation, where can we get other ideas to use? Past issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> will be helpful. The publication you are offering also may be used as the source of your topic for conversation. Select a picture, a scripture, or a chapter theme and make a brief presentation to arouse interest. Try to get the book into the hands of the prospective reader so that he will look at it for himself. You may be surprised to see how easy it is to make the placement in this way. Later, when making the return visit, you can go into more detail. So keep the initial presentation relatively short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> All of us should continue to ask Jehovah for “the tongue of the taught ones” so we will know how to teach those we meet in our territories. (Isa. 50:4) It is our sincere desire to use the Topic for Conversation effectively. Lives are at stake. —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Boldly Witnessing in Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Boldness is necessary in presenting the good news. This is especially true when witnessing in business territory. Some publishers are hesitant to work business territory. But this may be due to lack of experience. Or it may be an area in which there is a need to ‘muster up boldness.’ —IThess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers have obtained good results witnessing in business territory. One circuit overseer reported that in nine mornings of working business territory, a total of 177 books were placed. More could have been placed, but supplies simply ran out. You too may have success if you make the effort to share in working business territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Being successful often depends upon our attitude. Some publishers are inclined to think that witnessing to storekeepers would be extremely difficult. One publisher who took this view said: “I expected that the response would be negative. However, to my surprise, the reaction to the Kingdom message was just the opposite. They were genuinely polite and friendly and almost always accepted the magazines.&quot; Yes, those who share in working business territory speak of it as a fruitful work that brings blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Elders, especially the service overseer, should take the lead. It may be beneficial to prepare special territory maps of heavily concentrated business areas. In other areas, the business places can be worked along with the residential territory. Be sure not to overlook shops, offices, factories, and so forth. The elders may see fit to select qualified publishers to work concentrated business territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Those who participate in this work should be neatly dressed and strive to be brief and to the point when contacting businesspeople. Presentations that are no more than a minute or so in length are most appropriate. Selecting days and times that are less busy is important in getting better</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN SAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> When working business territory, we could feature magazines, the current literature offer, or tracts. Our approach and the offer may vary according to the circumstances. When offering the magazines we could say: “Since it is often very difficult to find businesspeople at home, we are making this effort to contact you today. In the latest issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font11">there is an article entitled [give title] that contains information that personally affects you. We feel you will enjoy reading this article as well as the others. We offer </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font11">along with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> for a contribution of only 50e.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> This month we are featuring the publication </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </span><span class="font11">When offering this publication in business territory, you might say: “As a businessman, you know that much thoughtful effort is required to succeed. Could blind chance have succeeded in bringing about life and the universe? This book offers scientific proof that God created life. It also shows God’s thoughtful purpose in creating man. During this month we are offering this book entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life —How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font11"> It has much to say about life and what the future holds for mankind. We are leaving it on a contribution of $3.00.” (Small-size book is $1.50.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our diligent efforts to reach people with this lifesaving good news. There is a vital need for thoroughness in our witnessing activity. (Acts 20: 24) Since it is often hard for us to find businesspeople at home, we should take advantage of opportunities to speak with them at their place of work. Though working business territory may be challenging, we can be successful if we ‘muster up boldness to speak the good news of God.’</span></p></li></ul>

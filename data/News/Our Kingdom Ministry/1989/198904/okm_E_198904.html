<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Renew Zeal by Applying </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Suggestions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Christ Jesus is the perfect example of a zealous preacher of the good news. His earnest desire to do his Father’s will and his keen interest in people prompted him to show personal concern for others. His ministry was vibrant, and he got results. The ministry refreshed him. He considered it to be “food&quot; that sustained him. (John 4:34) He imparted words of salvation to others while accomplishing the work that his Father commissioned him to do. This gave meaning and purpose to his life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The apostles and other first-century followers of Christ Jesus imitated his zeal for the ministry. Even though severely persecuted at times, their zeal could not be dampened. (Acts 5:28-32; 8:1, 4) The same is true today. The good news is being preached in virtually every corner of the earth by individuals who follow the example of Jesus Christ. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, they are ever “zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If we lack zeal, our work becomes perfunctory, and our personal involvement becomes superficial. As a result, we may no longer find joy in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP NEW ONES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> With the Memorial celebration fresh in our minds, April is a logical time to help new ones to realize that sharing in the field ministry is an excellent mean</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">s for showing tha</span><span class="font12">t they rightly esteem Jesus’ sacrifice. Yes, it is a necessary way to demonstrate how much we appreciate what Jehovah and his Son, Jesus, have done for us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Do you conduct hom</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">e Bible stud</span><span class="font12">ies with a view to preparingstJidfinis for the field ministry? They need progressive help and encouragement in order to develop appreciation for this Christian responsibility. Explain to your students the importance of field service, and demonstrate how it is done. You will find the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Doing God’s Will</span><span class="font12"> helpful in this regard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When a Bible student has made., substantial progress(gnj'shows a &lt;le-sire to help fulfill Matthew 24:14, it would be beneficial to review what is stated nn pages 98 </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">and~9y</span><span class="font12">oi the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Uur Ministry</span><span class="font12"> book.

<p><span class="font12">our service. If we find ourselves in this position, we need to look for ways to renew our zeal and to accept the challenges the field ministry presents. The July 15, 1988, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article entitled “Pay Constant Attention to Your Teaching” highlighted practical suggestions to help us to strengthen or renew our zeal in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHALLENGES WE FACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In many parts of the world, there is very little new or rarely-worked territory. In metropolitan areas, it is not uncommon for congregations to work their territory once a month or even once a week. This can present a challenge since many householders already know who we are and oftentimes attempt to stop the conversation before we can make a presentation. Perhaps they complain that ‘a Witness was here just last week.' Many of our neighbors are not at home, or we may find that the people in our territory are apathetic. All these things can be discouraging. But have you applied the suggestions presented in paragraphs 4-7 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Preparefor the Written Review</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> for December 1988 took note of the new arrangement for written reviews in the Theocratic Ministry School. These reviews will take place three times a year—at the end of April, August, and December. Although a little more individual effort will be required, increased benefits will be reaped by those participating. As the previous article mentioned, a printed review sheet with space for filling in the answers will no longer be provided for written reviews. However, printed questions will be included with the April, August, and December issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> Having these sheets early will give each one the opportunity to research specific information so as to be thoroughly prepared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When looking up cited information on which the printed questions are based, do not mark or write on the question sheet, since you will use this sheet of questions for taking the written review. Remember that only the Bible is to be referred to during the written review. Your personal notes or other references are not to be used at that time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> During the time allotted for the written review, you will need a separate sheet of paper for writing down your answers to the questions that call for an expression in your own words. Try to give specific information, and be brief. Since you will have prepared in advance, this should not be too difficult. When the answers are given by the school overseer, you will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Give Close Attention to Personal Organization</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “If you want a job done, give it to a busy person.” The reasoning behind this saying is that a busy person is usually well organized and can therefore accomplish more. All of us have 24 hours to use each day. Whether we squander that time or we use it wisely often depends on our personal organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There is always “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) We have meetings to attend and the field ministry to share in. But preparation comes before these. In other words, we need to spend time studying so that we can effectively “make disciples” and incite others “to love and fine works,” as we have been commanded to do. (Matt. 28:19; Heb. 10:24) The ordinary things of life, such as secular work, shopping, eating, cleaning, traveling, attending school, and sleeping, all have their place. Some time, too, may be spent in recreation. Fitting everything into its proper place presents a challenge we must meet. How can this be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Jesus said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33) Obviously, Kingdom interests should have the first priority when it comes to the use of our time. If we were to schedule our time the way we budget our money, the hours we set aside for Christian meetings, family Bible study, and such theocratic activities as the field ministry and personal study would not be used to pursue other interests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Into every schedule must go the necessary things of life. Time is set aside for doing secular work to support oneself and one’s family. Eating and sleeping, as well as giving personal attention to the needs of one’s family, must be included. High on the priority list of elders and ministerial servants is the time they spend preparing for and carrying out theocratic responsibilities. Why not sit down and make such a schedule, and see if there are nonessential items that are higher on your priority list than they should be?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEPING A SIMPLE EYE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When Jesus was discussing the activity of his followers, he noted: “If, then, your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright.” (Matt. 6:22) WTrat would be involved in this? Basically it means keeping one’s life uncomplicated. There are many distractions that can steal one’s time. Television is one of these. In some homes, the television set is turned on in the morning and left on all day. A person may sit down to watch a program of short duration. But then he finds that time he had originally planned to use for personal study or with the family slips away as he continues watching other programs. How easy it is to waste an entire evening with nothing worthwhile being accomplished! Many do not know when to turn the TV off. If you have this problem, you may decide it is best not to turn the television on. Hobbies, a form of relaxation for some, may also end up taking away time that was set aside for more important matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Engaging in sports activities, attending sports events, or watching them on TV can swallow up precious time. Husbands, wives, and children do well to see that they are not robbed of time they could use to study and associate together. All of us must be careful not to complicate our life with excesses in sports or recreation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> A serious problem can result if we allow secular work to encroach on priority time. Some may find themselves so absorbed in their work or so concerned with the prospects of financial advantages that they no longer have a place in their schedule for meetings, the field ministry, or their family’s spirituality. (Eph. 5: 15,16) It is good to ask ourselves, ‘Who is it that would really take delight in my selling to secular interests time I have already dedicated to the worship of Jehovah God?’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">WAYS TO USE TIME EFFECTIVELY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Organizing one’s life for the most effective use of time calls for having spiritual goals and a clear set of values. This is the key to setting daily priorities. Do not procrastinate. If you have set aside time to do a job, use it for that purpose. Set deadlines for yourself. Strive to study certain material in ample time to make ■ use of it in the field ministry or at meetings. Do the same thing regarding everyday tasks around the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Practice making use of time that would otherwise be lost. For example, when you must wait for others, use that time well by reading, writing letters, or accomplishing some other essential task. If you find yourself waiting in line, you may be able to strike up a conversation that will lead into giving a witness. Another essential for all is to get sufficient rest and relaxation so as to stay healthy and alert. This will enable you to work more effectively. Illness brought on by a lack of necessary rest or sleep can keep you from giving proper attention to things of high priority in life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPROVING PERSONAL ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> In the business world, much time and effort are spent just planning how to accomplish a given task. A good businessman finds it costeffective to organize workers and material before producing a given product. He realizes that if the necessary workers and materials are not available when and where they are needed, much time and money can be lost and he will not realize a profit. We, however, have far more noble motives for organizing ourselves. These include our desire to maintain a fine relationship with Jehovah, be effective in making disciples, and reach our goal of everlasting life. It is necessary, therefore, to make sure that we have available to us the right tools at the right time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> For instance, we have five congregation meetings each week. The material for these meetings is based on several different publications. Are these publications readily available? Is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> issue we are studying that week set aside, or is time spent searching for it? And what about other needed publications, such as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> the songbook, a Bible, and the publication we are studying at the Congregation Book Study? It is good to have a designated place for these items and keep them there when they are not being used. In this way, we can quickly find the appropriate publications when we prepare for either field service or meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> Elders and ministerial servants especially need to be mindful of their personal organization. With so much to do, both secularly and in the congregation, “the more important things” can sometimes be forgotten or pushed to the side. (Phil. 1:10) Using the suggestion of maintaining a list of priorities can be truly beneficial. Have you tried this? One brother has such a list and reviews it before every meeting. In this way he accomplishes much and can see to it that the necessary work of the congregation is done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> Elders should have a good system for keeping track of congregation correspondence. Paperwork can sometimes be confusing and cumbersome if it is not organized properly. It is good, therefore, to take a few minutes regularly to sort out papers that need to be kept or passed on to someone else and to discard those that can be destroyed. If you have letters in your possession that need to be circulated to other elders, be sure to move them along quickly. Designating a place in your briefcase or perhaps putting correspondence in a separate envelope or folder can help you to keep track of letters and other material needing attention. In this way, important paperwork will not be lost or delayed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION—A SLAVE, NOT A MASTER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> After reviewing your schedule, determine how much organization you need. We do not want to become fanatical perfectionists, overorganizing our personal lives to the point where there is no room for variation. Remember, we are all individuals and we each have a unique set of circumstances. Some of us are single, some married. What may work for one family may not work for another. Personal organization ought to take into consideration our individual and family circumstances. Exercise discernment and be flexible in line with Bible principles that will serve to guide you in having a successful schedule.—See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">of September 15,1988, pages 28-30; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> of December 8, 1987, pages 24-7; and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> of December 22, 1965, pages 9-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> In recent years, simplification through following principles of good order has brought about improved efficiency in the operation of Jehovah’s earthly organization. Some may feel they have methods that work better for them personally. They would like the Society to encourage others to use such methods, but often these have been considered and discarded because they are not organizationally practical. In the interests of unity and efficiency, then, it is wise to follow the approved organizational procedures, using ways and methods that are understood and used by others who may be affected by your work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> Jehovah is a God of order and peace. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) He has a set time to accomplish his will and purpose. (Acts 1:7) Through his Word, he has lovingly outlined what should concern us as imperfect humans. By means of direction from Jesus Christ through “the faithful and discreet slave,” Jehovah provides helpful instructions on how to accomplish the most important work being done today. (Matt. 24: 45-47; 28:19, 20; Eccl. 12:13) So by following Scriptural admonition found in the Society’s publications, including the timely reminders set out in this insert, we can become better organized for fully accomplishing our ministry. —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Satan is attacking families today, doing his best to destroy them. Christians know this only too well. How sad it would be for children to become involved in sexual immorality, drunkenness, drug abuse, or other wrongdoing! Some have actually seen their sons or daughters drift away from Jehovah, being caught up in worldly thinking and desires. (Prov. 10:1; 17:21) At the same time, many young people have stayed clean and have kept themselves busy in Jehovah’s service. Their course of conduct has brought honor to God and joy to their parents and others. (3 John 3, 4) What has made the difference? In many cases it was the determination of parents and children alike to use to the full the defenses provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> At the “Divine Justice” District Convention, attention was given to the defenses parents and youths need today. Some of these were dealt with in the symposium “Disciplining in Righteousness Within the Family Circle” and the talk “Moral Cleanness Is the Beauty of Youth.” Do you remember this information, and have you applied it personally and in your family?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> An important defense is for fathers to understand fully Jehovah’s requirements for the head of a household and to recognize the need to rely on Jehovah for direction. If a family head is to teach his family Bible principles, he must first know them himself. But just knowing is not enough. Application of these principles must be made if the family is to derive the full benefit from them. A dedicated father should lead the family in a spiritual program of prayer, study, and sacred service. (1 Tim. 5:8) If he is to expect his wife and children to respect his authority, he must demonstrate joyfulness in his obedience to God and His organization. (1 John 5:3) When a father imitates Jehovah by dealing with his family in a warm, loving, and consistent manner, he gains their respect, and they will be more inclined to follow his example. This will bring praise and honor to Jehovah.</span></p></li>

It was not a mechanical question-and-answer routine, but the parents aimed at reaching the hearts of their children with the truth. You sisters may particularly recall how the mother was most supportive of her husband, indicating submissiveness and thus setting a good example for the children. —Eph. 5:21-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILDREN—WHAT DOES JEHOVAH EXPECT OF YOU?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Just as your parents are under attack by Satan, so are you. What is your defense? Obedience to Jehovah and to your parents. In the convention talks, fine suggestions were given to help you. Do you recall them? One point you may remember is that you cannot ride into the new world on your parents’ coattails. In other words, you must make the truth your own. Your parents feed and support you. They have been doing so for years. But as you mature, it is expected that you will take on spiritual responsibilities. Jehovah expects you to do what you know is right. (Eccl. 11:9) If you have learned that Jehovah’s way is right, then it is up to you to have the good sense to follow it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> As you grow older, the challenge to remain morally clean becomes more persistent. There is a worldwide epidemic of unclean influence, and you are faced with it every day. Your defense lies in loving what is good and hating what is bad. (Ps. 52:3; 97:10) Associate with those who love Jehovah. Read what is upbuilding. Watch what is wholesome. (Phil. 4:8) If tempted, remember the outcome of the young man in want of heart. (Prov. 7:6-27) Be guided by Jehovah in your thoughts and actions, and you will remain safely on his side.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’ Yes, parents and children alike must remain alert to the dangers that surround all of us. By using our defenses to the full, we can come off victorious in the fight and be privileged to praise Jehovah eternally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “How I wish I had my </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font12">book!” Has this thought crossed your mind while endeavoring to respond to a Scriptural question encountered in the field ministry or while witnessing informally at work or school? Those who have become familiar with the features of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book and who carry it with them have found that they can count on it for help at the right time. What about you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Since the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book was released in 1985, almost every issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> has provided excellent suggestions on its use. Can you recall some of the settings in past Service Meeting parts that highlighted the versatility and value of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book? There have been demonstrations showing how it may be used by parents to help their family prepare for field service, an elder assisting a youth who may be attracted to the world, and stronger publishers assisting those who are in need of encouragement, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font12"> 6/86 p. 2; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 7/86 p. 2) One article encouraged young ones to use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book in preparing spiritually for school, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font12"> 8/87 p. 2) Other articles have given practical suggestions on how to use it in each feature of our field ministry and how to adapt its use to varying circumstances, such as when working territories with high-security buildings.—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 4/86 p. 3; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 12/87 p. 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ARE WE USING IT TO THE FULL?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If we are to use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font12">book effectively, we must first become familiar with its contents. Then we must put forth the effort to use its </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">above-mentioned </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Millions have already been gathered into the “great crowd” of “other sheep,” and millions more continue to respond to the good news of the Kingdom. (Rev. 7:9; John 10:16) However, presentations that were successful in the past may no longer arouse interest in our territories. We need to be alert to the type, quality, and effectiveness of our presentations and to be ready to make necessary adjustments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Addressing this subject, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> gave some interesting recommendations on how to improve our ministry. It suggested ways of giving a thorough witness when we have to deal with apathy, with people in often-worked territory, and with suggestions. Have you tried adapting a suggested introduction to the current Topic for Conversation? If you use the second suggestion listed under “Kingdom” on page 12 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book and make brief reference to Revelation 21:3-5, you could then logically bring up the subject of our current Topic for Conversation, “Whom Shall We Worship?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> By using material from the section on “Conversation Stoppers,” we can be more successful in overcoming initial objections. Why not give thought to how you might respond to a potential conversation stopper. For example, when a person says “I’m not interested,” you could use the fourth suggestion on page 16, refer to Revelation 14:7, and then point out that this scripture awakened you to the need to identify and worship the true God. Try it. Others have had good success using expressions such as these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Indeed, many are the blessings that can come from using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book. If we set aside time to prepare fresh approaches and introductions that will appeal to our particular audience, we will be more enthusiastic about getting out into the field, even in territory that is frequently covered, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font12"> 3/86 p. 4) Why not take the time needed to review some of the past articles that offered suggestions on how to use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book effectively?—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 3/87 p. 4; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font12"> 10/88 p. 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> May Jehovah bless your efforts to the full as you seek to open up to others “the magnificent things of God”! (Acts 2:11) Then they may join in saying to Jehovah, as did the psalmist David: “To me how precious your thoughts are!”—Ps. 139:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">householders that complain. Are we applying these suggestions, adapting our presentations to the needs of the territory? Are we taking advantage of the tools available to us to do this? Following the suggestions offered will help us to become more personally involved in the ministry. As we deliberately incorporate what has been outlined, we are stimulated mentally and become absorbed in the ministry. Thus, our zeal is renewed and intensified.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> In view of present world conditions, it is quite evident that the great tribulation is drawing closer. This underscores the urgency of our message and the need to shine as a ‘light to the world.’ (Matt. 5:14, 16) Let us be diligent in applying the suggestions we have received and thus intensify our zeal for the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

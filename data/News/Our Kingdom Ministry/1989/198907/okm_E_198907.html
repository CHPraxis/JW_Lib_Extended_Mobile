<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s people have shown that they are ‘hearing' and ‘observing’ what is written in the prophecy of Revelation. (Rev. 1:3) Their zealous efforts in helping others see the urgency of our times are evident in the all-time peaks experienced in April 1989. What are some of these peaks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 804,518. This is almost 24,000 more than we had in April 1988 and 7,414 more than our previous peak in August 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 18,673,721. How encouraging that nearly 1,700,000 more hours were devoted to Kingdom activity than in April of last year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits: 5,767,946. An increase of 5.5 percent or 302,130 more return visits than in April 1987, which was the month of our previous peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: 573,244. This is 3,150 more than we had last April, our previous all-time peak month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliary Pioneers: 120,979. What an outstanding peak, reflecting the efforts being put forth to herald the Kingdom hope! This is a 20-percent increase over our previous peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We are confident that Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus, are pleased as we extend ourselves in Kingdom service during “the Lord's day.” (Rev. 1:10) May we help thousands more to become part of the “great crowd&quot; as the increase continues in these momentous days.—Rev. 7:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Serving With a Complete Heart</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> David set a fine example of serving Jehovah with a complete heart. His lead had a profound effect upon the entire nation of Israel. It was with a complete heart that they too made voluntary offerings for the building of Jehovah's temple. —1 Chron. 29:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Why is serving Jehovah with a complete heart so important now, just as it was in ancient Israel? Simply stated, Jehovah favors those who serve him with a complete heart. —2 Chron. 16:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPORT KINGDOM WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We can serve with a complete heart today by supporting the work of Kingdom preaching. (Matt. 24:14) Giving financial support to this work is important, but using our strength, time, abilities, and power of speech in spreading the good news to others is of even greater value. (2 Cor. 9:7) Are you experiencing the joy that comes from serving with a complete heart?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> During July we are encouraged to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings Benefit Our Children</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In the nation of Israel, even little children were included in meetings for worship. (Deut. 31:12) Likewise today, the congregation meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses benefit the children.—Ps. 148:1,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Of course, children may be easily distracted. They need to be taught to listen attentively to what is said. They also need help in understanding some of the material presented.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE FOR MEETINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Proper training at home will help children to appreciate the privilege of assembling with others to worship Jehovah. They should be helped to understand that obedience in this remake heartfelt appeals to righteously disposed people as we talk about the Source of true peace and security and present one of the brochures included in our literature offer. In this way, we can show that our heart is complete toward Jehovah and direct meek ones to the real Source of peace.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COULD YOU PIONEER SOON?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Can you take advantage of the additional daylight hours to increase your field service time? July may be an excellent month for you to increase your activity in the field so as to qualify for pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Now that summer is here, many are building up their field service with a view to becoming regular pioneers at the beginning of the new service year in September. If you would like to do that and pioneer service is within your reach, go to Jehovah in prayer and ask for his help and direction. (Prov. 16:3) Talk to the elders about your prospects for regular pioneer </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font13"> 3) gard brings benefits. Even very young ones can be helped to understand that Christian meetings are for them too.—Ps. 133:1; Isa. 48:17; Matt. 19:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It is helpful if children have their own Bible, songbook, and other study literature to use during the meetings. Parents should help younger ones prepare at least a part of the lesson for each meeting. (Heb. 10:23) This can be done in harmony with the child’s ability to understand and participate in the meetings.</span></p></li>

After the application is approved and signed by the Congregation Service Committee, it should be mailed to the Society by the early part of August. By forwarding approved applications early, requests for retroactive appointments can be avoided.—See August 1986 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font13">insert, paragraphs 21-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">• An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1990 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There are various ways that we can crea</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">te opportunitie</span><span class="font13">s to give an informal witness. During a lunch break, while waiting in an office7~of when using public transpor</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tation, </span><span class="font13">some brothers make it a practice to tnagazin</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">es or book</span><span class="font13">s. By be</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing aler</span><span class="font13">t to the r</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eaction</span><span class="font13"> or any interest shown by those ‘seated nearby, a conversation may result if we </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">simply share a </span><span class="font13">t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hought</span><span class="font13"> from what we are reading.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>J</sup> Usually it is not difficult to start a conversation with someone on a general matter of local interest. If we </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pray for Jehovah’s help</span><span class="font13"> and then make the effort, we can enjoy fine results. A very s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">imple way to</span><span class="font13"> give a brief and informal witness is to offer one of our tracts. This is especially </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">prac</span><span class="font13">t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ical</span><span class="font13"> in situations where there is n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot much time</span><span class="font13"> for a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">conversatio</span><span class="font13">n. Tracts are small and easily carried but contain a powerful message. Most of us could use them more frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">USE </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">REASONING</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ A practical aid for all features of Kingdom preaching is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font13">book. Many of the introductions 6n pages 9-15, as well as the information under “Conversation Stoppers&quot; on pages 15-24, can be adapted to informal witnessing and be used to start conversations. For example, • The Society is now accepting orders for reprinted </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> bound volumes in English for the years 1975 through 1979. Congregations and individuals desiring to have these volumes for their library should determine the total number of volumes they need for each year and submit their requests through the congregation. The total quantities should be entered on the Literature Order form (S-14) and SUBMITTED DURING THE MONTH OF JULY 1989. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List,</span><span class="font13"> paragraphs 7-10.) Please do not place orders for years other than 1975 through 1979. Since the Society will not stock these reprinted volumes, we urge all to consider the matter carefully and place orders for the 1975 through 1979 volumes that are needed. Later orders will only be filled as long as existing one introduction on pag</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e 11</span><span class="font13"> says: “Did you read this m The newspaper t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">his weeK</span><span class="font13">'r isnow appropriatp citn-ping.) What do you think . . . ?” How simple, and yet how effective for starting a conversation! Or we could ask if the person has noticed how the news mpHia ha</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">vp</span><span class="font13"> q</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uoted prominent </span><span class="font13">p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eople who use the term “Armaged</span><span class="font13">don&quot; in Feference to all-out nuclear war. We could then ask what he t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hinks Armageddon will</span><span class="font13"> mean rrr mankind. The material on page 9 can be adapted to the conversation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Whenever we engage in informal witnessing, it is good to allow the other person the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">opportunity to expres</span><span class="font13">s himself. We should be courteous and r</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">espectfu</span><span class="font13">l at all times, it we </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">listen </span><span class="font13">c</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">arefully</span><span class="font13">' to what the other pSrsun has to say, we may be able to determine wh</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">at his interests</span><span class="font13"> are and then speak words that will whet his spiritual appetite. (Prov. 25:11) If possible, we should obtain the names and addre</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">sses of those who show interest </span><span class="font13">so further contact can be made to cultivate the interest. Likewise, we should also ke</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ep a record of the tim</span><span class="font13">e s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pent</span><span class="font13"> in informal witnessing so this can be reported accurately.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Using the House-to-House Record</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.” (Rom. 15:19) These words of the apostle Paul indicate how diligent he was in carrying out his commission to preach, teach, and make disciples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We want to be just as thorough in witnessing within our assigned territory. The time we are living in is most critical—lives are at stake. Failure to warn the people will incur bloodguilt. (Ezek. 3:18, 19) Like the apostle Paul, we want to be able to say that we are “clean from the blood of all men.” (Acts 20:26) How can we be more thorough in working our territory? Proper use of the House-to-House Record form can help.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN NOONE IS HOME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A complete and accurate record of not-at-homes is indispensable in covering our territory effectively. This is true whether the territory is seldom or frequently worked. So we must be persistent in trying to reach someone at every home. When there is no response, we should make appropriate notations on a house-to-house record. Then we should be sure to return and try to give a witness to someone in that household.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> To reach those who were not at home on the initial call, some have</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">meetings. Very young children may enjoy noting the number of times God’s name, the Kingdom, or a certain Bible subject is mentioned and something said about it. Children who are a little older could be assigned to list the scriptures that are read or quoted. Whatever the assignment, the children will benefit the most if they are commended for their effort. They may also be given the opportunity later to comment on points learned or to relate how they enjoyed points presented at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> All children who can read should be encouraged and helped to have a personal program for privately reading the Society’s publications. Depending on the child’s ability, it may include reading through the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories, Great Teacher,</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font13">books, as well as selected articles in the magazines. Such a program should eventually enable a youth to keep up with all the current theocratic publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DRESS AND DECORUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’Often, visitors are impressed when they see the respectful way used their house-to-house record, calling back right after door-to-door activity the same day. Or they try calling on a different day or at a different time of the day. Many find that calling in the evening brings good results. Shut-ins have had success making telephone calls or writing letters when repeated visits to certain homes are unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN INTEREST IS FOUND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When you find an appreciative ear, keep a record. Write down the person’s name, address, and any other information that will help in following through on interest shown. If you do not contact the interested person again after several tries, perhaps a change in the day or time you call would help. Do not be quick to give up on someone who has shown interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The apostle Paul set a good example for us. He “thoroughly bore witness” in his assigned territory. Using the house-to-house record properly will help us to bear thorough witness in our assigned territory. And what joy we will have as many more become disciples of Jesus Christ! Thus, we will be able to repeat Paul’s words: “I am clean from the blood of all men.”—Acts 20: 21, 26.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">our young ones are dressed at Christian meetings. It has been observed that the way a child is dressed for meetings usually has a bearing on his attitude and conduct at meetings. When visiting the Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn or any of the branch offices, it is appropriate for children and adults alike to dress as they would for a Christian meeting. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">—om</span><span class="font13"> p. 131.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> The fine behavior of our children at meetings also brings praise and honor to Jehovah’s name. Therefore, parents should recognize that close supervision at meetings is vital. Concerned parents will arrange for the family to sit together during meetings and see to it that their children maintain proper decorum at all times. For additional helpful suggestions, parents can talk to others who are having good success with their little ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> It is our desire for children to share fully in worship at our Christian meetings and ‘incite others to love and fine works.’ (Heb. 10:24) In Jehovah God's arrangement, meetings are for children too.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Keep Watching How You Walk</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The new circuit assembly program for the 1990 service year will begin in September. It will stress the importance of watching how we walk, pursuing the things that make for peace, and avoiding the many pitfalls put in our path by Satan and his hordes, both spirit and human.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Walking in the pathway of righteousness is not becoming easier in these last days. Therefore, the two-day circuit assembly program will provide encouragement and practical counsel to help Jehovah’s people maintain their spiritual balance and prove to be integrity keepers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The assembly theme, “Keep Watching How You Walk,” based on Ephesians 5:15,16, is most appropriate for the development and presentation of the prepared material. Instruction will be given by means of talks, demonstrations, experiences, interviews, and skits. On Saturday there will be opportunity for newly dedicated ones to get baptized. Therefore, those planning to be baptized at the circuit assembly should let the presiding overseer know well in advance so that arrangements can be made for going over the preliminary questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> A highlight of the circuit assembly is the public talk given by the district overseer. The subject of his talk will be “Light Bearers in a Dark World.” This Bible discussion will contain vital information for newly interested people, and it will be encouraging to those who are already serving as ministers of the good news.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Your circuit overseer will let you know when and where your circuit assembly will be held. Make definite plans to attend all the sessions on both days. We cannot afford to miss any part of the program. Jehovah will reward your endeavors by helping you to keep watching how you walk.</span></p></li></ul>

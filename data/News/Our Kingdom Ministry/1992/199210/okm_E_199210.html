<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Solomon declared that &quot;sons are an inheritance from Jehovah.” (Ps. 127: 3-5) They are, indeed, an inheritance of inest</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">imable value</span><span class="font7">. Parents have a Godgiven responsibility to teach, train, and discipline their children. This includes training in the ministry, encouraging the chfidren </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">to speak from the hea</span><span class="font7">rt about Jehovah and the Kingdom. —Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> At what age should parents begin this training? The Bible’s answer is clear: It should be from </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">infancy</span><span class="font7"> (2 Tim. 3:14,15) The earlier the training starts, the greater the likelihood the children will develop a solid, founda</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">tion i</span><span class="font7">n the truth and make the ministry their vocation. This early training will also serve to protect them from worldly thinking and attitudes.</span></p></li>

This has opened the way for them to serve as auxiliary pioneers and even regular pioneers before finishing their schooling. To achieve these goals, they need to be taught to converse with people on a variety of Bible subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Some adults who are inclined to view today’s youth in general as brash and disrespectful may have little interest in conversing with a young person who calls at the door. What might a young publisher say at the door to overcome such a barrier and hold the attention of the adult householder? One young publisher used something like this: “Good morning, my name is____</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am calling on my neighbors today because many are concerned about the future. As an adult, you are surely much more experienced in matters of life than I am. However, here is a scripture that is comforting to all of us.” After reading Revelation 21:3, 4, the conversation could focus on the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Another suggestion is: “Hello, my name is____I am making brief visits in Kingdom hope. Information on “Family Life Today—Meeting the Challenge,” featured in the Octob</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">er 15</span><span class="font7"> issue, will help us start conversations with family members who yearn for relief from life’s many pressures.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> We want sincerely interested ones to receive these valuable journals on a regular basis. When discussing the many benefits of the magazines, try to determine whether the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">person</span><span class="font7"> is genuinely interested. When Initial interest is found, you may decide to deliver a few issues personally as part of your magazine route anZTIn this way cultivate the interest. When you are con</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">vince</span><span class="font7">d that the person is genuinely interested, offer to have the magazines dSivered through the mail as a subscription. If the person agrees, a six-month subscription may be entered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’ We can recommend our journals to one and all. since we are convinced of their value. We have something good, and it is Christl</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ike to share</span><span class="font7"> it with others—Prov. 3:27; Heb. 13:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the neighborhood because I know many adults are concerned about the direction young people seem to be taking today. Sometimes young people display a disrespectful, even rebellious attitude. But I am sharing a scripture that shows how someday everyone will learn to live together in peace.” Then read Psalm 37:11 and comment appropriately. When adult householders hear such sincere expressions by our young publishers, surely many of them will be favorably impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Thousands of young publishers continue to make a fine contribution to the Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking work. They are to be warmly commended. Youths trained from infancy by godly parents readily respond to sincere encouragement to work toward having a fuller share in all features of the ministry. Those in school have the unique opportunity of witnessing to fellow students and teachers alike. Many have enjoyed gratifying experiences witnessing in this special territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> So help the young publishers in your congregation take advantage of the opportunity to serve Jehovah with youthful vigor, praising him from the heart. —Eccl. 12:1.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>INSTRUCTIONS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">During 1993 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi 12], “AU Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot;</span><span class="font7"> (1990 Edition) [si]. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font7"> [sgj, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font7"> [gt], </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> (rsj, and “Bible Topics for Discussion’ as found in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font7"> [’id] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The school will begin with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or by a qualified ministerial servant. This talk will be based on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“AU Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot; </span><span class="font7">or the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook.</span><span class="font7"> This assignment should be delivered as a 10- to 12-mlnute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font7"> of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. Where needed, a theme should be selected. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder or by a ministerial servant assigned by the school overseer. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a 30- to 60-second overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font7"> the information is of value to us. Check </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> issues for further highlight material. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">AU</span><span class="font7"> the assigned verses should actually be read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">withou</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font7">a break.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to sisters. The subjects for this talk will be based on the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font7"> The student assigned should be able to read. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. It is preferred that settings Involve field service or informal witnessing. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistants) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned to a brother or a sister. When assigned to a brother, this should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the brother to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable audience-type setting, the brother may choose to develop his talk accordingly. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S-38a 10/92</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student speaker merits solely a “G&quot; and there is no other speech quality marked “I&quot; or “W,&quot; then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G.&quot; “I,” or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student's next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those giving talks should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font7"> the giving of necessary oral counsel, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than a total of two minutes for counsel and any other brief remarks after each student talk. If the Bible highlights presentation left something to be desired, private counsel may be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PREPARING TALKS: Brothers giving Assignment No. 1 should select a theme where needed. Students assigned the second talk should choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material. Students assigned the third and fourth talks should use the theme shown. Prior to giving the talk, students will want to read over the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font7">material dealing with the speech quality being worked on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TIMING: No talk should go overtime, nor should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Talks No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The one assigned to give the “stop signal&quot; should do so promptly. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically, a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper. The school overseer will consider with the audience the answers to the review questions and concentrate on the more difficult ones, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be given a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 50 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Of course, unbaptized persons whose lives conform to Christian principles may also enroll In the school and receive assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ABSENTEES: All in the congregation can show appreciation for this school by endeavoring to be present at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It is hoped that aU students will view their assignments conscientiously.</span><span class="font7"> If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> After attending this year’s district convention, we are more keenly aware of the need to be light bearers to our neighbors.

<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Our opportunities to bear light were increased when, at the close of the Friday morning session, the new tract entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font7"> was released. The demonstrations on Saturday morning were very helpful in showing how this tract might be used. Along with this, there was an announcement that three other tracts would soon be available.

This full-color, beautifully illustrated brochure will answer many questions people ask, such as: Why does God permit suffering? Will suffering ever end? How do we know that we are in the last days? How will the earth be transformed into a paradise? How may we attain to everlasting life in God’s new world? This brochure will be an excellent instrument for starting new studies.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ To what extent may young children of Christian parents share in the field ministry before they are recognized as unbaptized publishers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christian parents want their children to develop into mature, devoted servants of Jehovah. (1 Sam. 2:18, 26; Luke 2:40) Even at a very early age, children in Christian households should be able to make clear expressions in defense of their Bible-based faith. The spiritual growth of children is accelerated as they accompany their parents in the field ministry from infancy. But it is important for the young ones to be motivated from the heart if they are to enjoy the field service, desire to become unbaptized publishers, and continue sharing in the Kingdom-preaching work. Careful training by the parents is required. (1 Tim. 4:6; 2 Tim. 2:15) Other qualified publishers may assist at times if the parents are in agreement. —See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font7"> pages 99-100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As well-behaved children accompany their Christian parents in the house-to-house work, they learn how to engage in the ministry. But they will not be recognized as unbaptized publishers until they have developed a measure of ability and skill of their own. Christian parents can decide to what extent a child can share in giving a witness as they work together. Children who are not yet recognized as unbaptized publishers should not make calls on their own or accompany other children in field service. Parents can prepare their children for field service and allow them to participate in various ways, such as by reading a scripture, offering a tract or a magazine, or showing the householder an illustration in one of the publications. As a child grows older, he may be able to participate to a greater degree in the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With proper training, young ones learn to appreciate the seriousness of the ministry as they respond to the direction of their parents and conduct themselves in an orderly manner. Parents should not leave their children who are not yet recognized as unbaptized publishers at the meeting for field service, expecting others to care for them. Concerned parents recognize their personal responsibility to supervise the activity of their children. Of course, other responsible publishers may be willing to help out in the training of young children in the congregation who show genuine interest in serving Jehovah in the ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Develop a Motivating Introduction</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Both </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">are useful in planting seeds of truth in the minds and hearts of readers. Therefore, we want to develop effective ways to get these magazines into the homes of people who can benefit from the spiritual gems they contain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> How can householders be motivated to accept and read our magazines? Much depends on how we introduce them. Excellent suggestions for preparing effective introductions are found in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book, pages 9-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> When presenting the October 1 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> you might try using the third suggestion under the heading “Current Events” on pages 10-11 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After introducing yourself, you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “If you could choose, which of the many problems now facing the world would you like to see corrected first?” Listen to the householder's response, and acknowledge his concern. Then you could continue, saying something like: &quot;Consider what the Bible offers as a solution to such problems. [Read Isaiah 9:6, 7.J So the real solution to all mankind’s problems lies in the just rule of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.” Then turn to page 8 and direct attention to the last three paragraphs of the article entitled “The Messiah—A Real Hope?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Two other introductions you could use with the October 1 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">are found on page 11 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font7">book, under the heading “Employ-ment/Housing.” You can express these thoughts and questions in your own words or just repeat what is said in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book. After acknowledging the person’s response, continue by sharing the interesting observation made in the first paragraph on page 4 under the subheading “No Solution?” Then by reading Isaiah 65:21-23, point out the blessings the Messiah’s rule will bring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> If you are using the October 8 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> on “You </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Can</span><span class="font7"> Overcome Negative Emotions,&quot; you might try the third introduction under the heading “Life/ Happiness” on page 13 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book. After tying in Psalm 1:1, 2, you could call attention to an appropriate point in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Likely you will encounter householders who say they have their own religious literature. You can explain that we also have publications for our own use (such as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry)-,</span><span class="font7"> however, our journals are read by millions of people who are not Jehovah's Witnesses. Be sure there is genuine interest before offering a subscription. A tract may suffice if the interest is minimal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’ Paul said at 1 Corinthians 3:6: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” If we want Jehovah to make the seeds of truth grow in the hearts of interested ones, we should give attention to planting these seeds effectively by using motivating introductions.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Concom for Interested Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Above all others, Jehovah has been generous in showing concern for people. Not only has he provided material things in abundance but he has given us the spiritual thin</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">gs we need</span><span class="font7"> an</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">d </span><span class="font7">enjoy. He is so c</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">oncerne</span><span class="font7">d about us that he even examines what is in our hearts. —Ps. 139:237“</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus^was on earth, he followed his Father’s pattern.perfectly in showing concern for others. Remember the man who said to Jesus, '“Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean”? Jesus responded, “I wan</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">t to</span><span class="font7">.” (Matt. 8:1-3) When Jesus saw a widow in_grief, what did he do? He stopped to help her. (Luke 7:11-15) Could you be more alert to show concern for interested ones?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> In imitation of our Father, Jehovah, and his Son, Christ Jesus, we_t&lt;x&gt; must show a personal interest in others. We do this by keeping an accurate house-to-house record. This involves writing down the name and exact address of the interested person along with the subject that was discussed on the initial call. Then, befgre making the return visit, prepare welL_If we left magazines on the previous call, perhaps our return visit can be based on a particular thought expressed in one of the articles. Note how this may be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> If you left the October. 1. 1992, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and focused on the article &quot;Does Mankind Really Need a Messiah?,” you might prepare to highlight Revelation 21:4 and John 17:3 on your return visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For example, after reading Rev-Jelation 21:4, you might ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “How can we be a part of such a world? [Allow response.] Listen to what the Messiah said was needed in order to gain life in a world like this.” Then read John 17:3, highlighting that everlasting life in a peaceful new world can be gained by taking in knowledge of God and Christ. If there is some interest, try to start a study in the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> You may get good response by discussing a selected point from the October 8, 1992, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> on “You </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Can </span><span class="font7">Overcome Negative Emotions.&quot; When making a return visit, you might base your discussion on Philippians 4:6.7-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “What do you believe is the solution to overcoming negative emotions today?&quot; Acknowledge the response and then say: “Interestingly, the Bible outlines principles, that, when applied, contribute to peace of mind and heart-[Draw attention to appropriate points from Philippians 4:6, 7J The Bible points to a time when all will live by Bible principles and there will be no circumstances that bring about negative emotions.&quot; Then highlight other future blessings by considering the t</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ract</span><span class="font7"> </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World, </span><span class="font7">and lead into a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What if the householder already has one of our publications? Why not u</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">se lt</span><span class="font7"> to start a study? If it is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book, turn to the table of contents and ask the householder to select a subject he would like to discuss. You may then start a study by considering a paragraph or two.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font11"> is an outstanding book. Its 133 chapters can incite readers to look intently at Jesus and motivate them to imitate his example. It has been well stated that all the kings who ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this earth as powerfully as Jesus has. Those who look intently at Jesus will certainly be benefited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus taught his disciples about his Father and exemplified the precious qualities of God. Our hearts are moved when we consider Jesus’ superb </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ability </span><span class="font11">as a teacher, his fearless leadership, and his tender compassion. When we recall his sufferings as he gave his life to ransom us, we are moved with appreciation! </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span><span class="font11"> can help people see Jesus this way.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Even when threatened with beatings and imprisonment, the apostles stated to their opposers: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.”l(Acts 4:20) They appreciated the value of Jesus’ works and teachings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The good news about Jesus and his Kingdom is just as important for people today as it was then. Therefore, we shouldselze every opportunity to speak about what we have seen and heard from God’s Word. People are usually in a better frame of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mind</span><span class="font11"> for speaking about religious matters during a hoU-day season, and this opens extra opportunities to witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Youths, Speak at School: Many young Witnesses take advantage of opportunities to witness to classmates and teachers.

It may ta</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ke mor</span><span class="font11">e than one conversation with a person to accomplish this. If Initial interest is11m-itedj we could leave a tract or perhaps a brochure or a magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Our discussions from house to house during December will center on Jesus and encourage people to get to know him better. By featuring thoughts expressed in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book, we can help people see Jesus, not simply,as a historical person, but as God's Son and reigning King of the government that will solve all </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mankind’s problems</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As was stressed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> last month, we want to use our literature wisely.

<p><span class="font11">The result? She placed 35 hooks in one day! Since many minds are turned toward Jesus Christ and thoughts of peace at this time of year, would it not be a good time to let classmates and teachers know how Jesus as reigning King can solve world problems?—Compare Luke 2:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If your refraining from sharing in religious traditions connected with Christmas becomes an issue, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “I do not share in Christmas festivities because such celebrations do not honor Jesus as our only means of salvation and the only one who will bring an end to war and racial problems. [Quote or read Acts 4:12.] Jesus is no longer a baby but a reigning King. This book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The&amp;reaiesLMan Who Ever Lived,</span><span class="font11"> dls-cusses all of Jesus' teachings and miracles and shows how he will bring an end to human suffering.” Then show the illustration in chapter 133, and read the second paragraph on the next page. Show other'points you feel may appeal to the person. If adequate interest is ed? If the person listens carefully, asks questions, or pays particular attentlpn to what we read in the Bible, this may be an indication of sincere interest. Sometimes the householder expresses appreciation for our visits or states he has enjoyed reading our literature. If we show the book and he readily examines it or asks how he might, get, one, this shows genuine interest. If such interest is not evident, we might leave a tract, raise a question for future discussion, and arrange to make a return visit. When returning, we might be able to determine more clearly the extent of his interest.—See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font11">May 1990, page 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’One person who does not always enjoy reading expressed appreciation for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book, saying that it made reading a treat at the end of his day.

Its attractive appearance and the title Itself prompt questions. You might simply ask a workmate;, &quot;Who would you say is the greatest man who ever lived?&quot; Then </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">add</span><span class="font11">: “This book covers in detail the entire life of Jesus, discusses every speecli.he gave, answers questions many ask about his miracles, and gives other interesting details.

This means that the student handling this talk will include explanatory infor</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mation</span><span class="font11"> in his introduction and' ‘conclusion onlj.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s modern-day organization has a history </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">of successfully u</span><span class="font12">s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing tracts</span><span class="font12">. The very name of our legal corporation, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, implies that tracts play a vital part in the dissemination of the good news. From 1881 to 1918, more than 300 million tracts were distributed by Jehovah’s people. Many of those who became part of the remnant of Christ’s brothers during this period were first intro</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">duced to the</span><span class="font12">-truth by means of these early tracts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In 1987 renewed emphasis was placed on the use of small tracts with the release of four colorful ones that have been available since then. It was announced at the 1992 “Light Bearers” District Convention that this series of tracts was to be enlarged with the addition of four more colorful and thought-provoking tracts. They are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed, Enjoy Family Life, Who Really Rules the World?,</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font12"> Are you using all eigh</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">t tracts</span><span class="font12"> to produce beneficial results in your ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Good results come from using the tracts effectively. We will need to familiarize ourselves with each of them. For example, have you read them over ca</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">refully</span><span class="font12"> to get in mind what each one discusses? Have you thought about what type of person each tract will appeallo? Thoroughly familiarizing yourself with each tract will build your confidence in using them in the house-to-house work as well as in many situations where you can give an informal witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use in the House-to-House Ministry: </span><span class="font12">One circuit overseer writes\“I am having fine success by starting most of my discussions with the tract.” Have you tried this approach? Why not use tracts as a means to introduce your conversation? With eight tracts, we now have eight stimulating introductions to choose from. Each tract gives us an opportunity to sta</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rt a </span><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ible study either on th</span><span class="font12">e initial call or on a </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">return visi</span><span class="font12">t.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are other opportunities for using tracts. During a conversation at the door, you may learn that the person has recently lost a loved one in death or that someone in the family is iU. People who experience great sorrow_or who are trying to cope with prolonged difficulties often develop negative emotions and become depressed. How loving it would be to share the encouraging message found in the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed!</span><span class="font12"> You may learn that the person was r</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecently divorce</span><span class="font12">d or that he has lost his empl</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">oymen</span><span class="font12">t. Such experiences can be traumatic and take quite a toll on the family. Use the questions on page 2 of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Family. Life:</span><span class="font12"> “Why are familiestoday bombarded with such serious problems? How can we enjoy family life?” Perhaps these are the very questions that the person has foremost in mind. Even if immediate interest is not </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">appare</span><span class="font12">nt, it is possible that he will read the tract later on.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In some congregations the territory has been worked frequently, and many people already have some of our literature. By using the tracts, we will have an opportunity to discuss something of interest with householders, draw them out, and get them to think about the Kingdom hope. Plant a question in their minds that can be discussed at a later time. Make a return visit, and develop this interest further. In time we may be able to begin st</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">udying with them using a brochure or a boo</span><span class="font12">k t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hey already have</span><span class="font12">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Use Tracts Informally: </span><span class="font12">If we keep tracts within easy reach—in our shirt pocket, coat pocket, purse, or witnessing bag—we can use them on many different occasions, wherever people may be found. Use them when shopping, traveling, or talking to relatives or visitors. Tracts afford us the opportunity to give a brief witness. A tract-is something that does not overw</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">helm a person</span><span class="font12"> but is pointed and tactful. It is more readily accepted than a book or the magazines, since there is not so much to read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Be alert to opportunities to offer the tracts informally at school or your place of employment, at restaurants, at a gas </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">stat</span><span class="font12">ion, and so forth. When making arrangements to take her grandmother to the doctor, a sister made sure that she had some tracts with her. At the doctor’s office, she started a conversation with an expectant mother. After showing the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font12"> to the woman, the sister asked: “Would you like to raise your child in a world like the one pictured here?” She was able to follow up that conversation with a visit to the woman’s house. This led to a number of regular return visits.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, DECEMBER 1992</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Bible Studies Can Be Started With Tracts: </span><span class="font12">One circuit overseer reported that the congregation he was visiting started 64 home Bible studies during the week by using tracts when initially greeting the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Have you tried offering a Bible study on initial house-to-house calls? By using a tract, you may be able to demonstrate briefly how a study is conducted. One sister did this using the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font12"> Pointing to the picture, she asked the householder if she thought our earth would ever be like that. After the householder responded, the sister invited her to read 2 Peter 3:13 and Isaiah 65:17, which are highlighted in the tract. Our sister then said: “These promises are neither a dream nor a fantasy but are actually made in God’s Word, the Bible.” She then arranged to continue the conversation the following week. On the next visit, a number of the woman’s questions were answered and the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font12"> was left. A Bible study resulted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Are you one who is newly baptized or perhaps an unbaptized publisher who is gaining experience in your ministry? If so, you may want to seek out those who are more experienced and ask for their suggestions on using tracts in your congregation territory. We have many examples in the Bible of those who received encouragement and direction from mature ones in the faith.—Acts 18:24-27; 1 Cor. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The Congregation Book Study conductor can be especially helpful in making arrangements for others to give you assistance in using tracts effectively. Parents have the responsibility to help their children make advancement in the preaching work. One young Witness was trained by her parents to offer the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font12"> While with her mother on a Bible study, she offered a tract to the interested person’s husband. The husband was impressed that a young person would have such strong religious convictions. He thoroughly enjoyed reading the tract. Each time the young girl returned with her mother, she shared a scripture or Bible story that she had prepared especially for him. The man now reads the magazines regularly, has shown interest in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font12"> book, and has attended a few meetings. All of this resulted because the parents took time to care for their responsibilities in teaching their daughter to make good use of the tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Use Our New Tracts Effectively: </span><span class="font12">In using the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?,</span><span class="font12"> you could introduce yourself and begin your conversation by saying: “Good morning. We are talking to people about the quality of life today. Do you think the quality of life will improve, or will it continue to decline? [Allow for response.] Some think that what is happening in the world today is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy and that the world’s end is near. What do you think?” After the householder responds, offer the tract and draw attention to the three questions in the second paragraph. Then follow the development of the tract to show how a world has ended before and that this one also will end. As the visit is concluded, arrange for another visit to consider the Bible evidence that the end of the world is near.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Many times we find ourselves in a position to share the Kingdom message with others only briefly, such as at work or at school. At your place of employment, a discussion may come up about recent news items concerning government. You could agree that despite all efforts made by leaders who may be well-meaning, the world has suffered terribly throughout history. Then refer to the bottom paragraph on page 2 of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Who Really Rules the World?</span><span class="font12"> Read the three thoughtprovoking questions. If there is no time for a brief conversation, give the person(s) the tract and make arrangements to discuss these questions at another time or place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> As individuals and families, take time to consider how to present each of these different tracts. Hold practice sessions. How can you use the tracts with the other literature being featured in the field ministry for the month? What appointments do you have coming up where you could take a few tracts along with you? Will you come in contact with someone this week who would benefit from the timely message these tracts offer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> Deep love for Jehovah and concern for people will motivate us to do all we can in making the good news known. Using tracts regularly will help us do that. One young boy, seven years of age, wanted to help his next-door neighbor make it into the new system, so he gave her a tract, and a Bible study was started. It sounds so simple! But do we appreciate this simple approach in our ministry? The next time we leave a tract with someone, it may lead to a Bible study too. If we make wise use of tracts in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, we are certain to experience beneficial results.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">■ Should we telephone the Society to obtain answers to Bible questions or for personal advice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many people use the telephone to do things quickly, but often more than speed is involved. In the world it is common to put priority on per-sonqZ'conyenlence; people avoid exerting themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What a COritrast we And with God’s advice! He urges nsto.seefcfor knowledge, as for hidden treasure, which implies our being willing to exert ourselves. Experience proves that our doing so results in more lasting satisfaction.—Prov. 2:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Such effort is Atting if a question arises as we prepare for a share in meetings or if we face a personal problem. Instead of simply telephoning the Society, we will beneAt by personally doing research in the Bible and our publications, especially the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index, </span><span class="font11">with its valuable Scripture and subject indexes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After we have thus ‘s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ought</span><span class="font11"> for hid treasures,’ we can </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">approach one</span><span class="font11"> of the loc</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">al elders if we still need help-</span><span class="font11">The~elders have considerable Bible knowledge and experience in searching for information. Their balanced help would especially bejittlng.if we need advice about a personal problem or decision, for they are close_to usand our situation.—Compare Acts 8:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If jt still seems that more information is needed directly from the Society, it is usually b</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">etter to send a let</span><span class="font11">ter. The elders may be of assistance too in preparing this. Such a letter will allow time for the reply to be based on adequate research or reAec-tlon, which usually is impossible with a telephone call.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In our field ministry during December. we will feature the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font11"> What will you say to start a timely Bible discussion, and how will you introduce this excellent publication?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Using Our New Tracts: Some publishers have found success in using tracts to discern'a pe</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">rson’s interes</span><span class="font11">t even before offering other literature. How can we be helped to accomplish this? By featuring our new tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Win This World Survive?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After an appropriate greeting, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “We are asking people if they would agree that Jesus Christ was the greatest man who ever lived. [Allow time for reply.] Of course, many men have influenced the course of human affairs, and some have contributed to the progress of the human race, but notice what sets Jesus Christ apart from all others. [Read John 17:3.] No one else has the power to grant everlasting life to mankind. [Turn to page 3j&gt;f the tract.] When Jesus was here on the earth, he described events that would occur prior to the world’s end. But he also encouraged his disciples to rejoice because these events would mean thaf deliverance was getting near.&quot;'After briefly discussing some features Of the sign of Christ’s presence, direct attention to the ba</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ck page</span><span class="font11">, which shows some of the blessings of his Kingdom rule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Using the tract “Will This World Survive?,”apublisher could open topages 3 and</span><span class="font11"> 4 </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Notice these two pictures, one of a plane dropping bombs in wartime and the other of a starving child. [Turn to page 5.] Look at these pictures of an earthquake and of a sick man in a hospital bed. [Pause.] The Bible shows that such terrible things will s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">oon come to an </span><span class="font11">end?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If the person appears to be interested, read Revelation 21:3.4 either directly from the Bible or as quoted in the tract on page 6. Depending on the interest shown, you could highlight additional information. When genuine interest is manifested, you may be able to explain briefly the overall nature of our work, leave the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book, and arrange for a return, visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Lay Groundwork for a Future Visit: Of course, whether we left a tract, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book, or other literature or just had a pleasant conversation, we might say? “The next time I come, I would like to share an Interesting fact with you concerning the city where Jesus was bom.&quot;]Be sure to take careful note of the call and the interest shown.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The Kingdom offers the only genuine hope for mankind.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Interest With Discernment During the Holiday Season</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> December is a month when many of those who have shown interest in our message will likely be busy with holiday activities. Therefore, when following up interest, we will need to be discerning and perhaps be prepared to get to the point quickly, unless the householder shows a desire for a longer conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Give Advance Thought to What We Will Say: We should always have clearly in mind what we want to say. This requires referring to our notes on the previous visit and refreshing our memory as to points covered in the conversation and any unanswered question that was left with the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the above article was used, upon returning we could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “At this time of year, many people are thinking about the birth of Christ. The last time we spoke, I promised to share an interesting fact with you about the city where Jesus was bom. Did you know that the Bible foretold 700 years in advance that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem?&quot; Allow for a response. Then, after reading Micah 5:2, you could say: “That is an amazing prophecy, is it not? While this is an interesting Biblical fact, did you know that Bible prophecies are also coming true in our day?” If the person has time, we could continue the conversation, or if he is busy, we might offer to return and discuss this further with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'If the tract “Will This World Survive?” was left, we might say the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Note what is stated here on page 3, under the subheading ‘The Sign.’ This concerns prophecies that Jesus said would mark the last days. [Consider two or three prophecies with the householder.] Would you say that there is evidence these prophecies are being fulfilled in our day?” If genuine interest is discerned and time permits, you may wish to suggest he examine the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book. Show how chapter 111 goes into more detail with regard to the sign that Jesus gave. If only the tract is left, on the next visit you could lead the discussion into another tract or a brochure such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That Will Bring Paradise</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making AU Things New.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Offering a Home Bible Study: If we leave the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font11"> book with the householder or he already has a copy, it would be good to demonstrate a home Bible study by using chapter 111. We can use a method similar to that used at the Congregation Book Study. If the study continues to progress, we could change over to studying one of the brochures or go directly into the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Let us always be prepared to follow up on all interest. We must be discerning and always endeavor to pave the way for a future visit by raising interesting questions at the end of each conversation. This will help us to be “completely equipped for every good work.&quot;—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>

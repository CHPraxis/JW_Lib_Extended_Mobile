<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Soon, the “Prince of Peace” will establish true peace and security earth wide. Our faith in this Bible promise should motivate us to share it with others. (Isa. 9:6, 7; Mic. 4:3, 4) During the months of January and February, We will be offering any 192-page book published in 1983pr earlier. Congregations that do not. have a stock of such books may offer the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> On page 8 of this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom MtnisTry,</span><span class="font12"> we have presented a number of introductions that you may want to use in the ministry during January. Three transitions that may be helpful in directing the attention of householders to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font12"> book are suggested in the following paragraphs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Transition No. 1: </span><span class="font12">After your introduction, turn to page 13 and say: “Isaiah 9:6, 7 is quoted'word for word from the Bible in this first paragraph. Allow me to read it to you.” Then ask: “Who is the ‘Prince of Peace’?” Allow for a reply, then continue: “This book clearly identifies the ‘Prince of Peace’ and explains</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Accept the Responsibility of Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> There are a number of motivating reasons for sharing as fully as possible in making return visits. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">We want to </span><span class="font12">accomplish thoroughly the work that we have been given to do, even as Paul did. (Acts 20:21,24) If we are thorough in calling back on all interested persons, we will maintain a good «&gt;n-sc</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ience</span><span class="font12"> while striving to accomplish our ministry fully.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Knowledge Makes Us Responsible: </span><span class="font12">'The fact that lives are at stake should move us to be diligent in making return visits. (John 17:3) Our </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">knowledg</span><span class="font12">e of J</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ehovah’s judgmen</span><span class="font12">t and the nearness of Arma</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">geddo</span><span class="font12">n should incite us not only to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">warn</span><span class="font12"> the wicked b</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ut als</span><span class="font12">o to help those who are ‘sighing and groaning because of the detestable things happening on earth.’ (Ezek. 9:4) They </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">need </span><span class="font12">to be brought into association with Jehovah’s visible organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> People need help to understand the truth accurately. (</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Acts 8:30, 31; 18:26) </span><span class="font12">This is another reason for us to accept how he will bring worldwide-peace to the earth in our time. Are you interested in reading it. and would you like to learn more about the promised new world?&quot; Depending on the response, you can determine if the book should be left with the person.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">* Transition No. 2: </span><span class="font12">After reading Isaiah 9:6, 7, turn to page 4 and ask the householder: “What peaceful conditions. do you see in this illustration?” Allow for a reply, then continue by saying: “There is peace among the people and peace with the animals- Some may think that human governments will bring such a peace. But real peacp and security as foretold in the Bible must be God-made, not man-made. Don’t you agree?&quot;&quot;&quot;Allow for a reply, then read paragraph 4 on page jTand explain that this booE”answers many questions about the Kingdom and peace on earth. If the householder is genuinely interested in the Kingdom message and wants to read the book, offer it to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Transition No. 3: </span><span class="font12">In areas where people are inclined to interrupt and not our responsibility to return and “water” the seeds of truth that were sown. How much spiritual progress would we ourselves have made had it not been that someone returned time and again to help us acquire an accurate knowledge of Jehovah and His wonderful purposes?—</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Matt. 7:12</span><span class="font12">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Show Love and Zeal: </span><span class="font12">Making return visits is a fine way to demonstrate pur lovg_f°r people. A bl</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ind brother </span><span class="font12">serving as a regular pio</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">neer</span><span class="font12"> said: “Ever since my baptism, my desire has been to tell others of what I had learned from the Bible. I was happy that my handicap did not prevent me from doing this. ... I learned also to keep ji. ment</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">al record</span><span class="font12"> of each house on the street, and in this way, I was able to make return visits on persons interested in Bible study.&quot;jThis blind brother can truly </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">see with his heart</span><span class="font12">, and he does not hold back from making return visits and expressing his Christian love for others. allow you to finish your presentation, you might use this approach: “May I ask you a question?” If the householder agrees, continue: “Jesus said at Matthew 28:19, 20 that his followers would make disciples of people qfall nations. The question is: Would the whole world have to be converted before, he would rule as the ‘Prince of Peace’? What is your opinion?&quot; Allow for a reply, then say: “The Bible answer to that question is found here on page 21.” Then read paragraph 2 on page_21, and point out how the scriptures cited in this book answer that question and many more about worldwide security and the “Prince of Peace.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> You may have selected an introduction that you like from page 8 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> After reviewing the transitions in this article, you may find one in particular that you will enjoy using. Take the time to practice your introduction and transition before going in field service. Your preparation and your personal conviction that true peace and security will come by means of the “Prince of Peace&quot; and his Kingdom will add to your persuasiveness and enthusiasm in offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">wideSecurity^.^^</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"> <sub>?</sub></span></p></li></ul>

(</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">1 Pet. 3:15)</span><span class="font12"> This not only helps the householder but also fires up our own zeal and appreciation for the truth. Making return visits brings a joy that can be obtained in no oth</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">er way-</span><span class="font12"> ‘ And the quality of that joy need never' diminish. It can be r</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">enewed constan</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">l</span><span class="font12">y by our zealously making ret</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">urn visits</span><span class="font12">. —</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Prov. 10:2</span><span class="font12">2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We must take seriously our respon- </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">C </span><span class="font12">sibility to make return visits. Jehovah’s • people do not hold back what is good from others, and this can be seen by our worldwide activity during the 1991 service year. (</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Prov, 3:27</span><span class="font12">) We made 344,926,952 return visits and conducted 3,947,261 home Bible studies. There were </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">300,945 new disciples</span><span class="font12"> who dedicated&quot; themselves to Jehovah and were baptized. This marvelous increase would never have occurred had it not been for our </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">willingness</span><span class="font12"> to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">accept th? </span><span class="font12">responsibility of making return visits. —1 Thess. 2:8.</span></p>

Stress the Bible principles of honesty, obedience, loving concern for others, and so forth, from the article even if it appears that no one will be using motel rooms.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1992 “Light Bearers” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Conventions have long been an integral part of the lives of worshipers of Jehovah, Ancient Israel assembled by the hundreds-and thousands on special occasions during the year for various festivals, or “holy conventions.” (Lev. 23: 1-36) These impressive gatherings provided an occasion to worship Jehovah God, associate with large numbers of his people, and be taught by him. Conventions today afford similar opportunities and are enjoyed by millions of God’s people. Undoubtedly, most of you shared in the blessings received by the 1,394,432 in attendance last summer at the memorable “Lovers of Freedom” District Conventions held across the United States. Some of you also rejoiced to be among the 15,710 baptized. Now it is time to begin preparations for attending another thrilling three-day gathering—the 1992 “Light Bearers” District Convention. Wi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ll you</span><span class="font14"> and your family be there?—Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The program is being, tailored, to the needs of God’s people, who spread the truth as light bearers worldwide. In these evil days of the conclusion of this system of things, we need the encouragement and motivation that will come from being there to receive the bountiful spiritual blessings in store for us. Be sure to make your convention arrangements carefully and prayerfully^ so that you can be there to enjoy all three days of the delightful spiritual program from the opening song to the closing prayer. Lovingly include in your plans those who may need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they also can attend every session. (Gal. 6:10) The program begins F</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">riday</span><span class="font14"> at 1</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">0:20 a.m</span><span class="font14">. and ends at 5:00 p.m. Saturday sessions begin at 9:3</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">0 a.m.</span><span class="font14"> and close with song and prayer at 5:00 </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">p.m.</span><span class="font14"> On S</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">unday</span><span class="font14"> the program begins at 9:30 a.m. and ends about 4:30 </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">p.m</span><span class="font14">. The following information will assist you with your preparations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Instructions for Obtaining Rooms: </span><span class="font14">After the Service Meeting for the week of December 30, congregations should post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list for the district convention to which the congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. Your cooperation with these arrangements will assist the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient rooming accommodations for everyone at a reasonable price.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What You Should Do: </span><span class="font14">After—NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the motels, you are free to phone.the motel of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, JANUARY 1992 </span><span class="font14">your choice and make reservations. Identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases are greatly reduced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> ONE NIGHT’S DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make reservations. If your deposit is not received.by the motel, your reservations can be canceled at any time. MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD THE ROOMS WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your reservation, you should immediately notify, the motel, making the room available for other delegates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list and so on. Many call the motels closest to the convention, so you may find it beneficial to try some motels farther away, which often have quality rooms at lower rates. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregations with revised lists, deleting motels that have been filled and including additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dormitories: </span><span class="font14">A few conventions also use school dormitories in order to accommodate all of those attending. Usually, congregations will receive information on these a month or so after JLhe first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font14">This provision is only for exemplary publishers, including their well-behaved children, who are app</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">roved</span><span class="font14"> by the Congregation Service Committee. Arrangements to care for persons with special needs should be made by the congregation where they attend. Elders and others who are aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf, and perhaps others. Publishers may extend help by taking such ones with them or caring for their needs in other ways—Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17, 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Of course, the Rooming Department will endeavor to provide suitable rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs if they cannot be assisted by those in the congregation. These publishers may discuss their situation with the congregation secretary. The secretary should consult with the Congregation Service Committee regarding what is needed so that they can work with these persons in securing their own rooming accommodations. If the congregation is unable to render the needed assistance, the secretary may give such persons a copy of the Special Needs Room Request form. Those with special needs are the only ones that should fill out this form. It is to be returned to the secretary and checked for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that qualify them for such consideration. The circumstances are to be EXPLAINED in DETAIL by the secretary in the space provided on the form. All of this should be done well ahead of the convention. The secretary will then forward the form to the Rooming Department. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive,because the Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> Private-h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ome accommodation</span><span class="font14">s are set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford motel rooms but who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Similarly, it is not proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days. These rooms are for the convention period ONLY. Those receiving such accommodations should see that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host and do not damage anything, rummage through the host’s possessions, or enter private areas of the home. If householders experience any difficulties along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the rooming overseer .at the convention, and he will be happy to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Delegates Attending From Outside the Assigned Area: </span><span class="font14">In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Having adequate seating, literature, food, rooming accommodations, and so forth, is based on the premise that the majority of publishers will attend the convention to which their congregation is assigned. However, if for good reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, the congregation secretary can give you the address for that convention headquarters from the list on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then you can write and request a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Your Cooperation Needed: </span><span class="font14">The success of this rooming arrangement depends on the cooperation of all of those involved, including our Bible students. (Heb. 13:17) Thus, we are asking everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement and USE ONLY THE MOTELS. ON THE CURRENT RECOMMENDED LODGING LOCATIONS LIST so that major difficulties we still experience in negotiating with the motels can be prevented. Most publishers are taking to heart the clear direction that has been given in past January Owr </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> convention inserts, and many good results are being experienced. However, it is still necessary to request that everyone PLEASE OBSERVE THE GUIDELINES ON PAGE 6 FOR OBTAINING MOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>14</sup> Violations in these areas make it difficult to negotiate good rate^ and they</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Guidelines for Obtaining Motel Accommodations</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font14"> Do not locate and call motels in the convention city and ask them if they are on the current list or have special rates for the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">B.</span><span class="font14"> Do not accept a higher price for a motel than what is quoted on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">C.</span><span class="font14"> Please do not make reservations at a motel you do not intend to use or at more than one motel with the idea of checking them, selecting the best, and canceling the others. (Matt. 5:37) This is unfair, as it prevents the motels from getting business they could have had and prevents other publishers from using those rooms, for which there is often a critical need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">D.</span><span class="font14"> Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and sending the deposits for each room immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E.</span><span class="font14"> Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based upon the number of persons you AGREED would be in the room.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">bring reproach-on Jehovah’s name and organization. (Col. 4:5) Therefore, the Society will be asking the Rooming Department to check with the motels to determine if any are experiencing such problems and who is involved. The convention organization is working hard to save our brothers as much expense as possible, so it is in the best interests of all to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement so that this provision can continue. The listing gives a choice of good-quality accommodations at motels that cooperate. With this arrangement our aim is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so that they can enjoy the fine spiritual program at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Sign-Language Sessions: </span><span class="font14">As you will note in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> of February 15, 1992, sign-language interpreting will be provided AT_ONLY 16 specific convention cities. NO provision for sign language will be made at any other conventions. This arrangement provides good-quality interpreting and larger groups for enjoyable, upbuilding fellowship. Elders and signers should let the deaf in their congregations know of these arrangements immediately and help them to obtain rooms and attend where the sign-language provision is made by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Note to the Body of Elders</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Please read the Society’s December 15, 1991, convention assignment letter and the first and last paragraphs of the Recommended Lodging Locations list for your congregation during the Service Meeting for the week of December 3.0. After that meeting, post the letter and the list on the information board. NO ONE, INCLUDING THE ELDERS, SHOULD MAKE ANY MOTEL RESERVATIONS BEFORE THIS SERVICE </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">meeting.</span><span class="font13"> In this way all the congregations will receive the information the same week. The congregation secretary should handle convention-related material and announcements on future Service Meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Practical Approach to Preparation for Field Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you sometimes hesitate to share in some feature of the field service because of not knowing what to say? If you do. we are sure you will appreciate the approach being taken in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Beginning with this issue. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font12">will offer an even greater variety of suggestions for presenting the Kingdom message, whether from house to house, on a return visit, or on a Bible study. These should stimulate your thinking on what expressions you would like to use in the ministry. When preparing for the ministry, select a presentation that is well suited to your territory. Next, determine whether you will use the wording that is suggested in the article or you will adjust the wording to fit local circumstances or your own personality. Your presentation may sound more conversational if you expressed it naturally in your own words. Would you like to expand your ministry in some way, perhaps by engaging in some feature for the first time? The detailed suggestions offered may be just what you need to get started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you conduct one of the congregation’s meetings for field service, you should be well acquainted with the material published in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> Have your copy well studied, and draw attention to those suggestions that are most likely to be effective locally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">' All of us enjoy the things we do well. It is our hope that this practical approach will help both the newer and the more experienced publishers to be effective and joyful in their Kingdom ministry.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What is the most imp</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ortant part </span><span class="font12">of. your house-to-house present</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ation? </span><span class="font12">Most of us would agree that it is the introduction. If you are unsuccessful in arousing the householder’s interest within the fi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rst 30 seconds</span><span class="font12"> or so, he will probably terminate the conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What factors should you consider in preparing an effective introduction? Analyze the customs and n</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">eeds</span><span class="font12"> of the people you are likely to meet. Is it customary to exchange </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">oleasantries</span><span class="font12">.~75r&gt; will you be expected to come quickly to the point? Are there m</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">any yo</span><span class="font12">ung cou</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ples</span><span class="font12"> in your area? What are their concerns? Are people in your neighborhood conscious of problems facing mankind in general?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might get them to listen by saying something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Good morning. My name is__I’m</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">' bothered_when I read about people starving and being killed in wars. Are you?” Other questions that may help start a conversation are: “What is_the solution to the world’s problems?&quot; “Do you think anyone can rid the earth of today’s problems?” “Suppose a ruler had qualifications like these mentioned at Isaiah 9:6, 7? [Read and comment on scripture.]”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In some territories, people may show greater concern for their home and family than for global matters such as World peace.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might arouse interest by asking:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “What kind of life do you see for yourself and your family in ten years? The Bible’s view of the future is most encouraging because it foretells the coming of a ruler who will govern by perfect standards. Notice what Isaiah 9: 6,7 says about him.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you live in an area where crime and safety are the topic of the day? Some may lend a hearing ear if you use the first introduction under “Crime/ Safety” on page 10 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font12">book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Hello. We’re talking with folks about the matter of personal safety. There is a lot of crime around us, and it affects our lives.” Then a question such as “What is the solution?” or “Do you think anyone can rid the earth of these problems?” or “What if a ruler had qualifications like these?” may help start a conversation. You could then read Isaiah 9:6,7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> All of us, including young people of school age, can use these simple one-scripture presentations. In fact, you may wish to try one when offering magazines. Remember, our goal is to assess the extent of the householder's interest before offering literature. Do you not agree that such a Scriptural presentation would be a fine way to discern whether our listener manifests genuine Interest? We are sure that many will enjoy using these presentations during January, both when offering magazines and when presenting the regular offer for the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If you make effective use of the first 30 seconds of your visit, both by your demeanor and by your introduction, you will likely achieve the important goal of getting householders to listen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Since true Christians are sincerely interested in others, you might first, re; fer to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">something you learned</span><span class="font12"> about the householder on the previous visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To a person who revealed his concern about crime, you could say:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “The last time we spoke you said you were troubled by the noticeable increase of lawlessness. Do you think that hiring more policemen would solve the problem?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If a person expressed anxiety over recent developments in the world situation, you could say:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “The last time we spoke together you made an interesting point abo</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ut th</span><span class="font12">e lack of peacelh the world.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To a person who is disturbed by the selfishness of others, you could say:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■ “The last time we spoke you made an excellent point concerning the greedi-</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nessweseei</span><span class="font12">n people in general.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Other expressions that have been used effectively include:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">June 1992 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 35, No. 6</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mankind’s Need to Search for God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> During this 20th century, there have been mass movements of population as a result of wars, oppression, and economic pressures. And with faster travel and communication, the world seems to be getting smaller. This has brought various religious groups into closer proximity. Thus, religion is often in the news as affecting the lives of people everywhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Our preaching work has also been affected. It Is no longer unusual to contact people who are of a religious background with which we are unfamiliar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> To help us have a clearer understanding of other religions and their historical background, we have been provided with the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.</span><span class="font8"> It answers hundreds of questions about the basic beliefs of the world’s major religions. We will be using this book in our ministry during the month of June. What subjects from this valuable aid can we highlight to encourage sincere ones to learn more about God?</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Share in Informal Witnessing This Summer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">' Our regular routine in life includes specific periods for talking to people about Jehovah. We set aside time for witnessing formally from house to house, making return visits, and conducting Bible studies. There are many other less formal occasions, though, when we can speak to people about the truth. We refer to this preaching as informal witnessing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Some publishers find many opportunities to engage in this form of the ministry. All of us can endeavor to be alert to such occasions this summer as we travel to and from conventions, take vacations, and visit with relatives. Will you take advantage of opportunities for informal witnessing during this time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Advance Plans: </span><span class="font8">Preparation and forethought will enable us to witness informally in an effective way. In this regard, we are well equipped with a variety of publications to help us accomplish this. In addition to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> One fundamental question that is handled throughout the book is: Does man have an immortal soul that survives his death and goes on to an afterlife? In one form or another, nearly every religion teaches that concept. Other questions addressed in the book are: Is there such a place as hell where souls are tormented? What is the true hope for the dead? Is there one God, or are there many gods? Attention can be drawn to the questions on pages 17-18 of the book. Even when talking with an atheist oranagnostic, questions 4 and 5 may get his attention and perhaps result in a profitable conversation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>S</sup>A11 mankind needs to search for God and to seek his favor now. World events show that Armageddon is coming on apace. It is a time for zealous action. What a privilege we have in urging others to seek Jehovah now, while he may be found! (Isa. 55:6, 7) How does the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font8"> assist people in their search for God? It provides thought-provoking </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> we have several tracts that feature thought-provoking titles to stir interest. There are brochures that appeal to people of various backgrounds and religions. We also have pocket-size books that cover subjects of current interest. Which publications do you feel comfortable using? Give thought to this as a family. Then practice what you will say when the appropriate occasion comes up.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> While on Vacation: </span><span class="font8">An excellent time to witness informally is while on vacation. Are you planning a trip by plane, train, or bus? Then take along a Bible and one of the publications mentioned above. Reading such publications on public transportation often sparks a conversation. If you travel by automobile, think about what you can say when you stop at a filling station or restaurant or while staying at a hotel. For such occasions, you could keep a small supply of tracts handy to give to Information for persons of varied backgrounds. For example, paragraph 26 on page 297 points out to Muslims that true Christianity does not teach the Trinity doctrine. Notice how paragraph 43 on page 229 might stimulate the interest of Jewish people regarding the use of God’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> We have every reason to be enthusiastic about presenting this book. If we are well acquainted with its contents, we will find opportunities to arouse the Interest of sincere people of many religious backgrounds. May we show zeal for this service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah is a generous and merciful God. How gracious his invitation to learn about him! There may be many more who will become praisers of Jehovah. During June, with the aid of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God, we </span><span class="font8">will be able to help many in Christendom as well as those from nonChristian and godless backgrounds to start worshiping Jehovah “with spirit and truth.” (John 4:23,24) May we persevere in finding truth seekers and strengthen their relationship with the God of truth. He </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font8"> be found!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">interested persons. If you are at a highway rest stop that has a scenic background. perhaps you could begin to witness by asking someone: “Would it not be nice if the whole earth looked like this?” If you are at a beautiful beach or park, a similar introduction could be used.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> At the District Convention: </span><span class="font8">We can also find occasions to witness informally at the district convention. Many have found success in talking to motel and hotel employees or in speaking to people while on the street or at a bus stop. Be sure to wear a badge card during the convention. You may patronize the local restaurants and stores, and perhaps people will ask you what your badge card represents. This may lead to your giving a fine witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The summer months may offer us refreshment and relaxation, but let us not overlook the opportunities we have to give an informal witness. This method of preaching is fruitful, and Jehovah’s servants should share in it. As with Jesus, may our love for fellow humans move us to speak out on every appropriate occasion!—Matt. 5:14-16.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meetings for June</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">NOTE: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review may be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on key points. This well-prepared review will help the brothers remember key points for personal application and use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

There is a need to make final check to see that all have transportation arrangements. There are some cautions all should have in mind. No one should plan late-night recreation during convention, since all of us need sufficient rest. We should plan on witnessing. To whom? People met on public transportation and at gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and so forth. We must be discerning when offering literature and should not leave literature indiscriminately in public places or with persons who do not show genuine interest.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Love for Jehovah and for our fellowman is what moves us to participate more fully in the preaching activity. As our love for Jehovah and for people grows, we are stimulated to plan for an even greater share in the ministry. Our love expands as we increase in “accurate knowledge” of God's Word. (Phil. 1:9, 10) The more we learn about Jehovah’s will, the more we appreciate the urgency of the times in which we are living. This Intensifies our concern for others. Many are expressing their loving concern by taking up the pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Can you make necessary adjustments to become an auxiliary or a regular pioneer? Granted, not all of us are able to pioneer. But each one of us should analyze his circumstances prayerfully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Few Christians find that they have much free time to pioneer; therefore, it becomes necessary to ‘buy out the opportune time’ from those unnecessary things that are presently demanding our time. (Eph. 5:15-17) Our love for God and for people should make us willing to sacrifice some of our personal desires and comforts in order to express our love more fully. (Mark 12:33) Many of the things we acquire, and perhaps feel are normal, may be viewed as luxuries in other parts of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> What can parents do to assist their children to think in this God-oriented way? Parents should put theocratic goals before their children from an early age. As they approach graduation from school, are they thinking of secular goals or of spiritual ones? We want to help our youth see the lasting benefits that come from entering the pioneer service at an early age. This is storing up treasures in heaven. (Matt. 6:19-21) It pleases God and gives evidence of our loyalty and devotion to him. And it saves the lives of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> It is God’s will that ‘all sorts of people should be saved.’ (1 Tim. 2:4) Can we show that this is also our will? We can if we are willing to put Kingdom interests first. We can also do this by having confidence that Jehovah will provide the necessities of life. (Matt. 6:31-33) Economic conditions may worsen, but Jehovah’s promise to care for us never changes—Ps. 37:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Exerting ourselves to share in the field ministry as much as our circumstances allow is an expression of love. For some this will mean being a regular pioneer. Why not do all you can to start by September 1, 1992?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Introducing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Many today feel that their choice of religion is a very private matter. Thus, it can be challenging to talk to our neighbors about this subject. But now we have the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God,</span><span class="font8"> which has proved to be an invaluable aid in preaching to people of varied religious backgrounds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> What will you say to arouse the householder’s interest in reading this book? What points or features will you highlight that will appeal to professed Christians? to those with nonChristian beliefs? or to those without faith? The following suggestions will help us be prepared to show our neighbors the need to “search for Jehovah” and to “call to him while he proves to be near.” (Isa. 55:6) The suggestions can be adapted to local circumstances.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Why Investigate What We Have to Say?: </span><span class="font8">Since many profess to be satisfied with their religion and are not' interested in changing, we may need to tailor our introduction to help the householder examine with an open mind what we have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'After an appropriate greeting, you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “In talking to our neighbors, we find that many people are satisfied with their religion and do not wish to change. But if people took the time to examine the beliefs of others, do you think this could lead to better understanding and less hatred in the world? [Allow householder to respond.] Notice what the Bible says about those who love God and how they should feel about others.” After reading Acts 17:26, 27, direct attention to paragraphs 15 and 16 on page 10 of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Many have found that turning to a chapter in the book that discusses the householder’s religion will capture his attention. Note how this could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'After introducing yourself, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “With so many religions today, have you ever wondered how we can determine if our religion is approved by God?” After the householder comments, direct his attention to the box on page 377 of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God,</span><span class="font8"> which shows ten ways to identify the true religion, noting particularly point number 7. Ask the householder if he agrees that one practicing true religion should feel that way about other races and nationalities. If time allows, look up the three scriptures cited. Then conclude by stating that the other nine reasons given have similar sound Scriptural backing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Other Helpful Features: </span><span class="font8">The extensive subject index in the back of the book can also be used. For example. what if many people in the territory feel that all religions are just different roads leading to God? Then look under the heading “Religion&quot; where there Is a subheading entitled “‘all religions equal’: 12.” This illustrates how the index can help us find talking points. When speaking with those who do not believe in God, we might show them paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 329, which address the question of modern disbelief. The five &quot;Questions That Require an Answer” on pages 17-18 may especially interest those who question whether the Bible teaches what most religions preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’By using effective transitions to introduce the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God,</span><span class="font8"> we may be able to help the people with whom we talk to search for the one true God, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Returning With the Goal of Starting a Bible Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> After initially locating an interested person, thoroughness is needed on our part to keep this interest alive. Making return visits may lead directly into lifesaving Bible discussions and Bible studies. Consider these suggestions for making effective return visits. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">At the end of the initial call, you might lay the groundwork for a return visit by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Have you ever wondered why there are so many religions?&quot; Upon returning you could say: “The last time I was here, the question was raised as to why there are so many religions. There are a number of reasons for this. I would like to read something Interesting that I found in my review of this question.&quot; Turn to page 322 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book and read the section under the subheading “Why are there so many religions?&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Can God be found in all religions? </span><span class="font8">For God to be with a religion, It must be producing the right fruitage. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To start a return visit, you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “How should religion affect a person’s conduct? What Jesus Christ stated at Matthew 7:17-20 gives us the guidelines that true religion is expected to follow.” Read the scripture directly from the end of paragraph 19 on page 12 of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.</span><span class="font8"> Then ask the householder what he sees in the picture on page 13. “While millions claim to believe in God, many deny him by their works.” Next, read the first two sentences of paragraph 20. “These violent actions identify religions that do not follow the direction given by Christ to love one another, even our enemies. On my next visit, perhaps we can discuss what a religion must be doing if it is bearing good fruitage.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What does the future hold for those who seek the true God? </span><span class="font8">A discussion of this question right from the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font8"> may lead to a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To begin a conversation, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “With economic conditions as they are now, many people wonder If they can have a positive view of the future. I have found the Bible to be very encouraging when it talks about the future. Let me share with you God’s promise in Isaiah 65:21,22,25. [Read and comment briefly on the scripture.] The book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font8"> answers some interesting questions on this, beginning in paragraph 17 on page 372.” Then demonstrate the Bible study arrangement, using paragraphs 17-20. “Next week I would like to consider the question, What is the foundation for the new world promised in the Bible?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• Make wise use of the time left to share in the thorough witness now being given in all nations of the earth. (Compare Acts 20:21.) Making return visits with the goal of starting a Bible study could mean everlasting life for those to whom we preach.</span></p>

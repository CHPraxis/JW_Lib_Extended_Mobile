</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is truly unique because it is a bearer of good news. In contrast, most worldly publications feature news that is bad and disheartening. How can we show others that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is different, containing a message that is truly refreshing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We could call attention to “The Purpose of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower’</span><span class="font9"> on page 2 of the magazine. Point out that its aim is to exalt Jehovah as the Sovereign Ruler, note world events that fulfill Bible prophecy, give a comforting message to those who are oppressed, and strengthen faith in God’s provisions for our salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Do our comments about </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> convey such thoughts in a convincing way? What we say should not be just a catchy phrase to spark</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Appreciation for Christ’s Death</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matt. 20:28) No other man who has ever lived on earth could do what Jesus Christ did for mankind. By m</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eans of his life</span><span class="font9"> course and eventual death on a torture stake, we have been directed in the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">way to receive th</span><span class="font9">e greatest gift that anyone could obtain, everlasting l</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ife.</span><span class="font9"> Yet, mos</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">t people</span><span class="font9"> have little </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">appreciation</span><span class="font9"> for what Christ did.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Consider an encounter that Jesus had with </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ten</span><span class="font9"> lepers. When they caught sight of Jesus, they cried out\“Jesus, Instructor, have mercy bn us!” (Luke 17:13) He did have mercy on them, instructing them, according to the Law, to go and report to the priests. On the way, </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">all ten lepers were healed</span><span class="font9">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> But </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">only one returned</span><span class="font9"> to Jesus to express thanks. The other nine? They continued on their way with no thought of thanking their benefactor. (Luke 17:15-17) Whom do we resemble? We want to be like the man who went back. He had true appreciation. Is that how we.feel about Christ’s death?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">momentary interest; it should have substance, inspiring confidence that creates a desire to learn more.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Preparation Needed: </span><span class="font9">We need to read each magazine carefully, analyzing various presentations with our territory in mind. Looking up cited Scripture texts enhances our own understanding. This can deepen our appreciation for the truth and motivate us to share it with others. If the truth is not in our hearts, we will have little incentive to speak out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The interest manifested by an individual determines what we will offer. When the response is negative or complacent, our spoken remarks may suffice. If there is interest but it is limited, it may be best simply to offer the latest magazines or a brochure. If there are</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Showing Our Appreciation: </span><span class="font9">Each year the Soci</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ety suggests</span><span class="font9"> that specific verses in &quot;the Bible be read during the week prior to the Memorial date. The suggested Bible readings can be found under the dates of </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">April 12-17</span><span class="font9"> on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1992 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </span><span class="font9">We can sho</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">w our appreciation</span><span class="font9"> by r</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ead-</span><span class="font9">irig and meditating on these events that took place in Jesus’ life just before his death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Our fi</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eld service activity</span><span class="font9"> is </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">related </span><span class="font9">to appreciation for the Memorial. Elders will want to ma</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ke well-organize</span><span class="font9">d arrang</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ement</span><span class="font9">s so that pioneers and publishers will be able to plan increased fi</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eld activity during Apri</span><span class="font9">l</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> This is usually a month when tens of thousands share in the auxiliary pioneer work. Last </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">April 69,887 parti</span><span class="font9">c</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ipated</span><span class="font9"> here in the United States. Can you do so this April? If you are not able to auxiliary pioneer, plan to increase your share in the preaching activity as circumstances allow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Build Appreciation in Others: </span><span class="font9">Each year at the Memorial celebration, many interested persons meet with us. For example, of the 10.650J58. expressions of genuine appreciation and a desire to learn more, It would be appropriate to offer a subscription. Usually, it is best to start a new subscriber with a six-month subscription; it can be renewed if there is sustained interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> When you read the articles In the latest issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> try to recall previous discussions with householders where these subjects stirred Interest. Make it a point to return with that issue for further discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> We do not know how long and to what extent the good news will yet be proclaimed. We can be sure, however, that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> will play a major role in what is accomplished. Using this provision, we should imitate the apostles in diligently “teaching and declaring... the good news of the word of Jehovah.”—Acts 15:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">persons who attended the Memorial worldwide last March, more than 6,370,</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">000 were interested person</span><span class="font9">s. This shows the great potential for growth in the organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> We should u</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">se the Society’s printe</span><span class="font9">d In</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">vitation</span><span class="font9">s and mak</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">e arrangeme</span><span class="font9">nts to provide transpo</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">rtati</span><span class="font9">on for Bible students and interested persons where needed. Be wa</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">rmly enthusiastic</span><span class="font9"> when inviting them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Hel</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">p them to see why the Memori</span><span class="font9">-al.was instituted, wh</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">o partake</span><span class="font9"> of the emblems, and what the emblems represent (1 Cor. 11:23-26) Also, e</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">xplai</span><span class="font9">n the hope of those par</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">taking</span><span class="font9"> and that of observers w</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ho do not</span><span class="font9"> partake of the emblems. (John 10:16: Rev. 14:3,4) This will help interested persons to understand that all need to ‘exercise faith’ and that just attending the Memorial of Christ’s death once a year is not enough.—John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> The Memorial of Christ’s death is a very^ </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">special event</span><span class="font9"> By thoroughly preparing for it, we show that we truly appreciate all that Jehovah and Christ have done for us. Building appreciation for this occasion in our Bible students and other interested persons will help them, also, to exercise faith in Jehovah’s ransom provision through Jesus Christ</span></p>

Publisher presents him with magazines and expresses desire to return and discuss matter further. Householder agrees. After demonstration, chairman asks publisher why he did not offer to write up a subscription.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We often refer to the months of March and April as the Memorial season. Since the Memorial celebration always takes place at this time of year, Jehovah’s people are stirred to increase their participation in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Some who were enrolled as auxiliary pioneers in March will continue and be joined by others in this expanded ministry during April. If you can have a share, your application should be turned in immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Even those not able to pioneer can make April a special month by increasing their field ministry. Certainly, there is much to be done. Perhaps congregation publishers and pioneers can invite new unbaptized publishers to work with them in the field. Extra effort should be made to invite all interested persons to the Memorial on April 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’By being alert to welcome new ones who attend, you may be able to start another Bible study. With Jehovah’s blessing upon your increased efforts, your ministry will be fruitful and April will prove to be a special month for you—Ps. 34:8; Prov. 10:22.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> At Isaiah 60:22, Jehovah made a promise that is being fulfilled before our very eyes^'The little one himself will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.; When we think of a nation, we picture a vast group of people who are drawn together by common interests and who are functioning under the authority of a constituted government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The 1991 field service report showed a peak of 4,278,820 publishers of the good news worldwide, a 6.5-percent incre</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ase</span><span class="font10"> over the previous year. Jehovah has truly gathered a vast throng of sincere people who desire to separate.themselves from this oppressive sy</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">stem</span><span class="font10"> ancp become l</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">oyal subjects of</span><span class="font10"> the Messianic Kingdom government by his Son, Jesus Christ. Year by year the number of gathered ones continues to increase. We rejoice to be pa</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">rt of this natio</span><span class="font10">n that can literally be described as a new world society. At the observance of the Memorial in 1991, the total attendance was 1</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">0,650158,</span><span class="font10"> a 7-percent increase over 1990. This represents a tremendo</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">us poten</span><span class="font10">tial for many more to join us as Kingdom subjects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We realize, of course, that </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">not al</span><span class="font10">l the individuals included in the above Memorial attendance figure have separated themselves from this world to the extent necessary to be fully acceptable as Jehovah’s people. People from all nations are ‘streaming to Jehovah’s house,’ but they need to be fully ‘instructed about his ways’ so that they can “walk in his paths.” (Isa. 2:2-4) More than four million who attended the Memorial have accepted God’s instruction, acquiring spiritual strength that has motivated them to maintain </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">clean conduct</span><span class="font10"> and qualify for a share in the Kingdom-preaching work now being accomplished. (Matt. 24:14) Such ones have a good standing in Jehovah’s eyes and enjoy the benefits of all the marvelous provisions he makes available to them. What must the remaining number of more than six million do tfthey are likewise to beco</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">me spir</span><span class="font10">it</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ually stron</span><span class="font10">g and clean for Jehovah’s service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> They have to put up “a hard fight for the faith.” (Jude 3) Once they choose to walk in Jehovah’s way, they come under pressure from the Devil through trials, temptations, and bad-influences. Like Paul, they must look to Jehovah for strength to endure. (Phil. 4:13) Jehovah imparts strength to such ones through those who have already become strong in the faith. Paul admonished that (“we ... who are strong ought yj bear the weaknesses of those not strong.’’ (Rom. 15:1,2) When the strong and the weak become u</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nited</span><span class="font10">, there </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">is streng</span><span class="font10">th to stand firm/“Two are better than one.... If somebody could overpower one alone, two together could make a stand against him.”—Eccl. 4:9,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> This means that new ones rightful</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ly de</span><span class="font10">pend on us as the means through which they can receive strength from Jehovah. Those of us who are dedicated Christians mu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">st keep spi</span><span class="font10">ritually </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">stron</span><span class="font10">g ourselves if we are to h</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">elp new </span><span class="font10">ones. Christians who are strong are able to ‘impart spiritual gifts,’ which results in ‘an interchange of encouragement.’ (Rom. 1: 11,12) This is one of the prim</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ary ways J</span><span class="font10">ehovah uses to unite us and make all of us ‘firm and strong.’—1 Pet. 5:9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> We should make it our aim to help these new o</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nes w</span><span class="font10">hile at the same time keeping conscious of our own spiritual needs. (Matt. 5:3) Spiritu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ality is the key to our</span><span class="font10"> strength. This is a quality that must be nourished a</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ndfortified </span><span class="font10">by a r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">egular intake</span><span class="font10"> of spiritual food. Through his organization, Jehovah provides balanced programs for study of his Word. The fiv</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e week</span><span class="font10">ly congregation meetings play a vital role in making us strong, ‘inciting us to love and fine works.’—Heb. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The benefits of these meetings are multiplied when they are combined with good habits of personal and family study. As a minimum goal, all of us should read and consider the daily text keep up with the Bible reading program set out in the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule, and prepare for the Congregation Book Study and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study. Each family will have to deter</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">mine how</span><span class="font10"> that is gbing~to be organized, making sure that it is done on a regular basis. Also, the family head should see that the study program is tailored to meet the specific spiritual needs of the family. In this way the “household will be built up.... It will prove firmly established.” (Prov. 24:3) If we are co</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nscientious in our study</span><span class="font10"> habits as individuals and as families, we can be confident that Jehovah will bless us and his spirit will help us to endure various trials successfully—Jas. 1:2,3; 1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Keeping Clean and Above Reproach: </span><span class="font10">While Jehovah warmly invites us to draw close to him, at the same time, he makes it clear that this is done on th</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e basi</span><span class="font10">s of our exercisin</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">g fait</span><span class="font10">h in Jesus’ shed blood,' which “cleanses us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7; see also Hebrews 9:14.) We can continue to strengthen our faith by personal study pf God’s Word and by applying what we learn. Some later lose out because either they f</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">all to take in spiritual fo</span><span class="font10">odor they make little e</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffort to appl</span><span class="font10">y it in their lives. This leaves them vulnerable to the attacks of Satan. Some have become spiritually weak, resulting in inactivity. Sadly, others have allowed themselves to succ</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">umb to serious wrongdoin</span><span class="font10">g, causing^ them to be disfellowshipped. Paul warned: “Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.”)(l Cor. 10:12) If we willfully neglect study, meeting attendance, and service, we can be easily ensnared by unholy influences and temptations.—Heb. 2:1; 2 Pet. 2:20-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> It is essential that we keep ourselves clean in every way: physically, mentally, spiri</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tually</span><span class="font10">, and morally. (2 Cor. 7:1) The world that surrounds us is becoming more perverse and degraded every day. The Devil keeps coining up with ever more deceptive ways to entrap us. Keeping ourselves, spiritually strong ensures that we will notice‘ignorant of his designs and be overreached.’(2 Cor. 2:11) The instruction and counsel we receive from Jehovah’s organization enable us to recognize and resist bad influences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Those taking the lead in the congregation have the responsibility to set a fine example for others in keeping strong and staying clean. Paul erpphasized this responsibility when he stated: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you.... As you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.”) (Heb. 13:7) It is vital that appointed elders and ministerial servants be exemplary in their personal conduct as well as in caring for their responsibilities </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">as family heads</span><span class="font10">. They should strive to be like young Timothy, who was urged to “become an ex</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ampl</span><span class="font10">e... in speaking, in condu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ct, in</span><span class="font10"> l</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ove, i</span><span class="font10">n faith, in chasteness.”) (1 Tim. 4:12; 1 Pet. 5:3) AU the rest of us share this responsibihty to be good examples by maintaining honorable conduct. New ones often judge the truth, as weU as Jehovah’s organization, by what the</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">y see in us.</span><span class="font10"> We want to make sure that what they see encourages them to take their place in Jehovah’s clean organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> The ingathering for survival through “the great tribulation” continues to pick up momentum. (Rev. 7:14) Only those who become spirituaUy strong and keep themselves clean wiU ultimately, survive. Much depends on these factory: (1)/maintaining good personal study habits and meditating on God’s Word; (2) displaying a genuine personal interest in one another with a desire to impart encouragement; and (3) working together unitedly to maintain clean conduct that will honor Jehovah’s name. Doing these things will assure us of Jehovah’s blessing and protection when this world comes to its end. We can be confident that we will be among “the faithful ones Jehovah is safeguarding.”—Ps. 31:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">■ Should the congregation keep a file of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the May 1972 issue of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> it was pointed out that it is advisable to keep in the Kingdom Hall library a file for the monthly editions of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> for reference purposes. It continues to be appropriate to maintain such a file in each Kingdom Hall library for the use of the elders and the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With such a file available, publishers can refer to past material bearing on field service presentations, conducting Bible studies, making return visits, and so forth. Good ideas for use in the ministry can be found. From time to time, current issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry refer</span><span class="font9"> to issues that were published before some of the brothers were associated with the congregation. Newly associated ones can benefit if the file is kept. One of the newly designed </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> file cases could be used to store past copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The elders should assign either the Theocratic Ministry School overseer or a qualified ministerial servant to make sure that this file is kept up-to-date month by month. While the information presented in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> is in the form of suggestions and not rigid rules, it is still a fine source of reference material that should be a part of each congregation Kingdom Hall library. Back issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font9">cannot be ordered from Brooklyn, however.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Effective Initial Calls</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Starting conversations in the ministry can be quite challenging since people are so preoccupied with their own affairs or have definite opinions about religion. What can we have in mind that will assist us in making our initial call effective?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since this is a holiday season, you might begin your conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “At this time of the year, the sacrifice of Jesus is certainly on our minds. What do you think Jesus is doing now?” Allow for a response. Then you might share with the householder Revelation 6:2, which describes Jesus as seated upon a white horse and going forth to complete his conquest. Comment on his kingly role and the lasting benefits his rulership will bring to all obedient mankind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When offering the April 1 issue with the article “True Freedom—From What Source?,” you might say:</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book on Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “I planted, Apollos watered.” So stated the apostle Paul. (1 Cor. 3:6) These four words provide a simple outline for the first two steps in making disciples. The return visit work has often been referred to as the “watering” work. It Is an indispensable link between the initial contact and the person becoming a baptized disciple. The return visit work enables us to ‘scatter knowledge about’ to nurture the grain of interest shown until it takes root and a Bible study is started.—Prov. 15:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Some may be reluctant to call again where interest was shown because of uncertainty about what to say. Our handbook </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> has proved to be most useful in doing this watering. Usually before the householder will agree to a regularly scheduled Bible study, a series of short visits must be made. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font9">book provides outlines of Scriptural themes that can be discussed with the householder. Prepare well for the return visit, perhaps using one or more of the following suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you placed a copy of the April 15, 1992, “Watchtower” on the subject of prayer, when you </span><span class="font9">■ “People around the world are struggling for freedom. But promises of freedom by human governments have failed to mature. Worship of Jehovah, the true God, brings lasting freedom.” Read 2 Corinthians 3:17, and point out that this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> highlights God’s promise and shows why world events confirm that our liberation is near at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might introduce the April 15, 1992, “Watchtower” by highlighting the subject of prayer, saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “People generally pray for victory in times of war. Do you think God hears such prayers and takes sides? (Allow for response.] Consider the Bible’s answer.” Then read and comment on 1 Peter 3:12. After a brief explanation, point to something in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> article that may stimulate the person’s Interest in reading the magazine. If you detect genuine interest, you might offer the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">return you might pose the question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “What could make a person’s prayers unacceptable to God?” After allowing the householder time to respond, take out your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book and turn to page 293. Discuss with him some of the scriptures under that theme, encouraging him to read directly from the book. If you discern sincere interest, you may then choose to offer the subscription.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> On another return visit, after asking the householder what he understands God’s Kingdom to be, as referred to in the Lord’s Prayer, turn to pages 226-32. As time permits, develop the scriptures under “Is God’s Kingdom a Real Government?&quot; and “What Will God’s Kingdom Accomplish?” Clear up the common misconception that the Kingdom is in one's heart. The Kingdom is a real government! Rather than cover all the material at one time, raise some questions to discuss later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In another instance, the householder may take a copy of the April 22, 1992, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> on “Life—What Is Its Purpose?&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Keep in mind that our goal is to conduct Bible studies. Since many will be auxiliary pioneering in April, we will have even more opportunities to find individuals who are interested in studying the Bible. But even if our circumstances do not allow us to auxiliary pioneer during April, we can all set the goal of starting a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Some publishers have used tracts to start Bible studies on the initial call.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When offering the tract “Life in a Peaceful New World,” you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We are volunteers In your neighborhood. Let me give you this tract, which identifies the nature of our work. Do you think the world will ever look like that?” After getting a response, you could discuss the first few paragraphs with the person, highlighting Matthew 6:9, 10 and Psalm 37:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Give careful thought as to how you will introduce yourself. Excellent suggestions are presented in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font9">book on pages 9-15. Skillfully utilizing these introductions will help make your initial calls effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Is there any evidence that the human body was designed to live forever on the earth?” Or, “Do you think the dead know what the living are doing?&quot; These questions may spark some interest in the householder because they affect him personally. Make arrangements to return with the answers, as found in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book on pages 247 and 100, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If the initial discussion was regarding the future of the earth, you could ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Will humans be permitted by God to ruin the earth in some way?” Then turn to pages 44-5 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font9">book and discuss the Scriptural answer. Or the householder may ask: “If billions are resurrected from the dead, where will they all live?” The answer can be found in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, page 340.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Try not to flood the householder with all the truth at one time. Leave some questions to be answered on future visits. As God's fellow workers, we want to carry out skillfully the planting and watering by effective use of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book. We can be assured that God will make it grow.</span></p>

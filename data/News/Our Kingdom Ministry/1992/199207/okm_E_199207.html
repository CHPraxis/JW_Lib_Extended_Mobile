</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As we witness the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, we rejoice in our Kingdom hope.,and we are moved to speak about it to aijy who will listen. (Luke 6:45; Rom. 12:12) Our featuring brochures in the field ministry during July is one way in which we can share our Kingdom hope with others as Jesus commanded.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Since we have a number of colorful and Informative brochures to choose from, which of them might best meet the needs of those in our territory and stir their interest? To make the best possible use of the brochures, we must know their contents. The following brief review will help us in this regard.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> The Government That Will Bring Paradise:</span><span class="font9"> When Jesus was on earth, the Kingdom of God was the theme of his preaching. This brochure shows that the Kingdom is a real government and how it will solve problems that make life so difficult today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!:</span><span class="font9"> It explains why God made man and how we can enjoy life on earth forever. Descriptive il</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">lustration</span><span class="font9">s and the concise text in this brochure appeal to yo</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ung o</span><span class="font9">nes and to those with Jim-ite</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">d reading abil</span><span class="font9">ity. It may also be used to convey basic </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible teach</span><span class="font9">ings to those with impaired hearing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">3 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever:</span><span class="font9"> This brochure discusses God’s name from a Scriptural and historical perspective, showing why it is vital for Christians both to know the name and to use it in their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘“Look! I Am Making All Things New&quot;:</span><span class="font9"> This brochure portrays paradise and builds appreciation for the Bible and our Creator. After discussing why God permits badness, it focuses on three basic Bible teachings: the ransom, the resurrection, and the Kingdom. This brochure also has questions at the bottom of the pages, which makes it easier for us to conduct a Bible study in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3 7</sup> Should You Believe in the Trinity?: </span><span class="font9">People may say they believe in the Trinity, yet they differ in their understanding of it. This brochure answers such questions as: What is the Trinity? Does the Bible teach it? Is Jesus Christ the almighty God and part of a Trinity? What is the holy spirit, and how does it function?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’Once we have selected the brochures that we would like to use in the house-to-house ministry or when witnessing informally, we should review the articles on the back page of this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font9">There we will find suggestions for offering our literature and making return visits with a view to developing interest and starting a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> On many occasions, whether witnessing formally or informally, a particular brochure is just what is needed to give a fine witness. However, we must be prepared, have an adequate supply of brochures, know what Is in them, and be discerning. May Jehovah’s blessing on our zealous ministry result in many more rejoicing with us in the Kingdom hope!—Acts 13:47, 48.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Accepting, Applying, and Benefiting From God’s Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Although mill</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ions</span><span class="font9"> of people have a copy of the Bible, many do not'acce</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">pt it as the WorcL</span><span class="font9">of-God. most do not apply its wise counsel, and thus few benefit from it. However, Jehovah's people </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">truly believe</span><span class="font9"> that itTs the Word of God and that it is beneficial fo</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">r all things.</span><span class="font9"> (2 Tim. 3:1157T?) Hence. fhe tneme for the circuit assembly program for the 1993 service year will be “Accepting, Applying, and Benefiting From God’s Word.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’There will be talks, demonstrations, skits, experie</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">nces,</span><span class="font9"> and interviews to encourage us, to deepen our appreciation for God’s Word, and to help us apply it more fully in all aspects of life. The Saturday afternoon program_will consider counsel and discipline within the family circle in connection with entertainmeht/~as-</span><span class="font10">sociation, and materialism. It will </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">show how</span><span class="font9"> we must be different from the world and not adopt its bad manners and irreverent or obscene language. In addition, encouragement will be provided to benefit single parents and fatherless children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Also, on Saturday newly dedicated persons will have the opportunity to be baptized after hearing a Scriptural talk on the subject. Those planning to be baptized at the circuit assembly should make_ their wish known as soon as possible to the presiding overseer of the congregation so that he will have sufficient time to arrange for elders to go over the questions for baptismal candidates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’The </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Sunday morning program </span><span class="font9">will examine ways in which we distinguish ourselves from the world by conforming to God's Word. The importance of our appearance and how to a</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">void corruptifig bur mind</span><span class="font9"> are among the subjects that will be examined.

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Offering Bible Studies?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many are having fine success in starting Bible studies by using the direct approach in offering people the opportunity to study the Bible. A man who had refused literature on several occasions responded readily when a Bible study was offered. He replied: “I have always wanted to study the Bible.” A Bible study was started, and the entire family made rapid progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> All should be conscious of starting studies. If individuals are going to make progress in becoming disciples of Christ, they must be taught. (Matt. 28:19, 20) To be taught, they need to have a Bible study conducted with them. Studies can often be started just by making the offer to demonstrate how the householder can learn more about the Bible and God’s promises. A brother was able to start five studies in the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font9"> Since he was not able to conduct that, many Bible studies regularly, he started turning the Bible studies over to other publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If we find it easy to start studies, we can take other publishers along with us and help them to get studies too. Or we can turn over some studies we start to others in the congregation. If you would like to conduct a Bible study, why not try making the offer of a Bible study to those you meet in the house-to-house ministry? In one case a publisher made a return visit on a teenage girl who did not show much Interest. Nevertheless, the publisher offered her a Bible study, and she accepted. She is now baptized, and her sister and her sister's husband are also attending meetings.—Gal. 6:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Not everyone we start a study with will continue to study. Not all of those who study will come into the truth. But some will. The more studies we start, the more likelihood there is that we will be able to help others become praisers of Jehovah. ■ Literature offer for July: Any of the following brochures: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, ‘Look!

An IBM PC-compatible computer, running DOS. with at least 512 kilobytes of random access memory and 71/2 megabytes of free space on a hard disk is needed to run this program.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ How may the service overseer oversee the work of ministerial servants handling the literature and magazine departments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The service overseer’s sphere of interest is not limited to visiting book study groups on a monthly basis and arranging regular meetings for field service. This zealous elder is keenly interested in everything that could affect the progress of the preaching work in the congregation’s assigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He will ensure that each month ample supplies of campaign literature and magazines are readily available and that they are in very good condition. To this end he oversees many of the responsibilities of ministerial servants assigned to handle the literature and magazine departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The service overseer pays particular attention to announcements of upcoming literature campaigns when these appear in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> He and the brother caring for the literature work closely together to ensure that a sufficient quantity of literature will be available for use. but they must be careful not to request too much. If a publication is to be used in the field for the first time or if it will soon be studied in the congregation, these factors should be considered when a request is placed with the Society. If the literature has been offered before, the congregation field service report for the last campaign will indicate whether supplies on hand will be adequate. Of course, consideration should also be given to such factors as the number of publishers who will serve as auxiliary pioneers for the month as well as the growth In the number of publishers and regular pioneers since the last time the literature was offered. Literature should be available both before and after congregation meetings. Cartons of literature should be properly stored in a clean, dry place and stacked so as to prevent any damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The service overseer will also cooperate with the brother who cares for the magazine department. From time to time, the service overseer and the brother handling the magazines should compare the number of magazines that are requested each month with the number of magazines that are actually placed in the ministry. It may be that some publishers should reduce their requested quantity of magazines if these regularly accumulate in their homes. Magazines should not be wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the same principles In mind, the service overseer should personally check the amount of campaign literature that the congregation is requesting on the Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). He will then turn the form over to the congregation secretary, who will carefully check the rest of the form, paying particular attention to the number of special-request items listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, a certain amount of paperwork is required in properly caring for the literature and magazine departments. If the assigned brothers have questions in connection with their use of forms and record keeping, the secretary will be happy to assist in this aspect of their work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ “We’ve been talking with our neighbors about w</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">hat can be done</span><span class="font9"> to ensure that there is employment and bousing for everyone, bo you believe it is reasonable to expect that </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">human gover</span><span class="font9">nments willaccomplish this?

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Some time has passed—perhaps a day or two, perhaps a week—since you last spoke to someone who showed interest in the Kingdom message. Whether he accepted Bible literature or not, it is important to cultivate any interest as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Review the notes you carefully made after the initial call. Then, when you pack your witnessing bag. be sure to include a copy of the literature you placed so that you can refer to it during the return visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If you placed the “Look!” brochure, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I am glad to see you once again. The last time we spoke, I showed you the cover of this brochure, and we read a scripture from the Bible to prove that, through his Kingdom, God will provide housing and employment for everyone. But God has also promised to put an end to sickness, old age, and even death. Do you find that hard to believe? [Allow for householder's response.] Notice this point in paragraph 4 of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> At this point in your presentation, you could tie in material from the latest magazines or from a brochure. If you are sharing in magazine work, you may select an appropriate point in the article “Hope </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Conquers Despair</span><span class="font9">!” in the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">July 1</span><span class="font9"> issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> If you are offering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Look!&quot;</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;"> brochur</span><span class="font9">e, why not show how the concept of housing and employment for all is illustrated on the fr</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ont and back covers</span><span class="font9"> of the brochure. You can open it so that the householder will see the entire illustration at one time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">*In territories where householders have a varie</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ty of conce</span><span class="font9">rns, a more flexible introduction will be helpful. You may want to try the second introduction listed in the Bpn son iriphrety Tinker “</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9">.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jesus taught</span><span class="font9"> us to pray for God’s Ki</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ngdom</span><span class="font9"> to come and forRis will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> To prepare the way for a future visit, you could bring the conversation to a close by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Of course, everything we have considered is in the Bible, but many people wonder whether they can really believe what the Bible says. The next time I come. I would like to take a few minutes to consider this subject with you.” When you return to cultivate the interest, take up the discussion from the subheading “The Book That Explains Paradise,” beginning with paragraph 5 of the brochure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">* In Territories Where Little Literature Is Placed: The same general presentation may be used when visiting people who showed some interest but accepted no literature. You may refer to the brochure that you offered in the course of the previous conversation. It</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If you are featuring the July 15 “Watchtower,” you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Many people would like to believe that this promise will be fulfilled, but they are not sure whether the Bible is a reliable guide. I am sure you will find this article, ‘Does the Bible Contradict Itself?,’ to be faith strengthening.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ “I know as an older person you are much more experienced in life than I am, but this scripture is comforting to all of us.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Be sure to make a careful record of any placements, including the specific brochure or magazines placed. You will need this information when you return to cultivate the interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">may be necessary to make repeated calls using the Bible and your personal copy of the brochure before the householder accepts a brochure. If you placed either the July 1 or the July 15 issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> refer to related subjects in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look!&quot;</span><span class="font9"> brochure when returning to cultivate the interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> If you have placed two magazines, a bound book, or a brochure or have simply had an interesting Bible discussion with someone, you have the responsibility to cultivate the interest. We encourage all of you to set aside some time during July to share in this lifesaving work—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

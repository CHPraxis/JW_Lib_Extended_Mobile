<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Able to Auxiliary Pioneer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">'Jesus encouraged his followers to give of themselves freely in the ministry, and he assured them that following this course would bring them happiness and many spiritual blessings. (Matt. 10: 8b; Acts 20:35) Last April over 69,000 individuals experienced firsthand the joys of increased activity as auxiliary pioneers. Are you able to share in these blessings this year by enrolling as an auxiliary pioneer during either March or April or perhaps both months?—Ps. 34:8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Examining Your Circumstancesi </span><span class="font10">As you consider the experiences cited below, ask yourself: ‘Do I see myself In any of these examples? How could I make needed adjustments that would open the way for me to auxiliary pioneer?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> One sister was able to auxiliary pioneer even though she has five children and works secularly. How was she rewarded? Her husband and children gave her excellent support, and as a result of the sister’s good example, the husband was moved to become an unbaptized publisher the following month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In one congregation all the elders and ministerial servants served as auxiliary pioneers during one month. Most of them had secular jobs, but they were intensely occupied with spiritual activities on weekends. The fine lead they provided in preaching and in organizing the field service benefited the entire congregation. Of the 77 publishers, 73 shared in some form of pioneer service during the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> A 15-year-old schoolgirl used her two-week spring vacation to share tn the auxiliary pioneer service and says: “I can really see the difference, especially an improvement in conversation. I was able to hold many more conversations with people at the door.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Those who have retired from secular employment often have excellent opportunities to pursue Kingdom interests. After the death of her husband, an 84-year-old sister wrote: “All my children had grown up and were married and had families. They did not neglect me, but their visits could not overcome the feelings of loss and loneliness. Then one of the elders in our congregation suggested that I try auxiliary pioneering. I hesitated but finally decided to try it. What a joy! I felt that Jehovah had permitted me to live to this age so that I could experience auxiliary pioneering. I have continued as an auxiliary pioneer every month since.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup>A brother who sells real estate adjusted his schedule for showing homes so as to allow time for pioneer service. Others have similarly adjusted their employment to make room for such increased activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Make Your Plans Nowi </span><span class="font10">Why not make positive plans now to auxiliary pioneer in March and April? To be successful, careful planning is needed. This is evident from the experiences of those who were able to auxiliary pioneer even though they had family responsibilities, full-time secular jobs, and other Scriptural obligations. Talk with others who have successfully pioneered to get the benefit of their experience. Also, approach Jehovah in prayer, asking for his help.—Isa. 40:29-31; Jas. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> There is no question about it, many are the joys of those who arrange their affairs to serve as auxiliary pioneers. If you are not already in the full-time service, could you be enjoying this privilege? If you make the effort to expand your privilege of sharing the good news with others. Jehovah will certainly pour out upon you a rich blessing. —Mal. 3:10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Be Sure to Call Back </span><span class="font10">er calls, the brother d</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecided to ca</span><span class="font10">ll on this person. A Bible study was started.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> One brother placed tw</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o magazin</span><span class="font10">es with a man but forgo</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">t about hir</span><span class="font10">mthink-ing he was no</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">t really interested</span><span class="font10">- A few days later, the man wrote a letter to the local congregation to requ</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">est~5antism </span><span class="font10">A missionary sister was asked what she felt was the most outst</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">anding fact</span><span class="font10">or in her having been able t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o help 74.</span><span class="font10">persons to become publishers. She said£“ We did a lot <sup>of</sup> mag</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">azine work</span><span class="font10">, and<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark5">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark6">3</a></sup>1 kept </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">making return visits</span><span class="font10"> on people who accepted the magazines until I was able to start Bible studies with them.&quot; j</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> At times we may only be able to leave a tract with the householder on the initial visit. Often, tracts can be effectively u</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">sed on return visits</span><span class="font10"> to demonstrate a Biblg.study. A circuit overseer, working with another publisher, left a </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tract with a woman</span><span class="font10">. It was a very brief call, but he encouraged the sister to return. The sister made a r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">eturn visit </span><span class="font10">and immediately st</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">arted a Bi</span><span class="font10">ble study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> When Interest Is Shown: </span><span class="font10">When the householder does not ta</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ke literature</span><span class="font10"> on the first call, this does </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">not always mea</span><span class="font10">n that he is not.interested. Making a return visit on a young couple, a publisher found that they a</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">lready had some of ou</span><span class="font10">r lite</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">rature,</span><span class="font10"> and had studied pre</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">viously</span><span class="font10">. They readily agreed to r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">esume the</span><span class="font10">jr — study. A special pioneer sensed </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">latent </span><span class="font10">interest in a woman who always re</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">fuse</span><span class="font10">d to accept the ma</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">gazin</span><span class="font10">es Thepionper put the </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">magazines asid</span><span class="font10">e, and the woman was willing to discuss a few paragraphs in one of the b</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ooklet</span><span class="font10">s. After a few more calls, she was having a Bible study twic</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">e a wee</span><span class="font10">k.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">~~ Each one who dedicates himself to Jehovah s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">hould feel a responsibilit</span><span class="font10">y to share In the disciple-making work. As we regularly call back on all who show interest, we will reap fruitage that will bring rich blessings both to ourselves 'and to those who listen to us.’—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Yes, this is harvesttime. We are now in the conclusion of the system of things, and as Jesus said in one of his parables, “The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things.” (Matt. 13:39) At John 5:17, Jesus said:(“My F</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ather has kept workin</span><span class="font10">g until now, and I </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">keep working</span><span class="font10">.”) In this harvesttime, activity, Jehovah’s people are </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">busy </span><span class="font10">not only in p</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">reach</span><span class="font10">ing the good news of the Kingdom but also in pr</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">oviding places of worshi</span><span class="font10">p. Now more than ever, Kingdom Halls are needed. Thankfully, Jehovah has moved his loyal servants to volunteer their </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">skill</span><span class="font10">s in the construction of Kingdom Halls. Not only are they working hard but they also are radiating a spirit of joy.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Observed by Others: </span><span class="font10">The apostle Paul said: “We have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.” (1 Cor. 4:9) Christians today areon </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">displa</span><span class="font10">y, and this is especially true during the time of K</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ingdom Hall construction</span><span class="font10">. The work being done anjp the j</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">oyful spiri</span><span class="font10">t of the workers do not go unnoticed. As a result, new</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">spapers</span><span class="font10"> print such bold headlines as “Jehovah’s Witnesses: Their Work Was Cut Out,” “In the True Spirit of Helping,” and “On the Third Day, They Rested.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> The unity_of the volunteer workers has always amaze</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">d onlookers</span><span class="font10">. In M</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">assachuset</span><span class="font10">ts a news account referred to the project as having &lt;“the sound of an old family reunion,” since the noise of the work was punctuated by “shouts of joyous greetings.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>21</sup> A news staff writer commented: “Rome wasn't built in a day, as the old saying goes, but the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses has just about put that theory to rest with the erection of their new Kingdom Hall.” In Alabama a writer covered the local Kingdom Hall building project and stated: (‘This may seem like something you only hear about, but it happened right here. . . .

People were all over it, inside and out.... There was no shouting, cussing, or apparent ordering. From a distance it seemed as if an unseen hand was directing everyone. Perhaps so. I’m still amazed at the reality of it.&quot; He concluded his letter by saying: “When they come to your home, they don’t mean to bother you. They just want to share their love and joy with everyone. Maybe we ought at least to listen to them. I know I will.

If you so qualify, could you make some adjustments so that you </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">would be in a position to volunteer? (</span><span class="font10">Isa. 6:8) For example, some elders or ministerial servants may be able to help with Kingdom Hall construction for one weekend each month or two.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>26</sup> Regional Building Committees and local building committees schedule the volunteers so that they are at the building site w</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">hen their help is needed</span><span class="font10">. These volunteers return to their home congregations and families as quickly as possible and do not unnecessarily miss </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">sharing in the meetings and field</span><span class="font10"> serviceactivity.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> Volunteer Procedure: </span><span class="font10">Howdoes one volunteer? In August 1990 each body of elders was sent a supply of Kingdom Hall Construction Worker Questionnaire forms. These are available for qualified workers upon request. As more forms are needed, the elders obtain them from the circuit overseer. The elders have detailed instructions regarding the volunteers needed and the qualifications that must be met.</span></p></li>

Return the completed form to the elders. They will add their comments and forward it to the circuit overseer, who, in turn, will complete the form and send it to the Regional Building Committee. If your personal circumstances allow and you qualify to volunteer, great blessings will be yours as you see the joy of your brothers and sisters upon completion of their Kingdom Hall construction project, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li></ul>

Since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established in September 1983, funds have been made available to assist with the construction of 1,000 new Kingdom </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hal's i</span><span class="font10">n the United States branch territory. These accommodate </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">1,488</span><span class="font10"> congregations. Many congregations could not have obtained such fine meeting places were it not for the. love_of the brotherhood that has been manifest in your generous support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>32</sup> The Society Kingdom Hall Fund makes loans to assist with constructing new Kingdom Halls. As moneys are repaid along with interest, these funds are lent to other congregationshaving a need. There are advantages in contacting the Society with a loan request before seeking funding from a commercial firm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>33</sup> Expressions of Appreciation: </span><span class="font10">When their new Kingdom Hall was completed, a congregation in Pennsylvania said this in a letter to the Society: “We are writing you to thank you for your loving assistance in the building of our new Kingdom Hall. Our building is now completely finished and dedicated to Jehovah, and the congregation is extremely grateful to have such a beautiful building for Jehovah’s worship. Our congregation has always gladly supported the Society Kingdom Hall Fund and local building projects and will continue to do so, realizing the great need for yet other congregations to benefit from this generous and important provision.’’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>34</sup> A congregation in California expressed appreciation for the loving assistancethat had been made available in their behalf, saying: “We wish to express to you our deepest thanks for the assistance of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Without it the construction of [our] hall would have been much more difficult and delayed for some time. Jehovah’s wisdom is certainly evident in this arrangement.”)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">“A Wisconsin congregation wrote: “It has been a little over a year since we dedicated our Kingdom Hall to Jehovah, and we want to express our appreciation for being a recipient of the [Society] Kingdom Hall Fund. What seemed </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">an impossibili</span><span class="font10">ty two years ago has now become a reality—all because of the loving generosity of our brothers and sisters.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>36</sup> From Oregon appreciation was expressed for the fund in these words: “How good it has been to have experienced Jehovah’s hand at work in our case. We have seen the love and unity of brothers working together to bring a great witness to Jehovah’s name in our community. Thank you so much for encouraging all of us to share our valuable things toward such a noble cause as the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> The Work Ahead: </span><span class="font10">Yes, all of us have reason to be joyful as we meet the needs of the harvest. We should have a spirit of cooperation—working together and fully supporting this necessary activity. (Ps. 133:1) How happy we are to have men appointed by Jehovah’s organization to take the lead both in spiritual matters and in the construction of needed facilities! Paul appealed to the Philippians, saying: “Make my joy full in that you are of the same mind and have the same love.” (Phil. 2:2) Surely, we have every reason to rejoice, as we are entrusted with the good news of the established Kingdom to “be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations” before the end comes. (Matt. 24:14) Our taking a firm stand on the side of that Kingdom and loyally working for its interests makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice. “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me.” (Prov. 27:11) What a remarkable privilege is ours to be working along and sharing joyfully with Jesus Christ in Jehovah’s work!</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> During February, we are featuring any 192-page book published in 1983or earlier or the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book. Any of these fine publications can be used to present the good news in a variety of ways. No doubt you will find it practical to learn and use one or all of the following suggested presentations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Earth—Man’s Lasting Home: </span><span class="font10">If you want to start conversations with people who are concerned about the earth and its environment, try the theme “The Earth to Last Forever as Mankind's Home.&quot; This topic is flexible enough to capture the attention of family-oriented people, nature lovers, and environmentalists. The scripture to use is Ecclesia</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">stes 1:4.</span><span class="font10"> The theme and scripture are explained in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book, pages </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">98-9,</span><span class="font10"> paragraphs 2 and 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> After introducing yourself, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I am calling briefly to discuss a matter of deep concern to many of us. The earth is our home, and no doubt you too are concerned about the way it is being ruined. Scientists and environmentalists keep warning that if the pollution continues, the earth could become uninhabitable. Do you see anysolution to</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> To be effective in starting a conversation with someone who has shown interest on the initial call, try to build on what was established on that earlier occasion. The objective is to help the person appreciate the value of the thoughts and literature left with him previously.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Take time to prepare for making the return visit. Select interest-arousing comments that are in the publication you are featuring. Exercise discernment in determining how much material to cover and how long to stay. In most cases a brief discussion of one or two points is best unless unusual interest is manifested. Consider the following themes:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What future conditions can we expect to be brought about on earth if it is to be man's lasting home? </span><span class="font10">This discussion is based on Isaiah 11:6-9 and 65: 25, as explained and illustrated in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book on pages 172-5. the problem? [Pause for householder to comment if he desires.) Briefly, I would like to show you what the Bible s^ys about the future of the earth at Ecclesiastes 1:4.” Read the text, and show comments in paragraphs 2 and 3 on pages 98-9 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security </span><span class="font10">book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">’Wickedness to Be Removed: </span><span class="font10">To appeal to people who are concerned about crime, violence, and war, you may want to converse with them on the theme “Wickedness to Be Removed So That Those Who Love God Can Enjoy Life and Peace.&quot; Psalm 37:9-11 makes this point, and it is explained in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 118-20^ paragraphs 13-15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Folloiving a customary introduction, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Do you think a time will ever come when we will not have to contend with crime and violence? [Allow for householder's response.) The Bible points to the lasting solution here at Psalm 37j_ 9-11.” Read the text and turn to pages 118-20 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security </span><span class="font10">book to read selected portions of paragraphs 13-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> The Resurrection Hope: </span><span class="font10">Since at some time every oneJiaslosta loved.one</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The conversation can be introduced by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “When I last visited, we discussed how God has purposed that the earth last forever. But I left a question for you to think about: What conditions must then prevail? I am happy to return and briefly share the Bible’s answer with you.” ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">’ What we must do to enjoy life under God's Kingdom. </span><span class="font10">This theme can be developed by using John 17:3 and Jeremiah 31:34, as explained in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book on pages 119-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To begin, you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I enjoyed my conversation with you on God's promise to end wickedness. [Ask person to get his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book.] A question that should concern each of us is, What can we do to be on hand to benefit from this change? Note what Jesus said at John 17:3, as quoted in your book on page 120.&quot; in death, it could be comforting to initiate conversations on the topic “Kingdom Rule to Restore Life </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">td Dead Lov</span><span class="font10">ed Ones Under Paradise Conditions.&quot; You could use either John 5?</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">28, Sfl</span><span class="font10">fotiLuke 23:43 and show the comments on the topic and scripture that are found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 166-7, paragraphs 12 and 13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> You could begin your conversation with the third introduction on page 14 of the “Reasoning” book and then say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “From tune to time most of us thipk about loved ones we have lost in death. But do you feel that we might see them again? [Give householder opportunity to express himself.) Many people we talk to are surprised to learn what God's Word has </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">promise</span><span class="font10">d and that this prospect will be r</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ealize</span><span class="font10">d right here on earth. Note the Bible’s promise at... ” Use either John 5:28</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">, 29</span><span class="font10"> or Luke 23: 43, and tie in the comments in paragraphs 12 and 13 on pages 166-7 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book or the illustrations on pages 164-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Prepare and use one or all of these presentations this month. It should not be difficult to locate appropriate quotations and illustrations in any of the publications you use. If little interestjig shown, offer a tracts that deals with a related subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> What needs will be satisfied in the Paradise earth? </span><span class="font10">You can use either Psalm 65:9-13 and 72:16 or Isaiah 11:6-9 and 65:25. Appropriate comments are made in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font10"> book on pages 174-5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Your opening words might be:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “When I was here last [give day], we took note of God’s promise through his Son to resurrect dead loved ones into a Paradise earth. What are some of the blessings to be enjoyed then? Your book Scripturally points out what some of these will be.” Based on the references above, read one or two cited texts from the Bible and comments from the book, perhaps paragraphs 7-10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Many people have shown interest in the Kingdom message we preach. In many cases, we discerned enough interest on their part to leave our literature. In other cases, we noted appreciation for our initial Scriptural conversation. Therefore, make return visits on all who have shown interest, and try to teach them the truth.—Matt. 10:11; 28:19, 20; John 21:17; Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li></ul>

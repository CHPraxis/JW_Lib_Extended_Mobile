<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Today the “good news” is being preached throughout the earth. (Matt. 24:14) This is being accomplished primarily by means of the house-to-house ministry—Acts 20:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Our presentations must have real meaning to the people we meet. Men. women, and youths differ in their fields of interest. So it would be good to be prepared with a variety of Scriptural subjects that are likely to appeal to the people in our territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Good Use of the Publications: </span><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book covers a wide range of subjects that should appeal to many people everywhere. The illustrations, both visual and verbal, are effective aids. The book appeals to the heart, and it helps people see the need to make decisions, yes, to change their beliefs, conduct, attitude, and way of life. Being thoroughly familiar with the contents of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font10">book will enable us to converse effectively with people on a wide variety of topics. This will help us discern the extent of the householder’s interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ To be effective in the ministry, we need to show genuine personal interest. (Phil. 2:4) Endeavor to focus the conversation on a Kingdom theme that involves the person and his needs. Seek to understand the person’s thinking by drawing him out with pertinent questions. Listen attentively to his answers. His comments may help you discern what subject will interest him. We want to help people see the value of the Kingdom message and show them how to learn more about it. One couple explained that they accepted a Bible study because the brother who called on them projected a sincere personal interest in them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> In Frequently Worked Territory: </span><span class="font10">Developing effectiveness is especially important in territory that is worked frequently. A more effective ministry helps us to expand our territory. (u&gt;88 7/15 pp. 15-20) Rather than acting as though we have never called at that home before, we can acknowledge the householder's past attitude and use it to our advantage. We can allude to our previous visit and then build on what was said at that time. Presentations suggested in past issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> and in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book can be adapted to the needs of the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah is patiently keeping the door open for more people to benefit from Kingdom blessings. Jesus’ ministry was effective because of his love for people. (Mark 6:34) Are we doing our utmost to follow his example? (1 Pet. 2:21) Let us not hold back from sharing fully and effectively in the house-to-house ministry.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Challenge of Making Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As ministers of the good news, we are commanded to make disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) This involves making return visits. Do you have a positive view of this vital part of our Christian ministry? Becoming skillful in making return visits can be a stimulating challenge—Prov. 22:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Each dedicated Christian should feel a responsibility to share in the disciple-making work. This may require that we set aside a measure of personal convenience in order to share the Kingdom hope with others. Return visits afford us the opportunity to help sincere ones satisfy their spiritual needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Follow Up All Interest: </span><span class="font10">Return visits should be made on all who express interest in the Kingdom message, even though they may decline our publications. There are many people who show interest by their willingness to discuss Bible subjects with us. Jesus and the apostles showed how interest in the Kingdom message can be cultivated by engaging people in pointed Scriptural discussions.—Mark 10:21; Acts 2:37-41.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ Our purpose in calling back should be to start a Bible study. We may be able to demonstrate to the householder how a home Bible study is conducted. You can be sure that Jehovah will respond to your prayer for help in finding an honesthearted person to teach. Jehovah will bless your earnest efforts in his service. Why not seek Jehovah’s help and make it a goal to start a Bible study?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Make Good Use of Tracts: </span><span class="font10">Tracts can be used effectively in starting Bible studies. Many have been able to get a conversation started simply by discussing the picture on the cover. Read one paragraph at a time with the householder. When a question is asked, stop and invite the householder to express himself. Look up the scriptures and show how they apply. The conversation can then be directed to the publication in which the study can be conducted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Use </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book: </span><span class="font10">Effective return visits can be made with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book. Reviewing the listing of principal subjects or the index can help you select appropriate information to discuss when following up previous conversations. The section “Scriptures Often Misapplied&quot; can be useful in dealing with objections that may arise. Pioneers report much success starting Bible studies by using information such as is found in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book on page 204 under “How do Jehovah’s Witnesses arrive at their explanation of the Bible?” They show the interested person how we let the Bible provide its own explanation. This works well and has resulted in starting a number of Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Like Jesus and the apostles, we need to demonstrate a sincere interest in Jehovah’s sheep. (Luke 9:11) Love for people will help us to reach out to them with the Kingdom truths. (2 Cor. 2:17) When we place the greater emphasis on giving of ourselves In behalf of the spiritual welfare of others, we are able to meet the challenge of making return visits.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Positive Action Toward Further Progress</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> By now most of us have finished reading the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1992 Yearbook.</span><span class="font11"> Learning about the 1991 worldwide peak of more than four-and-a-quarter-million Kingdom publishers in 211 lands—a 6.5-percent Increase—thrilled our hearts! Certainly, Kingdom increase now taking place around the world gives striking evidence of the fulfillment of Isaiah 2:2-4 and Micah 4:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Although the report for the 1992 service year is not complete, the evidence is clear that Jehovah is crowning this service year with outstanding increases. The invitation to join our vast international brotherhood continues to go forth. Memorial and district convention attendance figures show that millions of people are turning a hearing ear to the Kingdom message. From all nations, they are responding to the inspired invitation that calls out: “Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be Determined to Progress: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s organization is on the move. With so many new ones streaming up to the mountain of Jehovah’s true worship, it is vital that each one take positive action toward further spiritual progress and then reach out to help still newer ones do the same. The need for such progress is implied in the statement that those responding to the invitation to come up to Jehovah’s mountain say to others, “Come.” The apostle John reported something similar at Revelation 22:17: “And the spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Jesus demonstrated how this invitation is to be given. When people responded to his teaching, he invited them to share in his ministry and taught them how to do so. (Matt. 4:19; 10:5-7, 11-14) His disciples learned the effective methods he used by accompanying him and observing how he did things. They then patterned their ministry after his. They learned his methods so well that their bold witnessing drew the attention of opposers who clearly recognized that they were disciples of Jesus. Acts 4:13 reports: “Now when they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, . . . they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Before returning to heaven, Jesus gave the command that his disciples should perpetuate the Christian ministry by making new disciples, teaching them just as they themselves had been taught. At Matthew 28:19, 20, Jesus commanded: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations,... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.&quot; And indicating that he meant for this to continue down to our day, he gave this added assurance: “Look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The true disciples of Jesus Christ have not failed to obey his instructions to teach new disciples all the things he commanded. However, the outstanding growth in the worldwide congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses requires that we consider the special needs of newly baptized members of the congregation and unbaptized publishers as well as people who are studying the Bible with us and who perhaps are starting to attend congregation meetings with some degree of regularity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> At the beginning of the 1992 service year, approximately 1 out of every 9 publishers had been active in the ministry only one year. In addition, 1 out of 6 had been publishing three years or less; and 1 in 4 had been sharing in the ministry for no more than five years. Although many newer ones have made fine progress since becoming members of the congregation, further assistance in some respects would undoubtedly help speed up their spiritual progress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Hebrews 6:1 encourages all to “press on to maturity.” Christian maturity goes far beyond just putting in a service report. It involves progressing in personal study and regular meeting attendance as well as zealous participation in the field ministry. Helping others to come to a knowledge of the truth for salvation is also Involved. We must work at sharpening our skills in ‘reasoning from the Scriptures.’ (Acts 17:2) Growing to maturity requires time, and it depends to a great extent on our godly devotion and on our gaining practical experience in the field. Although we have control over the depth of our own godly devotion, it is the course of wisdom to allow other mature brothers and sisters to help us gain practical experience. We can learn from their experience, especially in the field ministry. We do not have to learn everything on our own by trial and error.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Help for Those Lacking Experience: </span><span class="font11">The pattern for giving assistance was set at the beginning of the Christian congregation. Jesus instructed his disciples. (Mark 3:14; Luke 9:1; 10:1) In turn, they taught others. Timothy received special encouragement and help from the apostle Paul, and the disciple Apollos progressed with personal assistance from the more experienced Aquila and Priscilla. (Acts 18:24-27; 1 Cor. 4:17) Mature members of the Christian congregation follow those examples today, teaching and encouraging the less experienced, especially newer ones and youths. As Romans 15:1, 2 says. “We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Parents are responsible for taking positive action to help their children progress spiritually. This involves family study, teaching the children how to study personally, regular meeting attendance and participation, and experience in applying what they learn. (Eph. 6:4; 1 Tim. 5:8) Congregation Book Study conductors especially should take the lead in making arrangements to help all in their book study and field service groups to progress in a spiritual way. The service overseer and other elders as well as ministerial servants and other members of the congregation also can help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Provide What Is Needed: </span><span class="font11">The need may be for assistance with only a certain aspect of Christian activities, such as personal study. A person may need suggestions for establishing a practical study schedule. Someone else could need help preparing comments or assignments. Others perhaps need to learn how to research Bible subjects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Many new ones need help in the field ministry. A publisher may want to become more effective in the house-to-house work, making return visits, or starting and conducting a Bible study. A few practice sessions using suggested introductions and presentations from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book or from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> may suffice. At other times, suggestions for a practical schedule for field service and help to stick with it may be all that is needed. Making definite arrangements to work with a person who needs assistance will enable him or her to progress toward specific objectives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> God’s Word encourages us to let our spiritual advancement be manifest to others. This was the counsel Paul wrote to his fellow worker Timothy. (1 Tim. 4:15) In harmony with that encouragement, the apostle emphasized the need to be training ourselves as for competing in an athletic contest or for successfully engaging in spiritual warfare. (1 Cor. 9:24-27; 2 Cor. 10:5, 6) We should be quick to apply all that we learn about God’s will so that observers will see in us living examples of true Christian faith. Likewise, we should be progressing in the art of teaching others to become dedicated disciples of Jesus Christ.—Jas. 1:22-25; 1 Tim. 4: 12-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Progress Involves Enduring Trials: </span><span class="font11">Even Jesus Christ learned valuable lessons from the things he suffered. (Heb. 5:8) So can we. Accordingly, spiritual advancement is enhanced when we take the positive attitude recommended at James 1:2, 3; “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance.” Thus, whether we have to cope with the challenge of chronic illnesses, economic difficulties, living in a divided household, opposition in the territory, or any number of other adverse circumstances, we have Jehovah’s assurance that with his help we can overcome and continue to progress in our worship of him. (1 Cor. 10:13; 2 Cor. 12:9; 1 Pet. 5:8-11) Success is achieved by steadfastness under all circumstances, ‘speaking the sacred pronouncements of God and ministering as dependent on the strength that God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.’—1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Accept Help Toward Further Progress: </span><span class="font11">If you are one who needs assistance in order to make further spiritual progress, be willing to accept help from a more experienced member of the congregation. Even if you have not been approached with an offer of help, you need not allow shyness to rob you of your opportunity to get help. Ask for assistance. Feel free to seek the help of any of the experienced ones in the congregation. Or you may ask your Congregation Book Study conductor, the service overseer, or any of the other elders for needed assistance.—Compare Genesis 32:26; Matthew 7: 7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> Certainly, it is a wonderful privilege to be included in the ever-increasing international “great crowd” streaming up to Jehovah’s mountain of pure worship. (Rev. 7:9) It is also a privilege to invite others to come with us in this ascent. With heartfelt appreciation, may we continue taking positive action toward further progress, building spirituality in ourselves and doing what we can to help others progress along with us in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We live in a world that exerts a strong influence toward ungodliness. The standards of this system continue to deteriorate. (2 Tim. 3:3) As Christians. we must take a stand for what is right and understand why we must continue to do so. But what direction and guidance is available? What standards should we follow? “Living With Soundness of Mind and Righteousness” is the encouraging theme selected for our special assembly day program for the 1993 service year—Titus 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> By means of talks, demonstrations, and experiences, we will learn how we can strengthen ourselves to resist ungodliness and to repudiate worldly desires. We will also see how it is possible to live with soundness of mind and righteousness amid this wicked system. Provisions for helping us safeguard our mental powers will be outlined. (1 Pet. 4:7) Parents and youths will especially want to give attention to the talks and interviews on the afternoon program. These will stress the need to gain godly wisdom and experience and to work together to build for a happy theocratic future.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>!</sup> Though surrounded by an ungodly world, God’s Word instructs us in the best course to follow. The benefits of heeding Bible counsel will be highlighted in the talk “Cherish Your Blessings Amid a Joyless World.” As we prepare to attend, we want to keep in mind that paying close attention to the program and applying the counsel will enable us to be more effective in our service to Jehovah.—Phil. 3:15,16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul knew the importance of being diligent in caring for those who showed an interest in the truth. He likened them to tender plants, which need regular watering and cultivation. (1 Cor. 3:6-9) Likewise today, interested ones need the tender care we give when we make return visits to cultivate their spiritual growth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is good to keep in mind that Individuals we call on will often need reminders to help them recall the points made in our previous discussion. Therefore. on each return visit it may be advisable to review briefly what you discussed on the previous call, focusing on the points the householder especially appreciated. Involve the householder in the discussion and readily discern his interests and needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> In making a return visit, whether the “Live Forever&quot; book was placed or not, you may want to use this direct approach for starting a study:</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'During the month of August, you might wish to use a presentation like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Good morning. We have been talking with some of the neighbors about what qualities they would like to see in a per</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">son who governs others</span><span class="font10">.

Cover just a few points and make definite arrangements to call again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Another approach could be:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I really enjoyed our discussion last week. Many people have expressed concern as to why we keep calling at their homes. I thought the comment made on page 29 of this book, You </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,</span><span class="font10"> would be of interest to you. [Read paragraph 11.) Based on what we read here, what would you say is required if our worship is to be acceptable to God? [Allow response and then commend the householder.) Back in Jesus’ day, there were those who thought their religion was acceptable to God.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Following up a previous visit where the “Live Forever” book was placed, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “The last time I visited, we discussed world conditions that need changing. Have you ever wondered why God permits wickedness?&quot; Allow response and turn to page 99, paragraph 2, noting the study questions. Read and discuss this paragraph, looking up the scriptures. You could add to the discussion by turning to selected illustrations in the book, for example, pages 78, 84-5, 119, 147,149-53, and 156-8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Where a Tract Was Left: </span><span class="font10">Sometimes a tract is left on the initial call. In making return visits, you could discuss one or two paragraphs from the tract along with the scriptures cited. Then show how one of the scriptures cited in the tract is discussed in greater detail in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book. If the individual manifests interest, you may want to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book and make arrangements to continue the discussion on your next visit.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">November 1992 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 35, No. 11</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Power of God’s Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Word of God is powerful. (Heb. 4:12) Today, evidence of this can be seen in the millions of lives that have been changed for the better as people have made personal application of the things they learn from the Bible. The same was true in the first century when the disciples of Jesus shared the knowledge of God's Word with others—Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In order for people to benefit from the Bible’s teachings, they need to recognize the Bible as the Word of God. (1 Thess. 2:13) During November we will be giving people the opportunity to learn more about the value of the Bible as we make the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> and the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font10"> available to those who are genuinely interested.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Why not review some of the interesting features of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font10"> book? The table of contents will lead you to chapters that discuss miracles, sup</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Value Our Literature?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Diamonds and other gemstones are valuable not only because of their beauty but also because of the high cost of finding them and mining them. The knowledge of Jehovah and Jesus Christ is of even more excelling value, and our publications are the only ones in the world that explain these spiritual riches in depth and with godly wisdom. (Rom. 11:33; Phil. 3:8) How can we demonstrate true appreciation for our literature?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A number of individuals and family groups regularly set aside a contribution to be taken to the Kingdom Hall and placed In one of the boxes labeled “Contributions for the Society’s Worldwide Work—Matthew 24:14.” Individuals make additional contributions to the worldwide work when they pick up supplies of literature or magazines and when they deposit contributions received in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Another way to demonstrate appreciation is to be selective in offering literature to people we meet in field service. We would not think of giving an expensive diamond to an infant, who posed contradictions, scientific harmony, prophecies, and other subjects. There are many photographs and illustrations. Scholarly references are listed in the back of the book. These features will enable us to present the book with genuine enthusiasm, firmly convinced that people in our territory need to hear the good news it contains.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* How can we use this book when we encounter a householder who already believes that the Bible is God’s Word? Interest may be cultivated by highlighting either chapter 2, which relates the historical account of the Bible’s fight to live, or chapter 14, which encourages the reader to accept help in order to have a better understanding of the meaning of the Bible for us today. Reading the scriptures noted in chapter 14 will assure the householder that your discussion is Bible-based.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Many refuse to accept the Bible as the word of God because of the conduct could not comprehend its value. Neither do we give valuable literature to individuals who have no appreciation for spiritual things. (Compare Hebrews 12:16.) Our generous giving of ourselves and our literature should be regulated by a discerning attitude. Is the householder willing to converse? Does he pay attention when we speak, respond to questions we ask, and follow along as we read from the Bible? If such interest is manifest, we are glad to leave an appropriate publication. When we conduct studies in our publications, people are helped to learn what the Bible teaches and the way is opened for them to build a relationship with Jehovah. The true benefit to be derived from our literature is determined by how it is used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Literature left on a shelf at the Kingdom Hall or in our home is not accomplishing its purpose, and its value is not being realized. Even older issues of the magazines, brochures, bound books, and tracts should be put to good use. When was the last time we took an Inventory of the supply of literof Christendom. Chapter 3, “The Bible’s False Friend.&quot; can be used effectively in this situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> When we read from our Bible, the householder may comment on the clarity of language used in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> Or we may find that the householder shows interest in our message but does not have a Bible. In these cases we may describe the unique features of the Bible we use and the reasons why we prefer it to others. Among other things, we could point to the list “Bible Words Indexed” that helps to locate familiar scriptures. Also, the feature “Bible Topics for Discussion&quot; at the back of the Bible can help interested ones find answers to many commonly asked questions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ By means of the Bible, Jehovah has made known his dealings with mankind and has thus acquainted us with his marvelous personality. May we use the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font10"> book effectively in helping others to learn about Jehovah and the power of his Word!—2 Cor. 10:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ature we already have on hand? We may be surprised to discover how much has accumulated. Is the literature we have still in good condition—not yellowed with age, tom, or soiled? If so, we should make every effort to distribute this in the field ministry. Damaged literature can be retained for personal use or appropriately discarded. Even while concentrating primarily on the current offer, we may decide at times to use a different publication.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Always give careful thought to how much literature you actually need for distribution purposes. Good judgment is necessary. While an adequate quantity is essential, especially if you are pioneering, there is no need to maintain a large personal supply of literature, since more can be obtained at the Kingdom Hall before and after meetings. Equip yourself with sufficient literature to get the month started and get more as your supply is used up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Our publications are most valuable when placed in the hands of people who appreciate God’s Word of truth. May all of us be wise and discreet in the use of what has been provided, thus showing how highly we value our literature.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Looking to Jehovah in All We Undertake</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We need God’s blessing on all we undertake. The wisdom of our realizing this is well stated at Psalm 127:1: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.” Thus, we should make sure that we consider the Creator in all our activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Observed by Others: </span><span class="font11">Today, those acquainted with construction methods are greatly impressed with what Jehovah’s Witnesses are accomplishing in erecting quickly built Kingdom Halls. For example, in one area a local newspaper commented: “It was an invasion of the Jehovah[’s] Witness Volunteer labor force who came for the three-day. ‘Kingdom Hall Building Project,’ and a three-day project it was.... In three days the Kingdom Hall Building Committee had come and gone, but what they accomplished will long be remembered.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Another newspaper observed: “You haven’t seen a pile of brick and lumber become a building until you’ve watched a group of Jehovah(’s] Witnesses swing a hammer. Before your very eyes, a building constructed by the Witnesses goes from a simple concrete slab to studded walls, room partitions and a roof in less time than it would take a couple of ordinary carpenters to get their supplies and tools together.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In Montana, where someone likened the project to a barn raising, a reporter observed: “Barn raising? Maybe —but barn raising elevated to the precision of a moon mission launch and the efficiency of an Indianapolis 500 pit-stop crew.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It is gratifying to see that tens of thousands of volunteers have offered to assist with these Kingdom Hall construction projects. Such a willing spirit is indeed commendable and is in harmony with the statement at Psalm 110:3: “Your people will offer themselves willingly.” One city overseer noted: “We are one big family working together to build a Kingdom Hall.&quot; However, more and more skilled and general workers are needed as the construction of new Kingdom Halls throughout the country continues. It is as the headlines of one newspaper stated, “Many hands make for light work.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> What a memorable experience it is to share in such a project! One Witness commented: “It is really difficult to put into words exactly how it felt to see our own Kingdom Hall being built. I think this project of working together made us feel like a family, knowing that each one did his part, whether it was picking up nails or fastening the shingles. Our unity and organization surely proved that we have Jehovah’s backing. This is a summer we will all remember as being special.” After working on a Kingdom Hall project, someone wrote, “I’m still studying in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship </span><span class="font11">book. This project was a superb demonstration of the unity that is described in the book. There are no arguments. Working side by side this way with the brothers has made me feel a lot closer to them. I really feel a part of this organization. There’s no other way of life. No one can walk away from such an experience and feel alone. Jehovah’s spirit is here!&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>0ne newspaper openly admitted: “Jehovah’s Witnesses’ success in the ‘quick build’ of their places of worship is found not only in cooperation, but dedication.” A faculty member of a university visited a nearby building project and commented: “This is wonderful! As I drove up, I saw license plates from all over Nebraska and several other states. You know they can talk all they want to about their formal religion, but this is a true Christian spirit”—Neh. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’Others may even be moved to express support, as did a businessman in the neighborhood where a new Kingdom Hall was built. After the building was finished, he came over before a Sunday meeting and, saying that he wanted to be a good neighbor, made a contribution to help out with the project.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Designing and Locating Kingdom Halls: </span><span class="font11">So that dedicated resources may be used wisely, careful consideration must be given to Kingdom Hall design and location. The buildings should be modest. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font11"> book emphasizes on page 61 that “the Kingdom Hall, as a place of worship, should not be a pretentious building designed to impress others.... Its purpose is functional. (Compare Acts 17:24.) It should be a comfortable and convenient place for conducting Christian meetings that help us to grow spiritually and to learn about Jehovah, and that encourage us to share in his Kingdom service.” Experience has shown that generally the publishers are best served by a Kingdom Hall when it is located as close as possible to where they live.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> It is usually preferable to have two separate Kingdom Halls in different locations rather than a doubleauditorium Kingdom Hall. Each of these may accommodate two or more congregations if their location is wisely chosen. However, in some situations two Kingdom Halls have been built on the same site. The high cost of property in some densely populated urban areas has made this necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> Several factors should be considered before undertaking the construction of a multiple-auditorium facility: How far removed from the territory of each congregation is the building? Is the facility easily accessible? Would Bible students and other newly interested ones attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall when it is not close to where they live? Might the initial enthusiasm of the publishers wane because of the extra travel time and expense over a prolonged period of time? What impact would a multiple-auditorium Kingdom Hall have on the surrounding community? As more congregations use a Kingdom Hall, more traffic is generated for the area. Would this cause difficulties with the neighbors, especially in residential areas? Would it cause traffic or parking problems? Careful consideration needs to be given to these and other pertinent factors from the outset if congregations are considering the possibility of constructing a Kingdom Hall with more than one auditorium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> What Has Been Accomplished: </span><span class="font11">Since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established nine years ago, funds have been made available to assist in constructing 1,129 new Kingdom Halls in this country. These Kingdom Halls accommodate 1,675 congregations. What an outstanding expression of Christian love! Each year about 200 new Kingdom Halls are built, and another 200 existing Kingdom Halls are remodeled. Thousands of brothers and sisters lovingly give of themselves to assist congregations with their Kingdom Hall construction projects. (Phil. 2:4) Many of these volunteers also help with district convention and circuit assembly work, and some brothers are on other special assignments from the Society, such as Hospital Liaison Committees and Assembly Hall Committees.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Those serving on the Regional Building Committees are certainly to be commended for their generous and willing spirit in helping meet the massive building needs within Jehovah’s expanding organization. “Their willing spirit affects all of us,” reported one</span></p>

As a local committee, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Society for making such a provision. Without this provision and the help of Jehovah’s holy spirit, this project would never have succeeded.” Such sentiments expressed about the leadership of a Regional Building Committee are certainly felt by many, many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>H</sup> More Volunteers Needed: </span><span class="font11">With the continuing increase in congregations, there is a need for more Kingdom Halls. Additional finances and workers are needed to meet this demand. During the last service year, the number of congregations in the United States increased by 261, and more Kingdom Halls are required to accommodate these new congregations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1S</sup> While many brothers and sisters continue to assist with Kingdom Hall construction, giving freely of their time and effort, there is a call for more help just as there is a need for more workers in the harvest field. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Most regional committees report that having additional willing workers available for Kingdom Hall projects will lighten the load of those who have been carrying this responsibility for years.—Isa. 6:8; Gal. 6:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> Brothers who apply for this avenue of theocratic service should be mindful of following through with their commitment. (Matt. 5:37; Col. 3:23, 24) Department overseers make direct contact with the volunteers to let them know when they are scheduled on a construction site. Plans are made depending upon the stated availability of the volunteers. Thus, it is important that all report as agreed upon, since each department needs to care for its work at a set time so that other departments can keep their work on schedule. Scheduling the work in this manner makes it possible for workers to return to their families and home congregations just as soon as their portion of the work is completed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>17</sup> Each Regional Building Committee schedules the workers within its assigned area. This works well, since the responsible brothers are careful to schedule workers so that they are not burdened or imposed upon. Workers are not asked to help out in another committee’s area except by special arrangement through the Society and upon request from a regional committee that is temporarily overloaded. If another nearby regional committee has a light load at the time, the Society may ask it to assist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Who Qualify: </span><span class="font11">Whenever a Kingdom Hall building project is undertaken, volunteers from the congrega-tion(s) that will use the new or renovated facility and from nearby congregations provide the general labor force. Some of these become trained and thereafter qualify as experienced or even skilled workers so that they can submit Kingdom Hall Construction Worker Questionnaires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>19</sup> Those specifically needed by the Regional Building Committees month by month are those who have</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">experience in the construction trades and who volunteer to assist with needed Kingdom Hall construction. These must be in good standing in the congregation and approved by the local body of elders. If you are in this category, could you arrange your affairs to assist with this feature of Jehovah’s service? (Neh. 4:6) If so, obtain a Kingdom Hall Construction Worker Questionnaire from the presiding overseer or secretary in your congregation and submit it right away.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>20</sup> Additionally, there are spiritually mature brothers who are serving as elders and ministerial servants and who have potential for oversight. Although their construction experience may be limited, these also may submit questionnaires. Many in this category help with nonconstruction departments. Others are trained so that they can be used more extensively in the future. Elders and ministerial servants are encouraged to consider seriously whether they can make themselves available for this work that brings praise to our Father, Jehovah.—Compare 1 Samuel 3:8; Matthew 4:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> All Can Have a Share: </span><span class="font11">All can show a fine spirit toward this essential activity by taking up the slack in the congregation when some are working on a Kingdom Hall project for a portion of a weekend. Certainly none of us would want to discourage these volunteer workers in any way by intimating that their labors of love in Kingdom Hall construction are not sacred service. (Prov. 24:10; Heb. 6:10) Of course, balance is needed, and that is why the Regional Building Committees are thorough in working out schedules so that volunteers are not away unduly from their home congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>22</sup> Even if circumstances may not permit our volunteering in connection with actual construction work, there is one vital aspect of the matter in which all may share. What is that? Honoring Jehovah with our “valuable things.” (Prov. 3:9) We can be confident that Jehovah is highly pleased when we give loving financial support toward more Kingdom Hall construction. The contributions to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund are very much appreciated, and as more congregations are formed, the need for new and improved facilities continues. (Acts 20:35; 2 Cor. 9:6, 7) In the first century, when a need arose, the apostle Paul encouraged the Corinthians: “Nevertheless, just as you are abounding in everything, in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in this love of ours to you, may you also abound in this kind giving.”—2 Cor. 8:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Far-Reaching Benefits: </span><span class="font11">Since Regional Building Committees are provided with guidelines from the Society and additional training, congregations building or renovating Kingdom Halls can benefit by seeking advice from these committees. Elders are wise to contact the Regional Building Committee before purchasing property and then work closely with these experienced brothers throughout the project.—Prov. 15:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>24</sup> Truly, Jehovah is greatly helping us to erect many houses of worship to his praise. Brothers and sisters are being moved by a self-sacrificing love. This is exactly the type of love that Jesus said would clearly identify his genuine followers. (John 13:34,35) Just as Jesus put the interests of others ahead of his own, so do they. Very likely, the willingness and increasing skill of Jehovah’s servants will be employed with even greater benefit in God’s new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>25</sup> Yes, those who share in constructing buildings for the worship of Jehovah find Psalm 127:1 to be true. Though skilled workers volunteer their time and effort for the quick erection of fine Kingdom Halls, it is Jehovah’s blessing that guarantees success. Today, even more Kingdom Halls are needed. Since its inception, the Society Kingdom Hall Fund has been able to assist many congregations with their Kingdom Hall projects. May all of us continue to give freely of our time and “valuable things” as we look to Jehovah to bless our efforts.—Prov. 3:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Do not be quick to discard older issues of the magazines when receiving the newer ones.

<p><span class="font10">* By always using appropriate talking points, we may motivate others to read our magazines and perhaps start such ones on the road to life.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Making effective return visits becomes easier when we lay the proper groundwork on the Initial call. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book can help us do that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The following presentation is based on the second introduction on page 10 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, under the heading “Bible/God.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After a friendly greeting, say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ &quot;We find that more and more people today feel uncertain as to where they can find practical answers to mounting everyday problems. Have you found that to be true? [Allow for response.] It used to be that people looked to the Bible for help. But now many say they have doubts. How do you feel about the Bible?” If the householder expresses skepticism about its authenticity, take out the tract Why </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Trust the Bible</span><span class="font10"> and read the second and third paragraphs on page 2. If the householder agrees that the Bible is God’s Word, look up and read the scriptures cited in the second paragraph on page 2 of the tract, and briefly discuss these with him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> If there are many in your territory who express disbelief, try adapting the fifth Introduction on page 10 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book to arouse their interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “In view of all the conflicts in the world today, many sincere people find it difficult to believe in God. Or if they do believe in him, they do not believe he can solve the problems we face. How do you feel? [Allow for response.] Notice what this tract has to say about men, science, and the Bible.” Then begin reading the fifth paragraph on page 3 of the tract Wfty </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Trust the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Raise Questions From the Tract to Set Up Your Next Visit: </span><span class="font10">Plan for your initial call to be only the beginning of a series of fruitful visits. Do not feel that you need to go into much detail; neither should you be so abrupt that the householder feels you are not genuinely interested in him. After reading two or three paragraphs from the tract, raise a question that can be discussed on a future visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> For example, you could direct attention to the third paragraph on page 4 and ask: “Do you think the Bible provides enough evidence to trust what it says about the future?” This will establish a reference point for the return visit, when you might consider chapters 9 and 10 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —God’s Word or Man’s?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> If the householder is genuinely interested and seems to appreciate the information presented, you may wish to offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font10"> book on the initial call. Or if the situation warrants, you may offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> Where appropriate, briefly explain that our work is supported by voluntary donations and that you would be pleased to accept a small contribution for that purpose.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ If we view each householder as a potential disciple, we will endeavor to use our concluding remarks to lay the groundwork for a return visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> From one dictionary we learn that “cultivate” means to prepare for or foster growth. But this word can also mean to improve by labor, care, or study. Making disciples is an important objective of our ministry. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Therefore, we need to put forth effort to cultivate the interest we find in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Repeated visits are usually required to foster the spiritual growth of honesthearted individuals. Productive return visits should lead to a regular Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do you call back only on those who show great interest? You do not need to place literature in order to return. One pioneer who does not usually leave much literature on the initial visit calls back on everyone who is friendly. A good discussion in which you share a Scriptural thought provides a fine basis for a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use Tracts to Start Bible Studies on Return Visits: </span><span class="font10">The various subjects of our tracts are relevant for our day. They emphasize the need for taking in Bible knowledge and applying it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Last time we talked about some reasons for putting trust in the Bible. What kind of future does the Bible talk about?&quot; Begin reading from the second paragraph on page 3 of the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World. </span><span class="font10">Look up the scriptures. Ask the householder for his reaction to what you are reading. Conclude by considering the material under the subheading “How It Is Possible for You” on page 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In a similar manner, you could use the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “As we considered briefly before, many people lack confidence in God. For example, they ask, ‘If God is so powerful, why does he allow people to die?' This tract can help answer that question.&quot; Call attention to the section beginning with the fourth paragraph on page 2. Ask a relevant question after each paragraph, and consider cited scriptures that are not quoted. If your congregation now has a supply of the new brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?,</span><span class="font10"> it could be used in a similar way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Continuing the Study: </span><span class="font10">By following the methods suggested here, you are starting a home Bible study.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">—A Work of Compassion</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Jesus observed that the multitudes who listened to his message were “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) With tenderness and love, he taught them Jehovah’s ways, brought comfort, and compassionately ministered to their spiritual needs. As we meditate upon his ways, we learn to think and feel as Jesus did, and this quality of compassion becomes evident in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Just take a moment to think about how Jesus responded when people who were desperate for help approached him. (Luke 5:12, 13; 8:43-48) He was considerate of those with special circumstances. (Mark 7:3135) He was aware of the feelings of others and showed concern. He looked beyond outward appearances. (Luke 7:36-40) Indeed, Jesus perfectly reflected the tender compassion of our God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> “Moved With Pity”: </span><span class="font0">Jesus did not conduct his ministry out of a mere sense of duty. He was “moved with pity” for people. (Mark 6:34) Similarly today, we are not just delivering a message but trying to save precious lives. Seek to understand why people respond the way they do. Why are they anxious or preoccupied? Have they been neglected and blinded by false religious shepherds? Our genuine interest in others may move them to listen to the good news.—2 Cor. 6:4, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Compassion touches hearts. To illustrate: One woman suffered the tragic loss of her three-month-old daughter. When two Witnesses called at her door, she invited them in with the intention of refuting their arguments about why God permits suffering. However, the woman later said: “They listened to me with great compassion, and when they were leaving, I felt so much better that I agreed to another visit.” Do you strive to show compassion to everyone you meet in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Cultivating compassion will help us to share real comfort with others. Doing so, we glorify “the Father of tender mercies,” Jehovah.—2 Cor. 1:3.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest —By Offering Commendation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Sincere commendation lifts people’s spirits, motivates them to action, and brings them joy. Many publishers have found that just a brief word of sincere commendation often helps in gaining a listening ear in the ministry. How can we commend people as we seek to share the good news with them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Observant: </span><span class="font0">The glorified Jesus Christ took note of the good deeds of the seven congregations in Asia Minor. (Rev. 2:2, 3, 13, 19; 3:8) Similarly, genuine interest in the people we meet in our ministry will move us to look for opportunities to give commendation. For example, a well-kept yard, a parent demonstrating tender affection toward his children, or a householder’s friendly smile and greeting all give us opportunities to offer commendation. Do you readily observe and take advantage of such opportunities?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be a Good Listener: </span><span class="font0">When preaching to others, invite them to express themselves by asking them appropriate questions. Show them honor by paying close attention to what they say. (Rom. 12:10) Likely, you will find something for which you can offer sincere commendation and then be able to build on the common ground you establish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use Discernment: </span><span class="font0">What should we do if a householder says something that is not in harmony with Bible truth? Rather than take issue with an incorrect statement, acknowledge the householder’s words and continue with an expression such as “I can see that you have given this subject a lot of thought.” (Col. 4:6) Even if a person is argumentative, we can often commend him for his genuine interest in the subject. Such a mild approach may soften one who seems to be firmly opposed to the good news. —Prov. 25:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> To be of value, the commendation we offer must be sincere. The use of such upbuilding speech honors Jehovah and may attract others to the Kingdom message.</span></p>

A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>How to Reach Your Spiritual Goals</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> As a young Christian, no doubt your goals in life are influenced by your love for Jehovah and by Jesus’ words to all Christians to ‘seek first the kingdom.’ (Matt. 6:33) Your goal may be to expand your ministry by serving as a pioneer or to serve where the need for Kingdom proclaimers is greater. Some may have in mind volunteering for international construction work, for serving in a branch, or for working in the missionary field. What fulfilling and commendable goals these are!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> An aid to reaching your spiritual goals is to put them in writing. The July 15, 2004, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> said: “An abstract idea takes on clarity and form when [you] choose words to express it. [You] may therefore wish to commit [your] goals and the strategy for reaching them to paper.” In addition, intermediate goals can help you to measure your progress and maintain your focus as you pursue a long-term goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Short-Term Goals: </span><span class="font0">If you are not yet baptized, consider what you need to do in order to reach that goal. You may need a better understanding of basic Bible teachings. If so, make it your goal to study thoroughly the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book, looking up all the cited scriptures. (1 Tim. 4:15) Set a goal also to read the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, as Bethelites and Gilead students are required to do. After that, maintain a regular program of daily Bible reading. (Ps. 1:2, 3) Imagine how that would help you to grow spiritually! Open and close each period of Bible reading and study with heartfelt prayer, and always seek to apply what you learn.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> If you are already baptized, what further goals could you pursue? Do you need to improve your preaching skills? For example, could you make it your aim to become more adept at using God’s Word in the field ministry? (2 Tim. 2:15) How might you expand your ministry? Set specific short-term goals that are in accord with your age and circumstances and that will help you to reach your long-term goals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> A Success Story: </span><span class="font0">When 19-year-old Tony visited a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a desire was awakened within him to serve at Bethel. However, his lifestyle had been wayward, and he had not even made a dedication to God. Tony decided to harmonize his life with Jehovah's ways and made it his goal to qualify for baptism. After achieving that goal, he reached out for auxiliary pioneering and then regular pioneering, writing on his calendar the dates he wanted to start. Imagine his joy when after pioneering for some time, he was invited to serve at Bethel!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> You too can reach your spiritual goals as you seek Kingdom interests first. Keep “your works” before Jehovah in prayer and strive diligently to attain them.—Prov. 16:3; 21:5.</span></p></li></ul>

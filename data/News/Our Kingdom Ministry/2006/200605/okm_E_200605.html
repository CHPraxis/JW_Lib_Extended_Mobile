<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Follow Me Continually”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many people center their lives on pleasing themselves, yet often they are unhappy. In contrast, Jesus recommended a course of unselfish giving that brings real happiness. (Acts 20: 35) He said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself . . . and follow me continually.” (Mark 8:34) This involves more than denying oneself certain pleasures from time to time. It means living each day to please, not ourselves, but Jehovah.—Rom. 14:8; 15:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Consider the apostle Paul’s example. Because of “the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,” Paul left off pursuing personal aspirations and devoted himself to advancing Kingdom interests. (Phil. 3:7, 8) “For my part,” he said, “I will most gladly spend and be completely spent” in serving others. (2 Cor, 12:15) Each of us does well to ask: ‘How am I using my time, energy, abilities, and resources? Am I focused on furthering my own interests, or am I seeking to please Jehovah?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Opportunities to Give: </span><span class="font12">Each year, God’s people devote more than a billion hours to the lifesaving work of Kingdom preaching. Within the congregation, young and old alike care for a variety of assignments that benefit others. There is also much work that is done in connection with assemblies and conventions as well as in the construction and maintenance of buildings used to advance true worship. And think of the loving assistance provided by brothers who serve on Hospital Liaison Committees and Patient Visitation Groups. All such self-sacrificing efforts are a blessing to our Christian brotherhood!—Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Opportunities to give of ourselves in various ways can arise when a disaster or an emergency occurs. More often, though, we may simply discern that a fellow Christian needs assistance or encouragement. (Prov. 17:17) When we readily extend ourselves to serve others and advance Kingdom interests, we are following Jesus’ example. (Phil. 2:5-8) May we strive to do so continually.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—By Being Gracious</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah is gracious.” (Ps. 145:8) Although he is the Universal Sovereign, he is kind, considerate, and courteous in his dealings with imperfect humans. (Gen. 13:14; 19:18-21, 29) We can enhance our presentation of the good news by imitating our gracious God. (Col. 4:6) This involves more than simply being polite and respectful in our speech.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> From Door to Door: </span><span class="font12">What if we visit the householder at an inopportune time or when he is too busy to speak with us? We do well to acknowledge such circumstances by keeping our presentation very brief or by offering to return at another time. We kindly refrain from insisting that people accept literature if they choose to decline. Consideration for others will also prompt us to show respect for their property, such as by closing gates and doors and by training our children to do the same. We should make sure that any literature left at not-at-homes is out of sight. Indeed, graciousness will move us to treat others just as we would want them to treat us.—Luke 6:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> In Street Work: </span><span class="font12">While engaging in street work, we can show courtesy by not blocking the flow of pedestrians and by not congregating in front of businesses. We will be sensitive to the circumstances of others, seeking to speak with those who may have a few minutes rather than those who are clearly in a hurry. At times, we may need to speak up in order to be heard over street noise. Yet, we should do so with dignity, not calling attention to ourselves.—Matt. 12:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> When Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font12">Consideration for others will move us to do telephone witnessing in a place where background noise can be controlled. We show good manners when we readily identify ourselves and explain the reason for our call. Speaking directly into the mouthpiece and maintaining a pleasant tone will help to engage others in an upbuilding Scriptural conversation. (1 Cor. 14:8, 9) By being kind, considerate, and courteous in these various ways, we imitate our gracious God, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">He enjoyed a warm, intimate relationship with God. He devoted his life to the doing of Jehovah’s will. He “walked with the true God” and was blessed for doing so. He was Noah, an example worthy of imitation by young and old alike.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During the past five years, 633 Kingdom Halls have been built, 1,193 remodeled, and 1,785 repaired in the United States branch territory. We sincerely appreciate the hard work of the Regional Building Committees and all who assisted them. While a tremendous amount of work has been accomplished, there is still much to be done in Kingdom Hall construction. How can all of us support this important aspect of our sacred service to Jehovah?—Rev. 7:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Willing: </span><span class="font12">If you are a baptized publisher, we invite you to make yourself available to work with the Regional Building Committee by filling out a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire.</span><span class="font12"> (Ps. 110:3) All who volunteer must be willing workers and have a spirit of cooperation. (Ps. 133:1) Even if you do not have construction skills, you can still contribute much to the success of a building project. You may also receive training that will allow you to be used more extensively in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you are unable to volunteer, you can show your support by encouraging others who are able to participate in the arrangement. You can help to cover the assignments in the congregation of those who are away. By planning ahead, elders can make sure that the congregation is well cared for when some are working on a Kingdom Hall</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">3. In what other ways can we show our support for this arrangement? </span><span class="font12">project. Undoubtedly, Jehovah is pleased when we work together unitedly for the advancement of Kingdom interests.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Positive: </span><span class="font12">Building places of worship involves much time and hard work. Understandably, then, those invited to assist on building projects will be away from their home congregations at times. May we be quick to offer commendation and encouragement to construction volunteers, who make sacrifices to care for this “necessary business.”—Acts 6:3; Rom. 14:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Be Balanced: </span><span class="font12">Preaching about God’s Kingdom is our primary theocratic activity. (Mark 13:10) With this in mind, Regional Building Committees endeavor to schedule projects so that volunteers are not required to be away from their congregations unnecessarily. Likewise, construction volunteers strive to be balanced in caring for their many responsibilities. They take the initiative to make sure that their congregation assignments are cared for when they are away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The apostle Paul described the members of the congregation as working together in unity “for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.” (Eph. 4:16) Our love for Jehovah and for true worship moves us to cooperate together to get the good news preached and to support Kingdom Hall construction.</span></p></li></ul>

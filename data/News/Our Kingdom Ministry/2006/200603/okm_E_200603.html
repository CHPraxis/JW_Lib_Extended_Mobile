<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Help Others to Benefit From the Ransom</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial of Christ’s Death to Be Observed on April 12</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.” (2 Cor. 9:15) Those words well express how we feel about the goodness and loving-kindness that God extends to his people through his Son, Jesus Christ. Such appreciation will be especially evident as we gather together on April 12 to observe the Memorial of Christ’s death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Along with Jehovah’s servants, some ten million others attend the Memorial observance each year. In so doing, they demonstrate a measure of appreciation for Christ’s sacrifice. However, to benefit from the ransom, they need to exercise faith in it. (John 3: 16, 36) How can we help them to develop such faith? During this Memorial season, we can encourage them to have a personal Bible study and to attend the weekly congregation meetings. Consider the following suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Bible Studies: </span><span class="font12">When you invite interested ones to the Memorial, why not try to start a Bible study with them in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book? Offer to explain the Memorial observance to the person by opening to pages 206-8 and considering the topic “The Lord’s Evening Meal—An Observance That Honors God.” You may be able to consider that information in one or two visits, perhaps as a Bi ble study at the doorstep. When you have completed that material, the person may be willing to discuss chapter 5, “The Ransom —God’s Greatest Gift.” Once a regular Bible study has been established, go back and consider the opening four chapters of the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> With whom can we start a Bible study</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What is one way that God’s people express their appreciation for the ransom?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Who along with Jehovah’s servants attend the Memorial observance, and what do they need to do in order to benefit from the ransom?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How might we start a Bible study when extending an invitation to the Memorial?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. With whom can we start a Bible study during this Memorial season?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">using this approach? Perhaps some of your workmates, schoolmates, or neighbors would agree to such discussions. Brothers might approach the unbelieving husbands of sisters in the congregation. And do not overlook your own non-Witness relatives. In addition, we will want to make a special effort to extend a Memorial invitation to those who were once actively associated with the congregation. (Luke 15:3-7) May we seek to help all such ones to benefit from the ransom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font12">The Memorial is the first meeting that many Bible students and other interested ones attend. How, though, can we encourage them to benefit from our other congregation meetings? The April 2005 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> page 8, offered the following suggestions: “Mention the title of the next public talk. Show them the material that will be considered at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study and at the Congregation Book Study. Describe the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting. When you have an assignment in the school, perhaps you could rehearse it with them. Share outstanding points that were presented at the meetings. Use photographs in our publications to help them visualize what takes place. From the very first study, invite them to attend.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When honesthearted ones have a regular Bible study and attend congregation meetings regularly, they often make rapid spiritual progress. May we, therefore, encourage others to take advantage of these spiritual provisions and to benefit from God’s greatest gift—the ransom.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5. How can we encourage Bible students and other interested ones to attend the weekly congregation meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">6. In what two ways can we help honesthearted ones to benefit from the ransom?</span></p>

Then invite the audience to comment on the following questions without having the paragraphs read: (par. 2) When did Jesus institute the Memorial of his death? (par. 3) How often should the Lord's Evening Meal be observed? (par. 4) How does the Bible describe the Memorial observance? (par. 5) How do we know that Jesus did not turn the bread into his literal flesh and the wine into his blood? (par. 6) What does the unleavened bread symbolize? (par. 7) What does the red wine represent? (par. 8) Who only should partake of the bread and the wine? (par. 9) When is the Memorial held each year, and why should we attend? Highlight key scriptures as time permits. Encourage all to consider this information with Bible students and others whom they invite to the Memorial by reading the paragraphs, discussing the main points, and using simple questions, such as those provided in this part.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Teach Meek Ones to Walk in God’s Way</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> First-century disciples of Christ were spoken of as belonging to “The Way.” (Acts 9:2) True Christianity involves a person’s entire way of life. (Prov. 3:5, 6) When conducting Bible studies, therefore, we need to do more than impart accurate knowledge of Bible doctrine. We must also help Bible students to walk in Jehovah’s way.—Ps. 25:8, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Love for Jehovah and for Jesus: </span><span class="font11">What a challenge it is for imperfect people to bring their thinking, attitudes, speech, and conduct into harmony with God’s will! (Rom. 7:21-23; Eph. 4:22-24) However, love for God and his Son motivates meek ones to undertake this challenge. (John 14:15; 1 John 5:3) How can we help our Bible students to cultivate this love?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Help your student to get to know the kind of person Jehovah is. One brother explained, “People cannot love a person they don’t know, so from the very beginning of the study, I teach them God’s name from the Bible, and I look for opportunities to emphasize Jehovah’s qualities.” Highlighting Jesus’ example is an excellent way to do this. (John 1:14; 14:9) In addition, make use of the review box at the conclusion of each chapter of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book to help the student reflect on the marvelous qualities of God and his Son.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Teach by Example: </span><span class="font11">As teachers and guides, we show others by our actions what it means to walk in God’s way. (1 Cor. 11:1) For example, most Bible students are not accustomed to approaching strangers in order to share their beliefs. Therefore, it may require patience and skill to help them to develop the love, faith, and courage needed to participate in the work of preaching and making disciples. (2 Cor. 4:13; 1 Thess. 2:2) Our desire to guide our students will move us to be at their side when they take their first steps in the Christian ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Your example can instruct students in other important aspects of Christian living. When you visit the sick or warmly greet others at congregation meetings, they see love in action. (John 15:12) When you share in cleaning the Kingdom Hall or do helpful things for others, you are teaching them how to serve. (John 13:12-15) When they observe that you maintain a simple lifestyle, they see what it means to ‘keep on seeking first the kingdom.’—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The work of teaching others from God’s Word and of making disciples involves much effort. But what a joy it is to see meek ones “go on walking in the truth”!—3 John 4.</span></p></li></ul>

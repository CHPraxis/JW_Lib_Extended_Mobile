<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Maintain Zeal</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> The ardor with which Apollos carried out his ministry may remind us of fellow Christians today who are especially zealous in the preaching work. (Acts 18:24-28) All of us, though, are admonished: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit.” (Rom. 12:11) What can help us to acquire and maintain zeal for the Christian ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Fueled by Knowledge: </span><span class="font1">After Jesus appeared to two of his disciples and “interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures,” they remarked: “Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road?” (Luke 24:27, 32) Likewise, do not our hearts burn with excitement when we gain an increased understanding of God’s Word? Yes, faith is fueled by knowledge. Romans 10:17 explains: “Faith follows the thing heard.” When our hearts are filled with confidence in Jehovah's promises, we simply cannot stop speaking about the things we have learned!—Ps. 145:7; Acts 4:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> We cannot rely solely on the knowledge that we have gained through previous study to keep our love for God strong and our zeal for his service burning brightly. We must continue to broaden our understanding of the truth and deepen our love for Jehovah. Otherwise, our service to him could gradually become perfunctory. (Rev. 2:4) God’s Word urges us to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“go on . . . increasing</span><span class="font1"> in the accurate knowledge of God.”—Col. 1: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Our Study Habits: </span><span class="font1">We do well, therefore, to examine our study habits. For example, we may be able to mark the answers in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study article and to offer correct comments. But do we look up the cited scriptures and reflect on how the material applies in our life? With the weekly Bible reading, do we make an effort to do additional research if our circumstances permit and to meditate on the lessons contained therein? (Ps. 77:11, 12; Prov. 2:1-5) How beneficial it is to ponder over and be absorbed in God’s Word! (1 Tim. 4: 15, 16) Such meaningful study will nourish our hearts and energize us to be “zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:14.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest —By Good Eye Contact</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> When witnessing publicly and from house to house, we often establish eye contact with people before we begin to speak. In that brief moment, we may be able to sense from their facial expression how they feel about our presence and even what mood they are in. Likewise, they can discern much about us. One woman said this about the visit of a Witness: “What I remember about her smiling face was the peace. I was Intrigued.” This opened the way for the woman to listen to the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Establishing eye contact with others is an effective way to lead into a witness when doing street work or witnessing in other public places. One brother watches the eyes of thoSe approaching him. When he makes eye contact, he smiles and then presents the magazines. Using this approach, he enjoys many pleasant conversations and places much literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Discern the Feelings of Others: </span><span class="font1">Maintaining eye contact will help us to discern the feelings of others. For example, if someone has difficulty understanding us or disagrees with something we have said, it will usually show in his face. If he is busy or is growing impatient, we will sense it by observing his facial expression. We can then adjust or abbreviate our presentation accordingly. Being sensitive to the feelings of others is a fine way to demonstrate our personal interest in them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Sincerity and Conviction: </span><span class="font1">In many cultures, looking a person in the eye is viewed as evidence that one is sincere. Notice how Jesus responded when his disciples asked: “Who really can be saved?” The Bible reports: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Looking them in the face,</span><span class="font1"> Jesus said to them: ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.’” (Matt. 19:25, 26) No doubt the conviction in Jesus’ eyes added weight to his words. In like manner, maintaining good eye contact will help us to convey the Kingdom message with sincerity and conviction.—2 Cor. 2: 17; 1 Thess. 1:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span><span class="font15">A Service Meeting will be scheduled in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font15">for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Deliverance at Hand!&quot; District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of convention highlights. This is not to be a review of the entire convention program. Rather, highlight only the parts that deal directly with field service activity. In-' vite the audience to comment on how they are applying that information in their ministry.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Conduct Progressive Doorstep and Telephone Bible Studies</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> What a joy it is to start a Bible study! However, finding someone who has an interest in studying the Bible is only the beginning. The purpose of the study is to help the person to become a genuine disciple of Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) What can help us to attain that goal?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Busy People: </span><span class="font1">People today are increasingly busy. In some places, few people may initially be willing to set aside a full hour to study the Bible. To help such ones, we have been encouraged to start and conduct Bible studies at the doorstep or over the telephone. At first, these studies may be relatively brief and may involve considering just a few Bible texts with the aid of one or two paragraphs in a publication, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font1"> book. How commendable it is that many publishers are now conducting such studies at the doorstep or over the telephone!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Should we be satisfied, though, to con tinue conducting a doorstep study indefinitely? No. Although we are wise not to overstay our welcome when a study is first started, the May 1990 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font1"> page 8, commented: “Once the study is established and the householder’s interest has developed, a longer period of time may be spent on the study.” This is vital. To illustrate: A starving child might initially be fed small amounts of food until his appetite is restored, but we would hardly expect him to regain his full strength and grow normally if he were fed such small portions for months on end. Similarly, a Bible student needs a more</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">2. What are doorstep and telephone Bible studies, and why are they effective?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Why should we endeavor to increase the period of time spent on a study at the door? formal and regular study in order to develop into a mature servant of God.—Heb. 5:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Bible Studies Inside the Home: </span><span class="font1">It is preferable to conduct a study in a private location—in a home or in some other suitable area. This will be more conducive to learning and will help the student to get the sense of God’s Word. (Matt. 13: 23) It will also better enable the teacher to tailor the study material to the needs of the student. Moreover, having a longer study period will allow for a more thorough, faith-strengthening consideration of God’s Word.—Rom. 10:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> How can you make the transition from a doorstep study to a study inside the home? After several brief studies, why not simply offer to study for a longer, specified period of time? Or you might use an indirect approach by asking the person, “Would you have time today to sit down and discuss this together?” or “How much time would you like to spend today discussing this subject?” If your efforts prove unsuccessful, by all means continue to have brief doorstep studies. At an appropriate time, try again to make the transition to inside the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> As we continue to search for deserving ones, let us not lose sight of our purpose in starting and conducting Bible studies. Our aim is to help honesthearted ones become dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah. May he bless our efforts as we carry out our ministry with this objective. —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Keep in Expectation of Jehovah</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah is a God of judgment,” wrote Isaiah. “Happy are all those keeping in expectation of him.” (Isa. 30:18b) There are many Bible accounts of God’s execution of judgment on his enemies and deliverance of his faithful servants. What lessons do such accounts teach worshippers of Jehovah today? What can we do now to prepare for “the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah”? (Joel 2:31, 32) Our upcoming “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention will move us to ponder those questions and make self-examination. It will help us to keep in expectation of Jehovah,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Have you made arrangements to benefit from all three days of the convention? For example, have you approached your employer about having time off to attend? Do not leave this to chance. Make it a matter of prayer. Then make your request. (Neh. 2:4, 5) Similarly, we should not put off finalizing arrangements for transportation, lodging, and oth er necessary matters. Such good planning reflects our deep appreciation for Jehovah’s spiritual table. Elders should be alert to help those who need assistance with their convention arrangements, especially the older ones in the congregation.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Fine Conduct Honors God: </span><span class="font1">When we gather in large numbers at conventions, our fine conduct serves as a witness to the community. What does this require of us? When we are at hotels, restaurants, and other places of business in the convention area, those we deal with should be refreshed by our Christian qualities, such as long-suffering, mildness, self-control, and reasonableness. (Gal. 5: 22, 23; Phil. 4:5) All of us should manifest the kind of love that “does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked,” Even if difficulties or inconveniences arise, we will want to “do all things for God’s glory.”—1 Cor. 10:31; 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font15">1. What is the convention theme, and why is it timely?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">2. How can we show appreciation for our district convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">3. What qualities should be in evidence among Jehovah’s people in the convention city?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">4. How can parents help their children to conduct themselves in a way that brings praise to Jehovah? </span><span class="font1">so impressed with the conduct and appearance of our youth that he expressed his desire “always to have Jehovah’s Witnesses as guests in his hotel.” What a cause for rejoicing! This is a credit to the training and supervision provided by you parents. It would be unwise for parents to allow their children to stay in a hotel room without supervision. Children should always be properly supervised. (Prov. 29:15) May their good conduct bring praise to Jehovah and make his heart rejoice! —Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Modest Dress and Grooming: </span><span class="font1">Each of us can contribute to the overall impression given at the convention by avoiding styles of dress and grooming that are faddish, extreme, immodest, or overly casual. This applies when traveling to and from the convention city, while helping to prepare the convention site, and while attending the sessions. As servants of God, our first concern is for Jehovah’s name and reputation, not our personal preferences or comfort. Family heads have the responsibility to make sure that their family’s appearance reflects modesty and soundness of mind at all times.—1 Tim. 2:9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> It is no less important to maintain a dignified appearance during leisure time at hotels, stores, and restaurants. It is appropriate to wear our convention attire if we eat out after the sessions. Wearing our convention badge card creates opportunities for us to witness informally.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Isaiah foretold: “Jehovah will keep in expectation of showing you favor, and therefore he will rise up to show you mercy.” (Isa. 30: 18a) Gratitude for Jehovah’s mercy and undeserved kindness should move us to honor him by our conduct and appearance as we gather together at our conventions. May the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention glorify our God and help us to keep in expectation of him!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Program Times: </span><span class="font8">The program will begin at 9:30 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. A few minutes before the start of the session, the chairman will be seated on the platform while introductory Kingdom music is played. All of us should take our seats at that time so that the program can begin in adignified manner. The program will conclude at 5:15 p.m. on Friday, at 5:05 p.m. on Saturday, and at 4:10 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Parking: </span><span class="font8">At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaceswill be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking areas reserved for the disabled. Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Seat Saving: </span><span class="font8">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Noon Meal: </span><span class="font8">Please bring a lunch rather than leaving the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers, glass containers, and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Donations: </span><span class="font8">Considerable expense is involved in arranging a district convention. We can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font8">Emergencyresponse services have complained that they receive many cell-phone calls over </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">mi</span><span class="font8">nor matters. If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified personnel on-site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If necessary, 911 will be called.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font8">The program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. An announcement regarding this will be made at the beginning of the first session. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small FM receiver along with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Recording: </span><span class="font8">Recorders of any type should not be connected to the facility’s sound system or electricity and may only be used in a way that does not disturb others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Picture Taking: </span><span class="font8">If you take pictures during the sessions, please do not use a flash.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pagers and Cell Phones: </span><span class="font8">These should be set so as not to cause a distraction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Fragrances: </span><span class="font8">Most conventions now take place in enclosed areas where we depend on mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be a kindness for us to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions to those who suffer from respiratory or other related problems.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Follow-Up Forms: </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font8"> (S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any who show interest as a result of our informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. The forms will also be available at the convention Book Room Department. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room for handling or to your congregation secretary upon your return.—See the February 2005 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> p. 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Restaurants: </span><span class="font8">In many places, it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hotels: </span><span class="font8">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font8">As Christians, surely we will not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff, especially during very busy check-in and checkout times.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO ADVERTISE THE “DELIVERANCE AT HAND!” DISTRICT CONVENTION</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Publishers in Each Congregation to Distribute Special Handbill</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">‘Starting in the spring of 2006 in the Northern Hemisphere and continuing until the series of district conventions throughout the world is over, a global campaign will be underway to advertise with a special handbill the district conventions that will be held in some 155 lands. This campaign will include the special conventions scheduled to take place in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland during July and the first week of August 2006.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> In view of the late hour in this time of the end, the conventions, highlighting God’s promised deliverance from this wicked system, should have a strong appeal to rightly disposed people. The message should prompt them to consider what lies ahead. In order to give tens of millions the opportunity to hear a message of comfort and hope, over 98,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide are being urged to share enthusiastically in advertising the convention to which they have been invited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Congregations will be consigned sufficient handbills to allow for each publisher to have up to 50 handbills. Any surplus can be utilized by the pioneers in the congregation. In each congregation, the campaign will begin three weeks prior to the opening date of the convention to which the congregation has been assigned. This should provide sufficient time to cover most, if not all, of the congregation’s territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> It is recommended that, wherever possible, a handbill be given personally to each householder. However, if some are not at home, a handbill can be left discreetly at the door. A diligent effort should be made to distribute all the handbills during the three-week period.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> We feel confident that a tremendous witness will be given as a result of this concerted global effort to advertise the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention as outlined herein. We pray that Jehovah’s rich blessing will be upon your personal efforts as you share in this worldwide campaign.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Ask for Referrals?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">If you are currently conducting a Bible study, why not ask the student if any of his friends, relatives, or acquaintances would also enjoy learning what the Bible teaches? Often several names are given. With the student’s permission, you could mention his name when you visit those individuals to offer a Bible study. You might say, “[Name of student] has enjoyed studying the Bible, and he thought that you too might like to benefit from our free Bible study program.” Then briefly demonstrate how the study is conducted, using the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font1"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you have a student who is making good progress, you might encourage him to describe the study arrangement to friends and family members who might be interested. He could invite them to sit in on his study. Or if that is not convenient, he could arrange for you to meet with them to demonstrate the study arrangement. Doing this would encourage the student to begin sharing his Bible knowledge with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those on whom you make regular return visits may also provide you with referrals, even if they themselves have not yet accepted a regular Bible study. When you offer them a copy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font1"> book, you could simply ask, “Do you know anyone else who would enjoy having a copy of this publication?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of the urgency of the times, we want to use every possible means to help people hear and accept the good news. Do you ask for referrals?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">■ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2006 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. If the congregation needs additional badge cards, these should be requested on the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Request Form</span><span class="font15"> (S-14).

Before sending regular pioneer application forms to the branch, make sure they are completely filled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">■ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and promptly forward a </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Presiding Overseer/Secretary Change of Address</span><span class="font15"> (S-29) form to the branch office.

<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">'As true Christians, we have accepted the invitation to be “fishers of men.” (Matt. 4:19) Like literal fishermen, we will likely have better results in the work of fishing for men if we schedule time to preach when people can be found. In many lands, the coming months will bring additional daylight hours. In the late afternoon and early evening, more people are at home. Often, they are in a relaxed frame of mind and may be more inclined to receive visitors. Can you adapt your schedule to preach at those times?—1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Evening Witnessing: </span><span class="font1">Planning ahead to preach during the evening hours may enable us to reach more people with the good news. (Prov. 21:5) Youths may be able to preach after school. Others may be able to do so after work. Some book study groups could arrange to preach for an hour before the weekly study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Preaching from house to house during the late afternoon and early evening hours may result in talking to those who normally are not at home. In many territories, street work and other forms of public witnessing can also be done in the evening. And many find evenings</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">1. Why should we adapt our schedule for preaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">2. What are some ways we can reach more people with the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">3. In what ways can you preach during the late afternoon and early evening hours in your territory? </span><span class="font1">to be the best time to make return visits and start Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Discernment Needed: </span><span class="font1">Good judgment is needed when engaging in evening witnessing. Usually, it is best to limit witnessing to the early evening hours, rather than calling when householders may be getting ready to retire for the night. (Phil. 4:5) When you knock at the door, stand where you can be seen, and clearly identify yourself. Quickly make known the purpose of your visit. If you call at an inopportune time, such as when a family is eating, offer to call at another time. Always be considerate. —Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> We also need to be aware of potential dangers. If you are witnessing at dusk or after dark, it is wise to travel in pairs or groups. Stay on well-lit streets where you are not isolated. Witness only in places where you feel safe. Avoid areas that may not be safe after dark.—Prov. 22:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> Witnessing during the late afternoon and early evening may allow us to work in service with the auxiliary and regular pioneers. (Rom. 1:12) Can you adapt your schedule to share in this feature of service?</span></p>

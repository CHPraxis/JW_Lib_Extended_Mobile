<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Lose the Love You Had at First</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">’The glorified Jesus counseled the first-century congregation in Ephesus: “I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.” (Rev. 2:4) Evidently, many had lost their first love for Jehovah. When we were learning the truth, we developed a strong love for God and neighbor, and this moved us to share our newfound hope with zeal. What will prevent us from losing the love we had at first and from slowing down in the ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Personal Study and Meeting Attendance: </span><span class="font14">What caused us to develop love for God and neighbor when we first learned the truth? Was it not all that we learned about Jehovah from our study of the Scriptures? (1 John 4:16, 19) Therefore, so that our love “may abound yet more and more,” we must continue taking in accurate knowledge, digging into “the deep things of God.”—Phil. 1:9-11;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">1 Cor. 2:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Maintaining a good routine of personal study can be a real challenge in these last days filled with many anxieties and distractions. (2 Tim. 3:1) We must set aside time in our schedule to take in spiritual food. Attending congregation meetings regularly is also vital, especially as we “behold the day drawing near.”—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> The Ministry: </span><span class="font14">Zealous participation in the ministry helps us to keep our first love for God. As we preach the good news, we remind ourselves of Jehovah’s loving promises, and this helps us to keep our hope bright and our love alive. Teaching Bible truths requires that we do research to understand them clearly ourselves, and this strengthens our faith.—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah is deserving of all things, including our love. (Rev. 4:11) Do not allow yours to fade. Keep your first love strong by earnest personal Bible study, regular meeting attendance, and zealously declaring to others what is most dear to your heart.—Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Call Back on All Who Show a Measure of Interest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Many of us are in the truth today because someone took note of our favorable response to the Kingdom message and patiently returned—perhaps a number of times—to cultivate that interest. We likewise should conscientiously call back on all who show a measure of interest. Really, making return visits is Included in our commission to “make disciples.”—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Discern interest: </span><span class="font14">Even if an individual does not accept literature, his facial expression, tone of voice, or choice of words may reveal a measure of appreciation for the Kingdom message. On that basis we may make a return visit. One brother made calls on an individual for five consecutive weeks without placing literature. On the sixth visit, the person accepted literature, and eventually a Bible study was started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If you detect interest, return promptly, perhaps a few days later. Do not give “the wicked one” opportunity to snatch away what has been sown in the person’s heart. (Matt, 13:19) Be sure to keep your word if you made arrangements to go back at a specific time.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> In Street Work: </span><span class="font14">Do you endeavor to follow up on the interest you find while in street work or when witnessing informally? At the end of your conversation, you could say: “I enjoyed our discussion. Where can I reach you so that we can talk again?” When appropriate, some publishers may choose to give the interested person their phone number or ask to exchange phone numbers. If people see you in street work at the same location on a regular basis, they may not be reluctant to give you their phone number or address. Even if they refuse to give you contact information, you can still try to further their interest the next time you meet them on the street.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> When we see plants that we have watered and cultivated flourish, it brings us joy. Similarly, we can receive much joy by making return visits and helping individuals to progress spiritually. (1 Cor. 3:6) Make it your aim to call back on all who show a measure of interest.</span></p>

Have them relate the effects of the school on their ministry and on their spirituality.

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Moses provided direction for all Israelites and alien residents to assemble together every seven years to have the Law read to them. For what purpose? “In order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (Deut. 31:10-12) Jehovah saw the need for assembling his people in large groups. Soon Jehovah’s people will again be assembling for the three-day “Follow the Christ!” District Conventions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Have you started making preparations? Do you need to request time off from your employer? Can you help your Bible students or unbelieving family members to attend the convention with you? Are there others in the congregation who need assistance to attend? Are you planning to attend a convention different from the one to which your congregation is assigned? Will you need a hotel room? The following information will help you to prepare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Attend All Three Days: </span><span class="font0">Jehovah provides an abundance of spiritual food for his people. (Isa. 25:6) This includes the spiritual banquet served at our annual conventions. It has been observed that the Friday attendance is considerably</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">3. (a) What fulfillment of Isaiah 25:6 is occurring today? (b) What has been observed regarding the Friday convention attendance, and what should we personally do? </span><span class="font0">lower than that on other days. Make it your goal to enjoy all three of the refreshing convention days that Jehovah’s organization has prepared for us! If you need to request time off from your secular employment, make it a matter of prayer. Then ‘muster up boldness’ to talk with your employer as soon as the date of your convention is announced. (1 Thess. 2:2; Neh. 2:4, 5) It may prove helpful to explain to him that your annual convention is part of your worship. Doing this at an early date may make it easier for your employer to make adjustments so as to accommodate your request.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation:</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. Call hotels during regular business hours, using the telephone numbers on the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. Inform the hotel that you are attending the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. Specify the dates you will check in and check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">4. If no more rooms are available, call another hotel on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">5.</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"> Do not</span><span class="font14"> accept a higher rate than what is shown on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">6. Make your reservation, and ask for a confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">7. Make your deposit by credit card, check, or money order </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">within ten days. Never </span><span class="font14">send cash. If a deposit is made by check or money order, write the confirmation number on the front.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Guidelines to Follow:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">■ Stay only in hotels on the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ Do not call hotels that are not on the list and ask if they have a rate for our convention. Call ONLY hotels on the recommended fist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Hotels are not to begin taking reservations for our conventions before the Service Meeting during the week of January 1, 2007. Do not call for convention reservations prior to this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Accept only the room rates shown on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Each room reserved should be in the name of the person who will actually occupy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Use the reservation phone numbers on the list. Do not make your hotel reservation online unless the list indicates this should be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ To comply with fire regulations, do not exceed the number of adults allowed in the hotel room, as shown on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Do not inform your congregation secretary that there are no more rooms available unless you have called ALL the hotels on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Keep your first reservation.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ If you must cancel a reservation, do so as early as possible. Be sure to receive a cancellation number.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Assisting Your Brothers and Sisters: </span><span class="font0">The apostle Paul advised those Christians who were rich in a material way “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share.” (1 Tim. 6:17, 18) We can show the generous spirit that Paul espoused if we consider the situation of the elderly and infirm, those in full-time service, single-parent families, and perhaps others in the congregation who may need assistance to attend the convention. Filling the needs of such ones falls first on relatives in the truth, but the elders and others can show discernment and offer kind assistance as needed—Gal. 6:10; 1 Tim. 5:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> If someone in the congregation needs help in obtaining accommodations, the Congregation Service Committee should decide if the publisher qualifies to submit a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Needs Room Request.</span><span class="font0"> Before submitting this to the convention’s Rooming Department, the guidelines found on the form and in the December 14, 2006, letter addressed to all bodies of elders should be consulted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font0">The March 1, 2007, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> will contain a list of all the conventions in the United States and Canada. If you need the Recommended Lodging List or any additional information for a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned, you may write the particular convention, using the address that the congregation secretary will find on the back of the current </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Needs Room Request </span><span class="font0">form. So that the convention headquarters can reply to you, be sure to include a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your letter.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">5, 6. (a) How can we demonstrate the generous spirit referred to at 1 Timothy 6:18? (b) What provision is made for helping some who may need assistance in obtaining accommodations?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">7. What guidelines are provided if we need to attend a convention other than the one to which our congregation is assigned?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Reserving a Hotel Room: </span><span class="font0">A Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on the congregation information board at the conclusion of your Service Meeting for the week of January 1. Follow the instructions in the box '‘Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation.” If no rooms are available after you have called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font0"> the hotels on the list or if you have a problem with a particular hotel, inform your congregation secretary. He should contact the convention Rooming Department, using the information at the top of the list. Do not call the branch office. If the hotels listed are not accepting additional requests, please wait for the congregation to receive a revised list for your convention rather than calling a hotel not on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Cooperate With the Arrangements: </span><span class="font0">When we walk onto the convention site, it is evident that much work has gone into preparing for our arrival.

Vital work has also been accomplished behind the scenes to prepare program parts, negotiate with hotels, and care for numerous details.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> For each convention, many individuals have been working for months to make the needed arrangements, and their families have also contributed by allowing them the time to care for such important matters. Do we not appreciate the sacrifices that have been made for our personal benefit? We can show our gratitude by complying with the instructions in this article and with any further direction we may receive prior to our convention. (Heb. 13:17) The willing cooperation of everyone makes it possible for all things to “take place decently and by arrangement.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> As we “behold the day drawing near,” gatherings of God’s people are all the more important. (Heb. 10:25) At our Christian conventions, the faithful and discreet slave class provides information to help us “take care to carry out all the words” that Jehovah wants us to follow. (Deut. 31:12) Start making plans now to attend all three days of the “Follow the Christ!” District Convention and thereby benefit from all the spiritual instruction and delightful fellowship!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Question box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">■ Would it be appropriate to arrange yard sales or other fund-raising events to help the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is common for religious organizations to sponsor fundraisingevents, such as dinners, sales, or festivals. While some may feel that these are for a good cause, the events amount to forms of solicitation. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not obtain financial support in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The second issue of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font14"> August 1879, said this about our refusal to imitate the churches and solicit funds: “‘Zion’s Watch Tower’ has, we believe JEHOVAH for its backer, and while this is the case it will never </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">beg </span><span class="font14">nor </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">petition</span><span class="font14"> men for support. When He who says: ‘All the gold and silver of the mountains are mine,’ falls to provide necessary funds, we will understand it to be time to suspend the publication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We continue to follow the Scriptural principle: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7) Contribution boxes are kept in the Kingdom Hall so that individuals can make voluntary donations if they wish. (2 Ki. 12:9) Contributions are not solicited; neither are they given with the idea of obtaining something in return.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> When Goliath taunted the battle lines of Israel, any of the soldiers could have fought him. But it was a shepherd boy, untrained in warfare, who volunteered. (1 Sam. 17:32) When the exiled Jews went back to Jerusalem but failed to rebuild the walls, it was a cupbearer to the king of Persia who volunteered to leave his privileged position in the palace and to travel to Jerusalem in order to organize the work. (Neh. 2:5) Jehovah blessed both of these men, David and Nehemiah, for the spirit they showed.—1 Sam. 17:45,. 50; Neh. 6:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Today, the volunteer spirit is lacking in the world. In these ‘‘last days,” people lead very busy lives, and many are “lovers of themselves.” (2 Tim. 3: 1, 2) It is easy for a person to become so absorbed in personal interests that he overlooks opportunities to volunteer his services when there is a need to help others. However, as Christians, we desire to imitate Jesus, who took the initiative to help others. (John 5:5-9; 13:12-15; 1 Pet. 2:21) How can we demonstrate a volunteer spirit, and what blessings will we receive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> In Behalf of Our Brothers: </span><span class="font14">We can impart a “spiritual gift” to others by volunteering to comment when meeting parts call for audience participation. (Rom. 1:11) Commenting honors Jehovah, impress-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">1. How did David and Nehemiah demonstrate a volunteer spirit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. Why should Christians demonstrate a volunteer spirit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. How does the volunteer spirit contribute to congregation meetings? es the truth more firmly on our mind and heart, and adds to our enjoyment of the meetings. (Ps. 26:12) We can also volunteer to give a talk in the Theocratic Ministry School when a substitute is needed. This will help us to improve our teaching ability.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">‘Brothers can demonstrate the volunteer spirit by reaching out to care for responsibilities in the congregation. (Isa. 32:2; 1 Tim. 3:1) All can help to keep assemblies and conventions running smoothly by volunteering to work in the various departments. When we volunteer to work with the traveling overseer in the ministry or to provide a meal for him, this results in “an interchange of encouragement.” (Rom. 1:12) When we offer to provide practical assistance to fatherless boys, widows, the sick and infirm, mothers with young children, and others in the congregation, we experience joy and Jehovah’s favor.—Prov. 19:17; Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Another way for us to volunteer our time and effort is to assist in cleaning and maintaining the Kingdom Hall. In addition, because many people are coming into the truth, there is a growing need for new Kingdom Halls and volunteers to build them. One couple made themselves available to assist the local Regional Building Committee even though the couple were un-</span></p>

Over time, the couple were given training and now assist in laying bricks. The wife remarked: “Working side by side with others has resulted in very close friendships. At the end of the day, we are physically tired but spiritually refreshed.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> By Preaching: </span><span class="font14">The most important volunteer work that we can perform today is the Kingdom-preaching work. As people are helped to understand and apply the Bible’s counsel, they gain a purpose in life and the strength to overcome harmful habits. They learn the Bible’s uplifting hope for the future. By providing Bible education, we perform a joyful volunteer service with long-lasting benefits. (John 17:3; 1 Tim. 4:16) Perhaps our circumstances might allow us to have a greater share in this work by auxiliary or regular pioneering, by moving to where the need is greater, or by learning another language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> King David prophesied that at the time the Messiah would begin his rulership, God’s people would “offer themselves willingly.” (Ps. 110:3, ftn.) With Jehovah speeding up the final spiritual harvest, there is much work for which to volunteer. (Isa. 60: 22) Have you said: “Here I am! Send me”? (Isa. 6:8) Truly, by our demonstrating the volunteer spirit, we please Jehovah and reap rich rewards.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> A personal territory is one that is assigned to you. It may be conveniently located so that you can reach it Quickly and preach either alone or with another publisher. While it is beneficial to support congregation arrangements for group witnessing when possible, having a personal territory to work on other occasions can help in giving a thorough witness, especially in congregations that have a large amount of territory.—Acts 10:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Benefits: </span><span class="font14">Some have found additional benefits preaching in a personal territory near their workplace during their lunch break or immediately after work. Others have enjoyed working together as a family in their neighborhood for an hour or so before the Congregation Book Study. As a result, the return visits and Bible studies obtained were in a nearby area, resulting in an economy of effort, time, and expense. Because more can be accomplished in less time, having a personal territory may help some to auxiliary pioneer from time to time or even to enroll as regular pioneers. In addition, working a personal territory and becoming familiar with the householders can assist us in gaining their trust and tailoring our presentation to their concerns, making our ministry more effective.</span></p></li>

What was the experience of one pioneer who obtained a personal territory? seer to obtain a personal territory relates: “I accepted this advice and soon became well acquainted and friendly with the householders in my territory. I adjusted the times of my visits according to their convenience. As a result, my return visits rose from 35 to over 80 a month, and I have seven home Bible studies.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How to Do It: </span><span class="font14">If you want to request a personal territory, speak to the territory servant. Feel free to invite another publisher to work along with you, and keep a record of the not-at-homes. You should try to complete the territory within four months. If you have difficulty doing so, you may ask your Congregation Book Study overseer or others for assistance. At the end of four months, you can either return the completed territory or ask to work it again. However, you should not keep the same territory indefinitely but return it so that others may request it. If you are in a congregation where territory is limited and it is not possible to obtain a personal territory, perhaps you can request a portion of a territory from your book study overseer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Our commission to preach “in all the inhabited earth” is a daunting assignment. (Matt. 24:14) It requires good coordination of effort.

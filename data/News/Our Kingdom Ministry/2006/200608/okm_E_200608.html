<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Featured in September</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Almost everyone appreciates the sound of songbirds and the sight of a sunset. Many, however, fail to acknowledge that a loving heavenly Father created these things. We will have a unique opportunity to testify in behalf of Jehovah’s creatorship by distributing a special issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> (Isa. 40:28; 43:10) The September issue is devoted entirely to the subject “Is There a Creator?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In the Territory: </span><span class="font9">If possible, arrange to share in the house-to-house ministry with the congregation each Saturday. Of course, feel free to offer the special issue at other times during the week. Teachers and others who work in the held of education should be particularly interested in this issue. Therefore, special arrangements may be made to visit such ones who are in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If Interest is shown, leave the person with a question that you will answer on the next visit. For example, you could raise a question about why a loving Creator would allow so much suffering. Then, on the return visit, you could feature chapter 1 or chapter 11 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book. Or you may choose to raise a question about the Creator’s purpose for the earth and then to consider chapter 3 when you return.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup>At School: </span><span class="font9">If you are in school, why not present the special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> as a gift to your teachers and fellow students? Just putting a copy on your desk may prompt questions about our beliefs. You will likely have opportunities to use information from it when defending your faith in classroom discussions and when preparing reports. To assist you, this issue contains a “Young People Ask” article entitled “How Can I Defend My Belief in Creation?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah deserves honor and glory for what he has created. (Rev. 4:11) We can honor our Creator and help others to do so by enthusiastically offering the September issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest —By Preaching Impartially</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In a vision, the apostle John saw an angel flying in midheaven declaring everlasting good news to people of “every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” (Rev. 14:6) Do we follow the angel’s lead by preaching impartially? Without realizing it, we could have views that are biased or prejudiced. Our attitude toward people we meet can affect the way we present the good news to them. Therefore, we need to demonstrate genuine loving concern when preaching to people of a different background.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Consider Your Territory: </span><span class="font9">Are there immigrants or refugees living in your territory? They could easily be overlooked. Take the initiative to search out these ones and try to get to know them better. What are their needs and concerns, their likes and dislikes, their fears and prejudices? Endeavor to adapt your presentation of the Kingdom message accordingly. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Like the apostle Paul, we should feel an obligation to share the good news with everyone in our territory, including those who are from a foreign country, those who have a different culture, those who speak another language, and those who are very wealthy.—Rom. 1:14, ftn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> How, though, can you witness to someone who speaks another language? Make good use of the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Good News for People of All Nations.</span><span class="font9"> You might also carry some tracts or brochures in the languages that are commonly spoken in your territory. (See the July 2003 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> p. 4, pars. 2-3.) In addition, some publishers have put forth the effort to learn a greeting and a simple presentation in other languages. People are often impressed to hear someone trying to speak to them in their own language, even in a very limited way, and this may attract them to the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Imitate Jehovah: </span><span class="font9">By reaching out to people of different backgrounds, we imitate our impartial God, Jehovah, “whose will is that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all sorts of men </span><span class="font9">should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” •- 1 Tim. 2:3, 4.</span></p>

What blessings result from auxiliary pioneering? If you have the desire but are unsure, why should you make it a matter of prayer? (Acts 4:29; 2 Cor. 4:7; Jas. 1:5) Why is it also good to discuss this with your family and others in the congregation, especially with those who have similar circumstances? (Prov. 15:22) When are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font9"> planning to auxiliary pioneer?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">The world would have us believe that the present system of things will last forever. However, God’s Word tells us differently. (1 John 2:15-17) It helps us to appreciate that ‘storing up treasures upon the earth’ is a vain pursuit. To fortify God’s people, the circuit assembly program for the 2007 service year will develop the theme “Store Up... Treasures in Heaven.”—Matt. 6:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Materialistic thinking is included in what is referred to at Ephesians 2:2 as “the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.” Just as the literal air is everywhere, ready to be breathed in, so “the spirit of the world” permeates this system. (1 Cor. 2:12) Since its influence is</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Empowered by holy spirit, the early Christians exercised the greatest vigor in giving the good news the widest possible proclamation. (Acts 1:8; Col. 1: 23) The special assembly day program for the 2007 service year, “Be Intensely Occupied With the Word,” will help us to imitate their excellent example. —Acts 18:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Commenting on God’s word, King David said: “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.” (Ps. 19:7) The carefully prepared program for the 2007 special assembly day will highlight the value of the Scriptures “for setting things straight” and will encourage us to use God’s Word to preach and to teach with a sense of urgency. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) The new program will show how we can avoid pitfalls and benefit ourvery potent, it is said to have “authority.” The new circuit assembly program will help us to avoid the world’s materialistic thinking and to keep sharply in focus our priorities. (Matt. 6: 33) In addition, the program will help us to rely on Jehovah as we carry out our ministry despite the pressures and trials we may face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Make sure that you are present for both days and that you “pay more than the usual attention.” (Heb. 2:1) Take brief notes on points that you can apply personally in your life and in your ministry. By being present from the very beginning to the very end of this spiritually enriching program, you will be encouraged and strengthened to continue ‘storing up treasures in heaven’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">selves by applying Bible principles in daily life. It will also help us to use God’s Word to assist youths and new ones to make spiritual progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">—Our Primary Bible Study Aid</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How thrilling it was to witness the release of the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font13"> at the “Godly Obedience” District Convention! Delegates rejoiced to receive a personal copy at the close of the Saturday program. How will this new teaching tool be utilized? It is designed to be our primary Bible study aid. Although the new book will first be featured as the literature offer in March, publishers are encouraged to begin using it immediately to start and conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Current Bible Studies: </span><span class="font13">Publishers conducting Bible studies in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure should use good judgment in deciding how and when to begin using the new publication during the study. If a study was started recently, you could simply start from the beginning of the new book. If you are further along in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book, you might continue the study in the corresponding chapter of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book. If you are toward the end of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book, you may decide to complete that publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> No doubt all of us know many people who would benefit from studying the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font13">book. Why not offer each person a Bible study in this progressive study aid? For example, those who have studied the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure or the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book but who did not progress to dedication and baptism may wish to resume their study using the new book. Parents may decide to use the publication as they impart accurate knowledge of God’s will to their children—Col. 1:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Studying a Second Book: </span><span class="font13">Is there a provision for a Bible student to study a second book after completing </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font13"> Yes. If it is evident that a student is making progress, although slowly, and is developing appreciation for what he is learning, the Bible study may be continued using the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God.</span><span class="font13"> We are confident that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book will be a powerful tool in our hands as we carry out the commission to make disciples.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest—By Asking Questionsand Listening</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Most people enjoy expressing their views but dislike being lectured or interrogated. As Christian ministers, therefore, we need to learn the art of drawing people out with questions. —Prov. 20:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Our questions should invite, not intimidate. When preaching from house to house, one brother asks, “Do you feel that there will ever be a time when people treat one another with dignity and respect?” Depending on the response, he follows with, “What do you think it will take to accomplish this?” or “Why do you feel that way?” When witnessing informally and in public places, another brother asks those who have children, “What do you enjoy most about being a parent?” Then he asks, “What are your greatest concerns?” Notice that these questions allow people to express their views without putting them on the spot. Since circumstances vary, we may need to adjust the topic and tone of our questions to fit those in our territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Drawing People Out: </span><span class="font13">If people are willing to share their thoughts, patiently listen without needlessly interrupting. (Jas. 1:19) Graciously acknowledge their comments. (Col. 4:6) You might simply say: “That’s interesting. Thank you for sharing that with me.” Commend them if you can do so sincerely. Kindly ask additional questions to find out what they think and why they feel as they do. Seek common ground. When you want to direct their attention to a scripture, you might say, “Have you ever considered this as a possibility?” Avoid being dogmatic or argumentative. —2 Tim. 2:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> How others respond to our questions may depend much on how we listen. People can tell if we are listening with our heart. A traveling overseer observed, “When you show patient willingness to listen to people, it has the amazing power to attract and is a wonderful expression of warm personal interest.&quot; Listening to others accords them honor, and it may move them to listen to the good news that we seek to share.—Rom. 12:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Many of us would be delighted to conduct a Bible study if only we could get the study started. The new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font14"> can help us. The preface on pages 3-7 is designed to get the householder into a Bible discussion using the publication. Even those with limited experience in the ministry will And it easy to use to start studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">■ You might try this approach using page 3:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">After mentioning a news item or a problem that is on the minds of people in your territory, direct the householder’s attention to the questions in bold type on page 3, and invite him to comment. Then turn to pages 4-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">■ Or you might prefer to start by highlighting pages 4-5:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">You could say, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the changes pictured here actually took place?” Or you might ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Listen carefully to the response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If the householder shows a special interest in one of the scriptures, show him what the Bible teaches on that subject by considering the paragraphs in the book that discuss that text. (See box on this page of insert.) Consider the material just as you would on a Bible study. This can be done in five to ten minutes on the initial call right at the doorstep.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">■ Another approach is to draw the person out using page 6:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Direct the householder’s attention to the questions at the bottom of the page, and ask, “Have you ever wondered about any of these questions?” If he expresses interest in one of the questions, turn to the paragraphs in the book that answer the question. (See box on this page of insert.) As you consider the information together, you are conducting a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">■ Page 7 may be used to lead into a demonstration of a Bible study:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Read the first three sentences on the page, and then turn to chapter 3 and demonstrate a study using paragraphs 1-3. Arrange to return to discuss the answers to the questions in paragraph 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">■ How to arrange to return:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">When concluding the initial study, arrange to continue the discussion. You might simply say: “In just a few minutes, we learned what the Bible teaches on an important subject. Next time, we can discuss [leave a question that will be considered]. May I stop by at this same time next week?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As we draw closer to Jehovah’s appointed time, he continues to equip us for the task at hand. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 2 Tim. 3:17) Let us make good use of this marvelous new tool to start Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■ Since April has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “You Can Enjoy Life in Peace Now —And Forever!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 12, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font12"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>

This includes all letters and items of literature that are mailed to give a witness to interested people, to not-at-homes, or to those who live in inaccessible places.

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Young People Who Are Shining as Illuminators</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus told his disciples: “You are the light of the world. ” (Matt. 5:14, 16) Like a city situated on a hilltop, gleaming In the sunlight, they would stand out. Today, many young Christians are “shining as illuminators in the world&quot; by their upright conduct and zealous witnessing.—Phil. 2:15; Mal. 3:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> At School: </span><span class="font13">How might you give a witness at school? Some youths have taken advantage of class discussions on such subjects as drugs, evolution, and the Holocaust—to name just a few. One sister used an assigned essay on terrorism to give a witness about God's Kingdom as the real hope for mankind. The teacher was impressed by the well-thought-out report, and this opened the way for a further witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Another way to shine as an illuminator is by your conduct and modest dress and grooming. (1 Cor. 4:9; 1 Tim. 2:9) When students and teachers see that your deportment is different, some may be drawn to the truth as a result of your fine conduct and give you an opportunity to share Bible truths. (1 Pet. 2:12; 3: 1, 2) Displaying godly conduct may not be easy, but Jehovah will bless you richly. (1 Pet. 3:16, 17; 4:14) To arouse interest in the good news, you may read Bible literature during breaks or leave it where others can see it.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1 . How does the Bible indicate that Christians would stand out, and how do those words apply to Christian youths today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2 . What are some ways you can witness to teachers and classmates?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3 . How can you let your light shine at school through your conduct?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Letting your light shine at school strengthens your faith and helps you build a wholesome pride in serving Jehovah. (Jer. 9:24) It likewise serves as a protection. One sister said, “One benefit of speaking about my beliefs is that students do not try to pressure me into doing things that are not in harmony with what the Bible says.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Expanded Service: </span><span class="font13">Another way in which many youths are shining as illuminators is by expanding their ministry. After finishing high school, one brother moved to serve where there was a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers. He was part of a small congregation with only one elder. “I am having the time of my life here,” he wrote to a friend. “The ministry is so refreshing! We talk for about 20 minutes at each door because people want to hear all you can tell them.” He added: “I just wish that every young person would do something like this and feel what I feel. There Is nothing better than to serve Jehovah with all we have.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> How proud we are of you young people who are shining as illuminators in the world! (1 Thess. 2:20) As you serve Jehovah with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength, you will reap “a hundredfold now in this period of time ... and in the coming system of things everlasting life.”—Mark 10:29, 30; 12:30.</span></p></li></ul>

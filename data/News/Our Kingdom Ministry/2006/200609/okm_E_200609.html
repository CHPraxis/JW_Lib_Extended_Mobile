<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">September 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 9/06 Vol. 49, No. 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Q)e/i/' ffimcffiorn ^£ablbiher&amp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Let the Will of Jehovah Take Place.” (Acts 21:14) This was the title of a symposium presented to the United States Bethel family by Governing Body and Branch Committee members on the evening of Monday, December 26, 2005. It was explained that as a result of the simplification of certain branch operations, some Bethel family members would be invited to serve in the United States field in various assignments where the excellent training they have received at Bethel could be put to good use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Improved technology has made our shipping and printing facilities more efficient. This has reduced the need for volunteers in the Bethel home. On the other hand, there is a growing need for more “workers [in the] harvest.” (Luke 10:2) As one member of the Governing Body observed: “We can buy machines to do our printing for us, but machines cannot preach the good news.” Therefore, mature, experienced brothers and sisters who have benefited from Bethel training are being assigned to the field where they will be able to contribute much to the preaching and disciple-making work. A number of congregations in the United States branch territory will benefit from their help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are confident that Jehovah will richly bless the adjustments being made to balance the need for faithful workers at Bethel with the needs in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your brothers,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaign October 16-November 12!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “The End of False Religion Is Near!” That is the title of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> No. 37, which will be distributed around the world beginning next month. During the first half of October, we will offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines. Starting Monday, October 16, through Sunday, November 12, we will engage in an intensive distribution of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font12">No. 37. On weekends during the campaign, we will offer it along with the current magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Who Can Share: </span><span class="font12">All who are actively publishing the good news will want to have a full share. Some will be able to auxiliary pioneer. Do you have children or Bible students who are making spiritual progress? Help them to approach the elders to see if they qualify as unbaptized publishers. Elders should take the initiative to speak with inactive publishers in order to encourage them to participate, perhaps, by working along with experienced publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> A supply of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font12">No, 37 is being sent to all congregations so that publishers and pioneers can obtain at least 50 copies. Interested ones who are not yet publishers may receive five copies to distribute to family members and friends. All should keep track of the number they place and note this on the back of their field service reports at the end of October and November. The secretary will tabulate the total for the congregation and report it to the branch office at the end of each month. Any copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> that are remaining after the campaign concludes may be used in any feature of the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What to Say: </span><span class="font12">Keep your presentation brief, as this will allow for a wider distribution of the message. You could say: “As a public service, I am sharing in an earth-wide distribution of this important message. This is your free copy. Please read it,” It may be advantageous not to carry a witnessing case to the doors. Be sure to keep a record of the interest found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How to Cover Your Territory: </span><span class="font12">Rather than distributing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> in street work, focus on covering as much of your house-to-house and business territory as possible. Keep track of not-at-homes, and try to return at a different time or day of the week. Beginning Monday, November 6, a copy may be left at not-at-homes. However, if the congregation has more territory than can be covered during the allotted time, the elders may determine that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font12"> should be left at not-at-homes during the entire campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The destruction of “Babylon the Great” is fast approaching. People need to get out of her before she is completely destroyed. (Rev. 14:8; 18:8) Make plans now to have a full share in this worldwide campaign to let all know that the end of false religion is near!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Is it appropriate to compile material that will be featured in the Theocratic Ministry School and distribute it to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is permissible to do this for the personal use of family members and a few close friends. However, such material should not be made available for general distribution or be provided in exchange for money, as this would be a violation of copyright laws.—Rom. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For certain assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School, only a theme is provided; no references are indicated as source material. Would it be beneficial for someone to work up a list of references or to compile source material that could be used by those who receive such assignments? No. Neither would it be proper to compile the answers to the questions in the Theocratic Ministry School Review for use by others, as this would not help them to fix important points in mind. Students should do their own research. This is an important aspect of the training that Jehovah provides by means of the school to help us speak with “the tongue of the taught ones.”—Isa. 50:4.</span></p>

Three and a half years later, in 33 C.E., he came to Jerusalem’s temple and threw out those who were making it a cave of robbers. There appears to be a parallel to this in the three-and-a-half-year period from Jesus' enthronement in the heavens in October 1914 until his coming to inspect professed Christians as judgment began with the house of God. (Matthew 21:12, 13; 1 Peter 4:17) Early in 1918 the Kingdom activity of Jehovah’s people met with great opposition. It was a time of testing earth wide, and fearful ones were sifted out. In May 1918 Christendom’s clergy instigated the imprisonment of officials of the Watch Tower Society, but nine months later these were released. Later, the false charges against them were dropped. From 1919 the organization of God’s people, tried and refined, moved zealously forward to proclaim Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus as the hope for mankind.—Malachi 3:1-3.</span></p>

It is because his kingship is established in the face of bitter opposition from Jehovah’s chief adversary, Satan the Devil, and those on earth who—knowingly or unknowingly—serve Satan’s ends. The birth of the Kingdom itself calls for a major war in heaven. Fighting under the name Michael (meaning “Who Is Like God?”), Jesus overcomes Satan and his demons and hurls them down to the earth. (Revelation 12:7-12) Jesus’ ride of conquest continues through the opening decades of the Lord’s day while sheeplike humans are being gathered. Though the whole world still lies “in the power of the wicked one,” Jesus lovingly continues to shepherd his anointed brothers and their companions, helping each to achieve the conquest of faith.— 1 John 5:19.</span></p>

And today there is the frightful incidence of heart disease and cancer, much of which is caused by tobacco pollution. In what was described as “the ugly decade&quot; of the 1980’s, a way of life that is lawless by Bible standards added the scourge of AIDS to the “deadly plague.” In the year 2000, the U.S. surgeon general was reported as calling AIDS “probably the worst health epidemic the world has ever known.” He said that 52 million people around the world had contracted HIV/AIDS, and of them 20 million had died. How thankful Jehovah’s people are that the wise counsel of his Word keeps them away from fornication and misuse of blood, through which so many diseases are transmitted today!—Acts 15: 28, 29; compare 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.</span></p>

Since Bible prophecies are often completely understood only after they are fulfilled or in the course of fulfillment, we will have to wait and see.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Those experienced in the various ways of spreading the Truth will agree that the house to house canvass with MILLENNIAL DAWN is, in the present time, by far the most effective way of preaching the Truth.” That statement from the July 1, 1893, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Zion’s Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> highlighted the value of the house-to-house ministry. People earth wide have come to view it as a trademark of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Is this method still of value, since it is increasingly difficult to find people at home in some lands?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Scriptural and Important: </span><span class="font12">House-to-house witnessing has a Scriptural basis. Jesus instructed 70 disciples to go by twos to the houses of the people. (Luke 10:5-7) Shortly after Jesus’ death, the Bible says of his disciples: “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.” (Acts 5:42) The apostle Paul also zealously taught from house to house.—Acts 20:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Witnessing from house to house continues to be an important method of spreading the good news today. It enables us to “search out” deserving ones in a systematic and orderly way. (Matt. 10:11) People are generally more relaxed at home. Speaking with them face-to-face—hearing their voice, seeing their facial expressions, and observing their surroundings—allows us to discern their interests and concerns. It usually gives us the best opportunity to engage in extended conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Make Personal Adjustments: </span><span class="font12">The apostle Paul was willing to make personal adjustments “for the sake of the good news.” (1 Cor. 9:23) Perhaps we can adjust our schedule to preach when more people are likely to be at home, such as later in the day, on weekends, or on holidays. Keep a record of notat-homes, and try again on a different day of the week or at a different time of the day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Even those with health limitations may be able to share in preaching from house to house. Perhaps we can make it a point to take such ones with us to homes that are easily accessible, allowing them to work at a comfortable pace. One sister’s shortness of breath allowed her to call at only one house every half hour. Yet, how happy and satisfied she felt after being included in the group!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Many sheeplike ones continue to be found in the door-to-door work. One publisher knocked on a door and was told: “Come in. I know who you are. I have been praying for God to send someone to help me, and then I heard the knock at the door. He heard me and sent you.&quot; The results give evidence that Jehovah is blessing this method of preaching. (Matt. 11:19) Be determined to make house-to-house witnessing a regular feature of your ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

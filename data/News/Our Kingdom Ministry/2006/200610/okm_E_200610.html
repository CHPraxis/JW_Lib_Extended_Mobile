<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">October 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 10/06 Vol. 49, No. 10</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What Do You Put First?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> How would you answer that question? Of course, all of us desire to put Kingdom interests first. (Matt. 6:33) But we might ask ourselves, ‘Do the choices I make show that I am?’ The Bible encourages us: “Keep proving what you yourselves are,” (2 Cor, 13:5) How can we prove to ourselves that we are putting the Kingdom first?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Our Time: </span><span class="font10">We could start by examining how we choose to spend our time. (Eph. 5:15, 16) How much time is spent each week socializing, watchingtelevision, surfing the Internet, or pursuing a hobby? If we write down how much time we spend on such things and compare that with the amount of time we spend in spiritual activities, we may be surprised. Do we spend long hours at work at the expense of sacred service just so that we can afford luxuries? How often do we sacrifice meetings or the ministry to take weekend trips for recreation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Set Priorities: </span><span class="font10">Most Of us do not have enough time to do everything we would like. So to put Kingdom interests first, we need to assess our priorities and then schedule time for “the more important things.” (Phil, 1:10) These include studying God’s Word, sharing in the ministry, caring for one’s family, and attending Christian meetings. (PS. 1:1, 2; Rom. 10:13, 14; 1 Tim. 5:8; Heb. 10:24, 25) Other activities, such as moderate exercise and wholesome recreation, are beneficial. (Mark 6:31; 1 Tim. 4:8) But these less important things must be kept in their place.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> One young brother sought to put Kingdom interests first by entering the full-time ministry rather than pursuing higher education in preparation for a secular career. He learned another language and moved to serve where the need was greater. He said: “I am having the time of my life here. The ministry is so refreshing! I just wish that every young person would do something like this and feel what I feel. There is nothing better than to serve Jehovah with all we have.” Yes, putting the Kingdom first brings us blessings, but more important, it pleases our heavenly Father, Jehovah.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Become Friends of God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Today, people out of all nations are being taught Jehovah’s ways. (Isa. 2:2, 3) For such ones to “bear fruit with endurance,” however, they must come to love Jehovah. (Luke 8:15; Mark 12: 30) Without such love, they will not have the strength to resist unwholesome influences or the courage to do what is right. One way to help others develop a good relationship with Jehovah is to build in them appreciation for his qualities. Encourage them to give thoughtful consideration to the information in the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Draw Close to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Your Example: </span><span class="font10">Your personal actions can have a powerful effect on the hearts of Bible students. When they see that you treasure your friendship with Jehovah and see how it affects your life, they may be motivated to cultivate such a personal relationship themselves. (Luke 6: 40) Indeed, our example often has a greater influence on others than what we say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A major means by which parents teach their children to love Jehovah is by their example. (Deut. 6:4-9) One couple desirous of raising their children in the truth asked successful parents for advice. “The common thread with everyone I spoke to was parental example,” said the husband. Thus, by their entire way of life, parents can give their children a living example of what it means to be “Jehovah’s friend.”—Jas. 2:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Heartfelt Prayer: </span><span class="font10">You can also help others to cultivate friendship with Jehovah by teaching them to pray from the heart. You might direct them to Jesus’ model prayer, as well as to the many earnest prayers recorded in the Scriptures. (Matt. 6:9, 10) You can teach your children and Bible students how to pray by your own prayers. When they hear your heartfelt expressions, they sense your feelings toward Jehovah. Encourage them to “persevere in prayer” when they face trials. (Rom. 12:12) As they experience Jehovah’s help in times of need, they will come to trust him and love him as a true friend.—Ps. 34:8; Phil. 4:6, 7.</span></p>

They enable us to share in group witnessing so that we can work along with others for mutual support and training. (Prov. 27:17; Eccl. 4:9, 10) What can we do to benefit fully from these meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Conductor: </span><span class="font10">Specific information to be considered at these meetings is not normally outlined in advance. Therefore, good preparation is needed if you will be conducting. Do not automatically plan to consider the daily text, though you may choose to include it in the discussion if it directly relates to the ministry. Think about what will provide practical help for those witnessing that day. For example, you may want to discuss or demonstrate a presentation. You might choose to review something from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School </span><span class="font10">book, or a recent Service Meeting part. At other times, you might consider how to deal with a challenge that may arise in your territory, or you might discuss how to cultivate interest and start Bible studies, especially if many will be making return visits. Regardless of what is considered, be enthusiastic and positive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">3. How long should the meeting last, and what should be accomplished during that time? will be late. Use good judgment in organizing the groups, and provide territory to those who need it. The length of the meeting should be no more than 10 to 15 minutes and shorter if it follows a congregation meeting. Before you end the meeting, all should know with whom and where they are going to work. The meeting should be concluded with prayer.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> You Can Help: </span><span class="font10">As with congregation meetings, we show respect for Jehovah and consideration for others by arriving on time. Participate in the discussion. You may let the conductor assign you to work with someone, or you may choose to make your own arrangements in advance of the meeting. If you prefer to make your own arrangements, endeavor to “widen out” by working with a variety of publishers, rather than working with close friends each time. (2 Cor. 6:11-13) Once the meeting has concluded, avoid changing the arrangements, and depart promptly for the territory.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The purpose of meetings for field service is the same as that of congregation meetings. They are arranged so that we can “consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) If we strive to benefit from these meetings, we will be helped to carry out our ministry—a ‘fine work’ indeed!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">February 2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 2/06 Vol. 49, No. 2</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Create Opportunities to Preach</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The Christian congregation is made up of people with a wide variety of circumstances. Yet, we are united in our determination to praise Jehovah. (Ps. 79:13) If poor health or other challenging circumstances limit our share in proclaiming the good news, how can we create opportunities to preach?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Daily Activities: </span><span class="font0">Jesus took advantage of his everyday dealings with people to<sup>-</sup>give a witness. He spoke to Matthew while passing a tax office, to Zacchaeus while traveling, and to a Samaritan woman while resting. (Matt. 9:9; Luke 19:1-5; John 4:6-10) In our dally activities, we too can turn an ordinary conversation into a witness. Having a Bible handy, along with tracts or brochures, will encourage us to be ready to speak about our hope.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Does impaired mobility limit your participation in the door-to-door work? Be alert to opportunities to witness to visiting medical personnel and others with whom you come in contact. (Acts 28:30, 31) If circumstances often keep you at home, have you tried witnessing by telephone or by letter? One sister regularly writes to non-Witness family members. She includes encouraging thoughts from the Bible and experiences she has had while witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> At Work or School: </span><span class="font0">Our desire to praise Jehovah will also move us to create opportunities to plant seeds of truth at work or school. An eight-year-old publisher shared with his class what he read in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font0">about the moon. After learning where he got the information, his teacher began accepting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font0">on a regular basis. At the workplace, our simply keeping a copy of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book where others can see it may prompt questions and lead to a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Can you think of ways to create opportunities to preach in your daily activities? By making the most of our circumstances, may we strive each day to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">—By Being Prepared</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Good preparation for the ministry helps us to show personal interest in others. How so? When we are well prepared, we are less preoccupied with our presentation and so can give greater attention to the householder. Further, it helps us to overcome nervousness and allows us to speak from the heart. How, though, can we prepare an effective presentation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Use a Presentation That Fits: </span><span class="font0">Select from the January 2006 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> one of the suggested presentations that is appropriate for your area, and consider how you can put it in your own words. Adapt it to your territory. For example, if you are likely to meet people of a certain religious or ethnic background, think of how your presentation can appeal to them. Tailoring your approach to the individuals with whom you speak reflects sincere interest in them. —1 Cor. 9:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> As you begin using the presentation, continue to refine it. Since the opening words are especially important, note how people respond to your introduction. Does the subject interest them? Do the questions you pose bring a response? If not, make adjustments until you find an approach that works.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Memory Aids: </span><span class="font0">Many find it a challenge to remember a presentation when they are at the door. If you find that to be so, have you tried having practice sessions in which you give the presentation out loud to another person? This can help you to get the ideas clearly in mind and present them in a simple, logical manner. It can also prepare you to handle the variety of responses you may get.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Another memory aid is to write a short summary of the presentation on an index card and glance at it just before you approach the door. Some find that this brief reminder helps them to be more relaxed and better able to converse with people. In these ways, good preparation can help us to show personal interest in others and thus enhance our presentation of the good news.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Draw Attention to “the Light of the World”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah foretold: “The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light. As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.” (Isa. 9:2) That “great light” was seen in the works of God’s own Son, Jesus Christ. His work while on earth and the blessings resulting from his sacrifice uplifted those who were in darkness spiritually. Such light is what people need in these darkened times. The Lord’s Evening Meal provides a special opportunity for us to draw attention to “the light of the world.” (John 8:12) Last year, millions displayed a measure of faith by joining us in obeying Jesus’ command: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) As this year’s Memorial observance approaches, how can we share in calling attention to the great light that Jehovah has caused to shine forth?—Phil. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Build Heart Appreciation: </span><span class="font1">The Memorial season is an opportune time to meditate on the great love that Jehovah and Jesus showed in providing the ransom sacrifice for mankind. (John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15) Doing so will no doubt intensify our heart appreciation for this sacred occasion. AU of God’s people will want to set aside time to read and meditate on the special Memorial Bible reading, as outlined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily.</span><span class="font1"> Thinking of Jehovah’s matchless qualities, which are so gloriously revealed in his provision of the ransom, makes us proud to have him</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. What great light was foretold in God’s Word, and what occasion draws special attention to this light?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. How can we intensify our heart appreciation for the ransom sacrifice, and what effect will doing so have?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">as our God. Reflecting upon what the ransom means for us personally intensifies our heartfelt love for God and his Son and motivates us to exert ourselves in doing God’s will.—Gal. 2:20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> If we deepen our appreciation for Jehovah’s provision of salvation, our enthusiasm for the Memorial wiU radiate to Bible students, return visits, relatives, neighbors, schoolmates, workmates, and others whom we invite to this special occasion. (Luke 6:45) Therefore, make a special effort to invite all such ones, providing a printed Memorial invitation to serve as a reminder to them. So as not to forget anyone, many have found it practical to maintain a list of those they regularly invite to the Memorial, adding new ones annually. Taking an organized approach and earnestly following through in inviting interested ones would be a fine way of expressing our gratitude to Jehovah God “for his indescribable free gift.”—2 Cor. 9:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Increased Share in the Ministry: </span><span class="font1">Can you increase your share in the ministry during March and April? Endeavoring to share with others “the glorious good news about the Christ” will surely have God’s blessing. Jehovah, as the Source of all spiritual enlightenment, has commanded: “Let the light shine out of darkness.” (2 Cor. 4:4-6) As needed, the elders will arrange to have meetings for field service at extra times and locations, taking the lead to support longer witnessing periods. This may include early-morning street work or arrangements to do business territory</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">3. How can we demonstrate our appreciation for the Memorial?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">4. What can help us to increase our share in the ministry during March and April? </span><span class="font1">and telephone witnessing in the afternoon or early evening. As an aid to increasing your share in the ministry, set a reasonable goal of hours, and work hard to attain it. For many, giving Jehovah their best includes the privilege of auxiliary pioneering.—Col. 3:23, 24.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Can You Auxiliary Pioneer? </span><span class="font1">It has now been over seven years since the hour requirement for auxiliary pioneering was reduced. This adjustment has made it possible for many more to experience the blessings of auxiliary pioneer service. Have you tried it? Some make it their custom to do so each year. In many congregations dozens of publishers take up this form of service together, and it becomes a rewarding highlight of the congregation’s activity during the year. Can you make room for a joyful month of auxiliary pioneering during the Memorial season? April may be an especially good month for some, since it has five full weekends.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Is your congregation scheduled to have the visit of the circuit overseer during March or April? An added blessing may be open to you. As was previously announced, during the 2006 service year, all who are serving as auxiliary pioneers during the month in which the circuit overseer visits will be invited to attend the first half of the meeting held with the pioneers during the week of the visit. No doubt the spiritually strengthening information provided at this meeting will assist many auxiliary pioneers to reach out to become regular pioneers. In addition, during March we will have the joy of assisting people to come into the spiritual light by means of the new study publication </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font1"> Why not make it your goal to start a Bible study in the new book?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">5. How are many benefiting from the reduced hour requirement for auxiliary pioneering?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">6. What exciting provisions have been made available?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> As you consider the auxiliary pioneer requirement of 50 hours, determine what schedule will allow you to shine forth the light of truth for about 12 hours each week. Talk it over with those who have successfully done so, as well as with others. This may encourage them to join you. With good planning, baptized publishers, young and old alike, have found that it was not too difficult to reach this commendable goal. Pray about it. Then, if possible, make your plans, and enjoy auxiliary pioneering!—Mal. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> Many families have found that a well-coordinated effort can make it possible for at least one family member to attain this goal. One family decided that all five baptized members would enroll as auxiliary pioneers. Two other children who were not yet baptized made a special effort to increase their activity. How did the family benefit from making an extra effort? They wrote: “It was such an agreeable month, and we strongly felt that the family bonds were strengthened. We thank Jehovah for the wonderful blessing!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> Will our special activity during March and April prove to be stimulating, drawing us closer to our heavenly Father? Much will depend on the personal effort we put forth toward intensifying our love for God and his Son and increasing our share in the ministry. May our resolve be like that of the psalmist, who sang: “I shall laud Jehovah very much with my mouth, and in among many people I shall praise him.” (Ps. 109: 30) Jehovah will bless our zealous activity this Memorial season. So may we let a great light shine forth so that many more can come out of darkness and “possess the light of life.”—John 8:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">7, 8. (a) What can help us to make a schedule to auxiliary pioneer? (b) How can family cooperation help, and how does the entire family benefit?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">9. How can we let our light shine during this Memorial season?</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Help That Is Readily to Be Found</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Anna, a sister with an unbelieving husband and a demanding work schedule, found it a struggle to attend Christian meetings regularly, participate in the ministry, and study God’s Word. Though she still loved Jehovah, she became inactive. Happily, she received spiritual assistance from concerned elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Accepting the spiritual help offered through the Christian congregation demonstrates reliance on Jehovah himself. In imitation of Jesus Christ’s loving care, the older men in the congregation seek opportunities to offer encouragement and practical assistance to those experiencing spiritual difficulty. (1 Thess. 5:14) Oftentimes, a kind word of encouragement centered on reassuring Scriptural passages can be just what is needed. Reaching out to support those in a temporarily weak condition is of concern to all Christians, not just the elders. No doubt each of us has experienced the power of a thoughtful “word spoken at the right time for it.”—Prov. 25:11; Isa. 35:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Take the Initiative: </span><span class="font0">Showing loving interest in those who need help requires that we take the initiative, show fellow feeling, and be earnest. When Jonathan became aware of David’s distressing situation, he “rose up and went to David at Horesh, that he might strengthen his hand.” (1 Sam. 23:15, 16) Use a gentle approach to help others. Words motivated by genuine concern yield the best results. Furthermore, Jesus clearly illustrated that diligent, purposeful effort is involved in regaining a spiritual brother or sister. (Luke 15:4) Having an earnest desire to assist another person will move us to persevere in offering help even if progress is not quickly manifest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> How encouraging it is when we take the initiative to invite others, such as those in our book study, to accompany us in the ministry! As we assist a fellow servant of Jehovah</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">1. How can one’s spirituality weaken?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">2. In what way can all Christians prove to be a help that is readily to be found?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">3, 4. What is involved in helping others, and how may we do so?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">to engage in the ministry, we may use the opportunity to strengthen that one’s hand. Such joyful times spent together in Jehovah’s service are especially encouraging to those who are recovering their spiritual balance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> A Loving Provision: </span><span class="font0">Those who have not shared in the preaching work or associated with the congregation for some time may need additional help to build up their faith. A personal Bible study in a publication such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God, Draw Close to Jehovah,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font0"> may be just what is needed. Since the person is already baptized, generally the study need not be continued for a prolonged period. The Congregation Service Committee should be alert to observe who might benefit from this provision.—See the November 1998 and November 2000 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> Question Boxes.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Anna, mentioned earlier, gratefully accepted the elders’ offer to have a spiritually mature sister conduct a Bible study with her. It took just four study sessions to help her draw close to Jehovah once again. She resumed attending congregation meetings and rekindled her desire to praise Jehovah God publicly. The mature sister also helped her in the ministry by taking her on other Bible studies until she was sufficiently strengthened to preach from door to door. A helping hand was all that she needed to get going again!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Strengthening those in need brings blessings to all. The one being helped enjoys the happiness of drawing close to Jehovah and becoming involved with the activities of His organization. The elders rejoice to see such spiritual progress. (Luke 15:5, 6) The congregation is drawn together in unity as all show loving concern for one another. (Col. 3:12-14) What good reasons we have to imitate Jehovah, a help that is readily to be found!—Eph. 5:1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> An exciting feature of the “Godly Obedience” District Conventions was the release of the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font0"> We will soon be using it extensively in our field ministry, especially when we conduct home Bible studies. Therefore, we need to become well acquainted with this new publication. That will be possible because we will be studying it at the Congregation Book Study beginning the week of April 17, 2006.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> The Congregation Book Study overseer will call attention to the questions that appear at the start of each chapter. Then the study will be conducted by using the questions at the bottom of the page. Key scriptures will be read and discussed, and the box “What the Bible Teaches” at the end of each chapter will be helpful in reviewing the material because the box contains the Scriptural answers to the chapter’s introductory questions. You will enjoy commenting, since this book covers subjects in a clear, simple, and interesting way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> The appendix of this book provides details on various topics. We will be able to use this material when Bible students need more information on a certain subject. Portions of the appendix will at times be covered during the Congregation Book Study. All the appendix material on a topic will be read by the book study reader, and the longer articles can be covered in sections. Study questions do not appear in the appendix. But the overseer can draw comments from those present by asking questions that highlight main points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Studies of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book will move along briskly at the Congregation Book Study. We are not expected to keep that pace when we study this publication with others, particularly if they have little or no Bible knowledge. (Acts 26: 28, 29) During home Bible studies, we will need to discuss scriptures more thoroughly, explain illustrations, and so forth. So make it your goal to be in attendance every week and to share fully in our study of the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> To convey important information to his ancient servants, Jehovah at times used visions and dreams. Think of Ezekiel’s vision of Jehovah’s celestial chariot. (Ezek. 1:1-28) Imagine how Daniel felt after receiving the prophetic dream depicting the march of world powers. (Dan. 7:1-15,28) And what about the electrifying revelation presented “in signs” to the apostle John regarding things that would take place during “the Lord’s day”? (Rev. 1:1, 10) Jehovah taught them using vivid color and dynamic action, and it made a lasting impression on their minds.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> If we want to convey Bible truths to others with an impact that will not easily be forgotten, we can likewise use our videos to teach. Our videos cover a wide range of topics and build confidence in the Bible, in Jehovah’s organization, and in principles that enhance Christian living. Consider a few ways we can use our videos to teach. The following are a sample of the videos that may be used.</span></p></li>

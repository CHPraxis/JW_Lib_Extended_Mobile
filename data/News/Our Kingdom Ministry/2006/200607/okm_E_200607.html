<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Build Appreciation for Jehovah’s Matchless Qualities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> In our ministry, we do more than teach others basic Bible truths. We help people get to know Jehovah as a person and build appreciation for his matchless qualities. When hon-esthearted ones learn the truth about God, it has a profound effect on them, moving them to make changes in their lives “in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him.”—Col. 1:9, 10; 3:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Our New Study Aid: </span><span class="font0">From the outset, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book draws attention to Jehovah’s qualities. The very first chapter answers the questions: Does God really care about you?, What is God like?, and Is it possible to get close to God? That chapter also highlights Jehovah’s holiness (par. 10), his justice and compassion (par. 11), his love (par. 13), his power (par. 16), and his mercy, graciousness, willingness to forgive, patience, and loyalty (par. 19). Paragraph 20 sums up the matter by stating: “The more you learn about Jehovah, the more real he will become to you and the more reason you will have to love him and feel close to him.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> How can we use the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book to help Bible students draw close to Jehovah? After considering a paragraph that highlights one of God’s qualities, we might ask the student, “What does this tell you about Jehovah as a person?” or “How does this show God’s interest in you personally?” By occasionally using such questions during the study, we teach our students to meditate on what they are learning and help them to grow in appreciation for Jehovah’s matchless qualities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use the Review Box: </span><span class="font0">At the conclusion of each chapter, invite the student to comment in his own words on each point in the box “What the Bible Teaches.” Direct attention to the cited scriptures. To draw up what is in the student’s heart, you might at times ask, “How do you feel about what the Bible teaches on this point?” By so doing, you not only emphasize the main points of the chapter but also get valuable insight into a student’s true belief. This will help the student to begin developing a relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Our “Happy God,” Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah truly wants people to be happy. His Word fills us with anticipation for the marvelous blessings he has in store for mankind. (Isa. 65:21-25) It should be evident to others that we find joy in sharing “the glorious good news of the happy God” with them. (1 Tim. 1: 11) The way in which we speak about the Kingdom message should reflect our love for the truth and our genuine interest in the people to whom we speak.—Rom. 1:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Admittedly, at times it can be a challenge to maintain a cheerful attitude. In some territories, we find few people who respond favorably to the Kingdom message. There may be days when we are dealing with difficult circumstances in our own life. To maintain a joyful spirit, we do well to reflect on just how much the people in our territory need to hear and get the sense of the Kingdom good news we are preaching. (Rom. 10:13, 14, 17) Meditating on this will help us to continue joyfully making known Jehovah’s merciful provisions for salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Focus on the Positive: </span><span class="font0">We also need to give attention to what we say. Although we may begin a discussion by mentioning a problem or a news item that is on people’s minds, we should avoid needlessly dwelling on negative things. Our commission is to bring “good news of something better.” (Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:15) This good news is a message based on God’s promises of a brighter future. (2 Pet. 3:13) With this in mind, use the Scriptures to “bind up the brokenhearted.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) This will help each of us to maintain a cheerful spirit and a positive manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> People will without fail notice our cheerful attitude as we share in the preaching work. So, then, let us always reflect the disposition of our “happy God,” Jehovah, as we share the Kingdom good news with the people in our territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">■ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31,2006, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Inventory </span><span class="font11">(S-18) form.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>They Have Set an Example of Faithfulness</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The year 1937 witnessed the beginning of a new avenue of full-time service—the special pioneer activity. Capable men and women, experienced in the Christian ministry, willingly accepted assignments to serve wherever the organization directed. Now, decades later, special pioneers continue to set an example of faithfulness worthy of imitation. —Heb. 6:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> They Took the Lead: </span><span class="font0">At the outset, special pioneers spearheaded the preaching work by using the portable phonograph at the householder’s doorstep. They also used recordings as the basis for Bible discussions on return visits. This was done in large cities where congregations were already established. Later, special pioneers were sent into areas where there was a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers. They followed up on all interest and conducted Bible studies. As a result of their earnest efforts, hundreds of new congregations were formed. Their tireless evangelizing contributed to the tremendous expansion of the organization that we see today. (Isa. 60:22) Special pioneers continue to play an important role in spreading the good news “in all creation that is under heaven.”—Col. 1:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>s</sup> Worthy of Imitation: </span><span class="font0">Some special pioneers have been serving in the full-time ministry for decades. Over the years, these loyal men and women have had their faith refined under various circumstances. (1 Pet. 1:6, 7) They have been willing to sacrifice material comforts in order to serve in places of special need. Some are now advanced in years and face poor health, or they confront other challenging circumstances. (2 Cor. 4:16, 17) Yet, they “keep on thriving during gray-headedness.” (Ps. 92:14) They put their trust in Jehovah and experience his blessing.—Ps. 34:8; Prov. 10:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">’Special pioneers certainly deserve our warm commendation. If you are privileged to have special pioneers assigned to your congregation, take advantage of the opportunity to spend time with them and benefit from their experience. Show appreciation for their service as faithful Kingdom proclaimers. Draw strength from their steadfastness. All who imitate their faith can likewise enjoy Jehovah’s favor and blessing because “those acting in faithfulness are a pleasure to him.”—Prov. 12:22.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> When you first became a Christian, you likely put forth much effort to develop a healthy routine of spiritual activities that included Bible study, Christian meetings, the field ministry, and prayer. As a result of Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts, you grew spiritually. Perhaps now a number of years have passed since you were baptized. Are you maintaining the good spiritual habits you developed as you were becoming a Christian?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Examine Your Routine: </span><span class="font0">Is it your habit to read a portion of God’s Word each day? What rich blessings we reap by doing so! (Josh. 1:8; Ps. 1:2, 3) In ancient Israel, each king was to read in his copy of the Law “all the days of his life.” With what benefits? He would develop a humble heart and learn to fear Jehovah so as not to turn aside from His commandments. (Deut. 17:18-20) Likewise today, daily Bible reading helps us to remain blameless and innocent amid this wicked, corrupt world. It also helps us to be fully equipped for the ministry.—Phil. 2:15; 2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Jesus had the custom of going to the synagogue, where the Scriptures were discussed. (Luke 4:16) No doubt this fortified him to face the trials he was to suffer. We too are strengthened by the spiritual instruction imparted at con-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> The inspired record tells us that the apostles shared in declaring the good news “every day in the temple and from house to house.” (Acts 5:42) While we may not be able to preach every day, can we make it our habit to participate in some form of the ministry every week? By doing so, we will surely become more proficient in handling God’s Word, and we will likely enjoy encouraging experiences in sharing Bible truth with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>0</sup> The prophet Daniel was richly blessed for serving Jehovah “with constancy” throughout his life. This included the habit of praying regularly to Jehovah. (Dan. 6: 10,16, 20) Likewise, as we regularly turn to Jehovah in heartfelt prayer, he will bless us with his holy spirit. (Luke 11:9-13) More than that, Jehovah will respond by drawing close to us, allowing us to enjoy an intimate relationship with him. (Ps. 25:14; Jas. 4:8) What a grand reward! May we, therefore, work diligently to maintain good spiritual habits and reap rich blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>

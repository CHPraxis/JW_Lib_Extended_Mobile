When visiting a field service group, what do you try to accomplish? How can those in the group gain the most benefit from your visit? How do you assist individual publishers who approach you to receive help with a particular aspect of the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Improving Our Skills in the Ministry —Showing Personal Interest.” </span><span class="font5">Discussion. After discussing the article, have a two-part demonstration. First, have a publisher present the offer for the month without showing personal interest. Then, demonstrate the situation again, this time with the publisher showing personal interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Song 84 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Showing Personal Interest</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Why Important: Jesus viewed people as individuals, and he showed loving personal interest in them. For example, on one occasion Jesus may have sensed some uneasiness in a deaf man, so when he healed him, he did so privately, away from the stares of the crowd. (Mark 7:31-35) He showed consideration for his disciples by recognizing their limitations and not overwhelming them with too much information. ( John 16:12) Even in his heavenly position, Jesus shows personal interest. (2 Tim. 4:17) As followers of Christ, we want to imitate him. (1 Pet. 2:21; 1 John 3: 16, 18) Furthermore, we will be more effective in our ministry if we show consideration for the householder and take note of his unique circumstances, his interests, and his concerns. He will be more likely to listen if he senses that we are not just on a mission to deliver a message or to leave literature; rather, we are interested in him personally.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How to Do It:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> Be well-prepared. Relax, smile, and be friendly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> Be observant. Do you see indications that the person has children? that he enjoys gardening or has pets? that he has certain religious beliefs? Perhaps you can tailor your introduction to fit his circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> Ask for his opinion, and listen carefully without needlessly interrupting. Maintain eye contact to show that you are listening. Acknowledge his comments, and commend him if you can do so sincerely. Avoid being argumentative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> Be adaptable. If necessary, adjust your presentation to address the person’s concerns. This may be easier than you think, since our tracts, brochures, and magazines discuss a wide variety of subjects. If you have called at an inopportune time, such as when he is busy, acknowledge that and shorten your presentation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> Have practice sessions during family worship, or perhaps while in the ministry, in which the publisher must adapt his presentation to address something the householder says.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font6"> During some meetings for field service, the brother conducting could discuss or demonstrate ways to show personal interest.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark13"></a>An Exciting and Fresh Approach to Public Witnessing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Congregations that have areas of high pedestrian traffic have been encouraged to or</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ganiz</span><span class="font6">e public witnessing, using tables or mo-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. What have congregations with areas of high pedestrian traffic been encouraged to do? bile displays. If a mobile display is used, at least one publisher stands or sits next to the display. However, two publishers should man a table display. Those stationed at the displays endeavor to be warm, friendly, and inviting. If a person gives his attention to the display, one of the publishers can start a conversation, perhaps by saying, “Have you ever wondered what the Bible says about that subject?” Another publisher or two can be within eyesight of the display while engaging in informal witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> This approach has resulted in many new Bible studies. One college student chose to write a research paper on Jehovah’s Witnesses, but she was unable to find a Kingdom Hall. The next week she saw a table display on the campus. A Bible study was started, and now that student is a baptized publisher and participates in this form of witnessing herself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> One sister who has enjoyed this form of public witnessing commented: “Some stop at the display to pick up the current magazines. Others have never heard of Jehovah’s Witnesses before. I can see that with this approach, many can be reached.” Another sister remarked, “This is an exciting, fresh method of witnessing because the people come to you and, at the very least, they are curious.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> It is beneficial to set up the display at the same location, on the same days, and at the same times each week. As a result, people get used to seeing the displays and eventually feel comfortable enough to approach and ask questions or obtain literature. Has your congregation organized public witnessing? If so, perhaps you can participate in this enjoyable and fruitful way to “declare abroad the Kingdom of God.”—Luke 9:60.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Use Our Web Site in the Ministry —“Bible Questions Answered”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The “Bible Teachings” section of jw.org has a feature called “Bible Questions Answered.” If we are familiar with these frequently asked questions, we can direct inquiring householders to our Web site for Scriptural answers. These questions can also be used to start conversations in the ministry. We could pick a question that is of interest to people in our territory, ask the householder for his opinion, and then tell him what the Bible says, using the reasoning from jw.org. Afterward, we can explain or show him where we found our information. Another option is to let him read the answer directly from the Web site. The wife of a traveling overseer has had good success by saying: “Many people wonder, ‘Is God to blame for our suffering?’ Would you like to know the answer in just 51 seconds?” She then plays the audio version of the answer that she has downloaded to her mobile device. She concludes by introducing chapter 11 of the Bible Teach book.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark19"></a>“I Cannot Find Him at Home Again!”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Have you ever said that about someone who showed interest? Even though you have repeatedly tried to visit the person, you are unable to water the seed of truth you planted. (1 Cor. 3:6) At times, experienced publishers write a letter to someone they have not been able to find at home, or they leave a note in the person’s door. Some publishers anticipate the challenge of finding the person at home again and request his phone number, perhaps by asking, “Do you text?” A return visit may be counted when we visit the person or witness to him by means of a letter, an e-mail, a text, a note left in his door, or a telephone call. Even if he is seldom at home, it is possible for us to further his interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark21"></a>A New Research Tool</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of publishers earth wide have made good use of the Watch Tower Publications Index to do research. However, because it is very detailed, it is available in only a limited number of languages. Therefore, the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses has been prepared in some 170 languages. The publications referenced in the Research Guide are primarily from the year 2000 onward. The Research Guide has not been printed in languages that already have the Index but is included in electronic format in Watchtower Library and Watchtower—ONLINE LIBRARY. The Research Guide will help you search for answers to Bible questions, find information regarding personal concerns, and prepare for congregation meetings and family worship.</span></p>

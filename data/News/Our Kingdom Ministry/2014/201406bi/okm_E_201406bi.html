<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Loud Shout of Praise: </span><span class="font9">To help publishers expand their ministry, a special provision has been made for any who wish to auxiliary pioneer in the month of August. During that month, baptized publishers will be allowed to auxiliary pioneer with a 30-hour requirement. Although the conventions are in August, there are still four Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and thus publishers who work secularly or go to school during the week may be able to auxiliary pioneer. If you have a progressive Bible student or a child who would like to become a publisher, speak to the coordinator of the body of elders right away. How encouraging it would be for such ones to join us as publishers during this momentous month! Although many regular pioneers take vacation during August after fulfilling their yearly hour requirement, it may be possible for them to adjust their schedule in order to have a full share in this special campaign. Now is the time for families to discuss how they will contribute to the “loud shout of praise to Jehovah” that will go up during August.—Ezra 3:11; Prov. 15:22.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Remember Those in Nursing Homes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many people are facing the debilitating effects of advancing age. (Eccl. 12:1-7) Some older ones live in nursing homes, so it is not always possible for us to reach them through house-to-house preaching. This is true even in lands where aging parents traditionally move in with their children or other relatives. Although perhaps limited in mobility or memory, elderly ones and others who live in nursing homes may still be able to learn about, appreciate, and come to love Jehovah. How can we reach out to share the good news of “the </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">happ</span><span class="font10">y hope” with them?—Titus 2:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Why is there a need to reach those in nursing homes with the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Getting Sta rted: </span><span class="font10">Usually a list of nursing-care facilities can be compiled by searching the local telephone directory. Check categories such as “nursing homes,” “group homes,” and “residential-care facilities.” The service overseer can take the lead in arranging for qualified publishers to visit each facility. With good planning and reliance on Jehovah, it is often possible to start a group Bible study.—Prov. 21:5; 1 John 5: 14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The manner in which the study is introduced depends on the type of facility. In large facilities with many residents and staff members, it is best to approach the receptionist and ask to speak with the director of activities. In small group homes for seniors—homes with a few residents and two or three caregivers—it may be best to schedule a time to speak directly with the owner of the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In either situation, explain that you are volunteering your time to encourage individuals who enjoy reading and discussing Bible accounts. Ask if there are any residents who might like to participate in a group Bible discussion for about 30 minutes a week. A variety of publications can be used, but many find that My Book of Bible Stories and The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived are well received. You may wish to show the publications to the director. The day, time, and meeting room location can be worked out with him or her and will typically be posted on an activities calendar in the nursing home. Do not shy away from identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Witn</span><span class="font10">esses. At the same time, help the di-</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">3, 4. (a) Whom should we approach to introduce the group study? (b) How might we outline the study arrangement? </span><span class="font10">rector to understand that you would not be coming to conduct a religious service but, rather, to promote Bible education.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Conducting the Study: </span><span class="font10">How you conduct the study depends on the circumstances and environment at the facility, so be flexible and discerning. The conductor should bring several copies of the publication being considered and should collect them at the end of the study. It may be necessary to bring enlarged copies of the material for some. Paragraphs can be read, questions can be asked, and responses can be given in our usual manner. Those willing and capable may be invited to read the paragraphs or Bible passages. During the study, be engaging, positive, and friendly. With the permission of the director, you can occasionally show one of the organization’s videos that builds faith in the Bible or highlights lessons from a particular Bible account. It may be possible to open and close the study with a simple prayer. Some publishers have even introduced Kingdom songs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> What if a resident objects to something that is read or stated during the study? Use discernment when you reply. (Col. 4:6) Perhaps you can share a brief Bible text that clearly addresses his concern. If it is not practical for you to do so, then it would be best to acknowledge his comment and offer to consider the matter with him separately after the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> On occasion, a resident may ask a question or express a desire to learn more. One sister uses this approach: “That’s a very good question. But since that is your personal question, let’s wait until the end of </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">our r</span><span class="font10">eading. Then you and I can discuss it</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">5. What practical suggestions will make the study enjoyable and beneficial?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">6. How might an objection be handled?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">7. What can you do if a resident has a personal question or shows exceptional interest? </span><span class="font10">together.” It is often possible to arrange to conduct a personal Bible study with interested ones at another time and in a different setting.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> It is usually best for the same Witnesses to conduct the group study at the facility each time. Any publishers who participate may count the time. Once the study is established, the publisher taking the lead may count one return visit every time the group study is conducted and one Bible study each month. Bible studies that are started with individual residents who are able to understand and learn may be counted in the usual way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Keeping It Going: </span><span class="font10">It is best to have a set day and time for the group study. The residents and staff will expect it to be held regularly and to start and end on time. (Matt. 5:37) Therefore, commitment, diligence, and orderliness are required. Experience has shown that it is best if two qualified publishers work together to conduct the group study. (Eccl. 4:9, 10) In large facilities, more publishers might be needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Friendliness and personal interest are also important. (Phil. 2:4) On the first visit, take time to meet each resident who attends. Make note of and try to memorize their names before the next study. However, some older people are offended if someone they do not know addresses them by their first name. Patience and compassion will make everyone feel welcome and appreciated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> It is also essential to demonstrate respect for and show kindness to the facility staff and family members of the residents. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Once</span><span class="font10"> the study arrangement is set, it is wise</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">8. How should group studies and any personal Bible studies that result be counted?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">9, 10. What qualities are necessary for those involved in this work? Explain.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">11. How can those conducting the group study show respect for the staff and family members of the residents?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">not to change the time or format without first discussing it with the director. From time to time, ask the director for input on how the study is going. When family members visit during the study, take the initiative to meet them. Explain to them the purpose of the Bible study activity. Reassure them of your sincere interest in their family member. Invite them to sit in and listen to the study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Results: </span><span class="font10">Traveling overseers and congregations report encouraging results from this avenue of service. In one case, about 20 residents attended the first discussion. This led to individual Bible studies with six residents. One was eventually baptized. A study in another home motivated an 85-year-old woman to associate with the local congregation and express her desire to be baptized. When one facility decided to consolidate its activities—eliminating the group study conducted by Jehovah’s Wit-nesses—the residents complained to the facility director! Eventually the study was started again and thereafter between 25 and 30 people attended.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> The love we show to those in nursing homes leaves a deep impression on more than just the residents. For example, it is not unusual for staff members to sit in on and even participate in the study. The effort we put forth to show personal interest to those in nursing homes also gives a favorable witness to the community. (1 Pet. 2:12) After being told the purpose of the study, one administrator said: “What took you so long? When can you start?” Another director wrote: “I would heartily recommend this group study to any nursing-care facility in the area. Jehovah’s Witnesses provide this free service as part of their ministerial work in the community.” One </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nurs</span><span class="font10">ing home in Hawaii gave Jehovah’s</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">12, 13. Relate experiences illustrating the benefits of witnessing in nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Witnesses a Volunteer Service Award that described the volunteers as a “priceless treasure” to those in that facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> The elderly are invited by Jehovah to praise him. (Ps. 148:12, 13) That invitation includes those in nursing homes. Are there nursing homes within your territory where elderly ones would benefit from hearing the good news? With the help of the local elders and the nursing-home directors, we may be able to give a good witness to those in nursing homes. When we remember those of advancing years, we imitate Je-</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">hova</span><span class="font10">h.—Ps. 71:9, 18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Householders who have difficulty reading may be interested in spiritual things, but they could be intimidated by the Bible and other books. Offering such people the Bible Teach book, at least initially, may meet with little success. How can we help them spiritually? We asked experienced publishers from over 20 different countries what they do. Their suggestions follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If the student has limited or no read</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing a</span><span class="font10">bility, you might start with a bro-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Teaching the Bible to those who have difficulty reading presents what challenge?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. What tools are effective in helping someone who has difficulty reading? </span><span class="font10">chure, either Listen to God or Listen to God and Live Forever. One pioneer from the United States shows the person both brochures and asks which one he is more comfortable with. The branch office in Kenya reports that these tools have been very effective there because in African society, people are traditionally taught through storytelling rather than question-and-answer discussions. Whereas an educated person might easily accept reading and questioning, that method might make someone with little formal education uncomfortable. If the student has some reading ability, many publishers like to start in the brochures Good News From God! or You Can Be God’s Friend! or perhaps My Book of Bible Stories.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font9">Commend: </span><span class="font10">Those who have not learned to read may feel embarrassed, and many have low self-worth. Helping them feel comfortable is often the first step toward teaching them the truth. Most people who cannot read are intelligent and are able to learn. Show them due respect, and treat them with dignity. (1 Pet. 3: 15) They will be motivated to continue the study if they feel that their efforts are worthwhile and that they are making spiritual progress. So be generous in commending them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Even if the student has limited reading ability, encourage him to prepare for his study. Some publishers in South Africa encourage their students to ask a family member or friend who can read well to help the students.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font9"> Be Patient: </span><span class="font10">Regardless of the publication you use, focus on the main points, and help your student to understand them well. In the beginning, discussions of 10 to 15 minutes may be best. Do not try to cover too much material, perhaps just a few paragraphs each session. Be patient if the student reads slowly. He will likely be motivated to improve his reading ability as he develops appreciation for Jehovah. To help your student do that, it is good to invite him to attend the meetings from the start.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If Bible students learn how to read, they will make faster spiritual progress. (Ps. 1:1-3) Many have helped their students by using the publication Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing for a few minutes at the end of each study. If the student gets discouraged, perhaps you can build up his confidence by pointing out some things that he was able to learn how to do. Assure him that Jehovah will bless his efforts, and encourage him to pray for help. (Prov. 16:3; 1 John 5:14, 15) Some publishers in Britain encourage their students to set reasonable but progressive goals—perhaps first mastering the alpha-</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who have not learned to read may feel embarrassed, and many have low self-worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping them feel comfortable is often the first step toward teaching them the truth</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">bet, then finding and reading selected scriptures, and finally reading from simplified Bible publications. Helping people learn how to read often involves motivating them to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font10"> to do it, not just teaching them how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah does not look down on those with little secular education. (Job 34:19) It is the person’s heart that Jehovah is searching. (1 Chron. 28:9) So do not hold back from introducing the truth to those who have difficulty reading. You have many excellent tools that you can start with. Eventually, you can transfer the study to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font10"> book and give him a more rounded understanding of the Scriptures.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Prompt Follow-Through Needed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Since our redesigned Web site was launched, online requests for Bible studies have increased dramatically. Additional requests have been generated by new public witnessing initiatives. The branch office processes these as quickly as possible. For example, if a request is made on jw.org, the elders in the interested person’s territory often receive notification from the branch office just two days later. Reports from the field indicate, however, that some who request a Bible study have not been contacted for several weeks. How can we ensure that help is given before the person’s interest fades?—Mark 4:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a person who does not live in your territory shows interest, promptly fill out a Please Follow Up (S-43) form and give it to the secretary no later than your next meeting. Within a day or two, the secretary should give the information to the appropriate congregation or submit it to the branch office using the Congregation tab on jw.org. Elders should check the Web site regularly. If they receive a notice to call on someone, they should follow through quickly. Any publisher asked to make the call should consider it a priority. If the person is not at home, perhaps you could leave a note with your contact information.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Why was Aaron not punished for making the golden calf? (Ex. 32:1-8, 25-35) [May 19, w04 3/15 p. 27 par. 4]</span></p></li>

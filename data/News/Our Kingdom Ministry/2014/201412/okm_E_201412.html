(See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> April 1, 2002, p. 16, pars. 5-7.) In turn, we should share our “good things” with others.

<p><span class="font13">Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Demonstrating a Bible Study by Using the Bible Teach Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Why Important: Many people may not understand what we mean when we say that we offer free home Bible studies. They may think that they have to join a study group or take some sort of correspondence course. Instead of simply offering a study, why not demonstrate a study? In just a few minutes, even on the doorstep, you can show a person what an easy and enlightening experience it can be to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> After introducing yourself, ask the householder if he is concerned about the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Mention that many people have similar concerns, and show him the table of contents in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book. Explain that this book has easy-to-understand lessons that show what the Bible teaches about the future and other subjects, and ask him which chapter he is interested in.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Hand him a copy of the book, and direct him to the chapter that he selected. Explain that the questions at the beginning of the chapter are answered in the paragraphs that follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Ask the householder to read the first paragraph if he feels comfortable doing so. Then read the question for that paragraph, and consider the answer together. Look up and discuss scriptures cited in support of the answer. Show him how you have highlighted the answer in your book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Consider the next paragraph, but this time ask the householder to try answering the question in his own words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> Commend him, and make arrangements to return to complete the lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font11"> If appropriate, direct attention to the video on jw.org entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens ata Bible Study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>

After considering paragraph 3, have a two-part demonstration showing a publisher and a Bible student discussing paragraph 8 in chapter 15 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book. In the first demonstration, the publisher talks too much. In the second, the publisher asks viewpoint questions to help him discern the student’s thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Tool to Help You Prepare to Conduct Bible Studies. </span><span class="font11">Discussion. Draw the attention of the audience to the section ofjw.org entitled “What Does the Bible Teach?” (Look under BIBLE TEACHINGS </span><span class="font12">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">TEENAGERS.) Discuss how this material can be used to help us conduct effective Bible studies with young people as well as with older ones. How can the questions raised on these work sheets help us reach the student’s heart? Include a soliloquy of a publisher using one of these work sheets to help him think about the needs of his student and prepare effective questions. Conclude by encouraging the audience to become better teachers by endeavoring to reach their students’ hearts by using the good things we have to help others.—Prov. 20:5. Song 99 and Prayer</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> No one can serve God unless Jehovah “draws him.” (John 6:44) Even so, publishers who conduct Bible studies must do their part in helping people to draw close to their heavenly Father. (Jas. 4:8) This requires preparation. Simply reading each paragraph and asking the printed question is not enough to help our students grasp the message and make progress.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> To conduct effective studies, publishers must help their students to (1) understand what the Bible teaches, (2) accept what the Bible teaches, and (3) put into practice what the Bible teaches. (John 3: 16; 17:3; Jas. 2:26) It can take months to guide an individual through these steps. Yet, each step represents a stage in his developing a relationship with Jehovah and making a dedication to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> What Is the Bible Student Thinking?: </span><span class="font12">To discern if our Bible student understands and accepts what he is learning, avoid doing all the talking and encourage the student to express himself. (Jas. 1:19) Does he understand what the Bible says on the subject being considered? Can he explain the subject in his own words? How does he feel about what he has learned? Does he believe that what the Bible teaches is reasonable? (1 Thess. 2:13) Does he understand that what he is learning should make a difference in the way he lives his life? (Col. 3:10) In order to get </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">answ</span><span class="font12">ers to such questions, we need to ask</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>2015 Theocratic Ministry School Helps Us Improve Our Teaching</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist David wrote: “May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.” (Ps. 19:14) We too want our words to be pleasing to Jehovah because we treasure our privilege of speaking the truth in the congregation and in the ministry. The Theocratic Ministry School is one of the ways that Jehovah trains us for the ministry. This training takes place each week in the more than 111,000 congregations worldwide. It has helped brothers and sisters around the globe and from all walks of life to become adequately qualified as ministers of the good news, capable of teaching with persuasion, tact, and boldness.—Acts 19:8; Col. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The school schedule for 2015 will include subjects considered in “An Introduction to God’s Word” and the “Glossary of Bible Terms” found in the New World Translation, as well as material from Insigh t on the Scriptures, Volume 1. Additionally, adjustments have been made in the time allotted for Bible highlights and Assignment No. 1. These changes along with instructions on how parts on the school are to be presented are considered in the following paragraphs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12"> Bible Highlights: </span><span class="font13">Brothers assigned this part will have two minutes to consider one interesting and practical Scriptural point from the weekly Bible reading. Good preparation will result in sharing a point of value with the congregation within the allotted time. Thereafter, the congregation will have the customary six minutes to offer comments of 30 seconds or less on interesting points they found in the weekly Bible reading. It takes preparation and self-discipline to make a meaningful comment in 30 seconds, but doing so is good training for us. It also allows time for others to comment on what they have learned in their personal research.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12"> Assignment No. 1: </span><span class="font13">The time allotted for the Bible reading has been reduced to three minutes or less and will cover less material. Those who receive a reading assignment should rehearse it several times by reading it aloud and paying close attention to proper pronunciation and fluency in order to convey thoughts with understanding. All of Jehovah’s people should strive to read well, since reading plays an important role in our worship. How delighted we are that so many of our children read well! Parents are to be commended for their loving efforts to help their children become good readers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12"> Assignment No. 2: </span><span class="font13">This will be a five-minute presentation assigned to a sister. The assigned theme should be used. When an assignment is based on material found in the New Wo rld Translation, it should be applied to an aspect of field service that is realistic and practical for the local territory. When the assignment is based on a Bible character in Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 1, the student should study the information found under the Bible character’s name, select appropriate scriptures to be used, and show what can be learned from the example of the Bible character. Additional scriptures that tie in with the theme may be included. The school overseer will assign one assistant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font12"> Assignment No. 3: </span><span class="font13">This will be a five-minute presentation assigned to a brother or a sister. When assigned to a sister, this part should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 2. When assigned to a brother, the material that is based on Insight should be given as a talk with the audience in mind. The student should develop the assigned theme, select appropriate scriptures to be used, and show what can be learned from the example of the Bible character.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font12"> A New Feature of Assignment No. 3 for Brothers: </span><span class="font13">When the assignment is based on the material in the New World Translation, it should be presented as a demonstration of family worship or field service. Usually the school overseer will assign an assistant and the setting. The assistant should be a member of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">the student’s family or a brother in the congregation. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible princi-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">ples that tie in with may be included in the presentation. From time to time, an elder may be assigned to present this part. Elders may choose their own assistant and setting. Undoubtedly, it will be encouraging for the congregation to see elders demonstrate the art of teaching with a family member or another brother.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Make advancement by accepting and applying counsel</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font12"> Counsel: </span><span class="font13">The school overseer will use two minutes after each student’s presentation to give commendation as well as constructive counsel based on Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education. When the school overseer introduces a student’s part on the program, he will not announce the point of counsel the student is working on. After each presentation, the overseer should give the student sincere commendation, announce the point of counsel the student is working on and state specifically why the student did well on that point or kindly explain why it would be beneficial for the student to give that particular point further attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> The student’s counsel form can be found on pages 79 to 81 of his personal copy of the Ministry School book. After a student cares for his assignment, the school overseer will make the appropriate notations in the student’s book and will private-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">the theme ly ask whether the student did the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">exercise related to the assigned counsel point. Commendation as well as additional helpful suggestions may be given to the student after the meeting or at another time. The personal attention that each student receives in the school should be viewed as an opportunity to help him make spiritual advancement.—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> If a student talk runs overtime, the school overseer or an assistant should be alert to give a signal, such as a bell or a tapping noise, to indicate in a discreet manner that the student’s time is up. The student should acknowledge the signal by completing his sentence and leaving the platform.—See Ministry School book, p. 282, par. 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> All who meet the requirements are encouraged to enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School. (See Ministry School book, p. 282, par. 6.) The education that this school provides has enabled Jehovah’s people to preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom with conviction, dignity, and love. Jehovah is undoubtedly pleased to be praised by all those who are benefiting so much from theocratic education!—Ps. 148:12, 13; Isa. 50:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Song 89</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: Progressively Teach “Good Things” to Bible Students and Believing Children. (Matt. 12:35a) </span><span class="font10">Discussion. Use the following scriptures to show what we should expect of Bible students and believing children: 1 Corinthians 13: 11; 1 Peter 2:2, 3, footnote. Explain what it means to “taste” the “milk of the word” and how we can help our students and children to do this. Explain the principle at Mark 4:28. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> December 15, 2014, p. 12, pars. 6-8.) Interview an experienced publisher or parent who can explain how he or she helped a Bible student or a child make spiritual progress.—Eph. 4: 13-15; see the May 2014 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: “Share ‘Good Things’ by Being Hospitable (Matt. 12:35a).” </span><span class="font10">Discussion. What benefits or experiences have some had because of showing hospitality? Invite comments about how we can show hospitality to others, especially those in full-time service. Mention local arrangement to provide a meal for each visiting speaker.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Share “Good Things” by Being Hospitable </span><span class="font10">(Matt. 12:35a)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All of us undoubtedly want to share “good things” with others by following “the course of hospitality.” (Rom. 12:13) The elders take the lead in arranging for visiting speakers to receive hospitality and reimbursement for their travel expenses. However, we personally might hesitate to show hospitality because of having limited means, or we might feel anxious about having others come to our home. Our taking to heart Jesus’ counsel to Martha can help us overcome such feelings. (Luke 10:39-42) He emphasized that “the good portion” of hospitality is the fellowship and encouragement, not an elaborate meal or fine home decor. By applying this counsel, we all can share “good things” with our brothers in accord with God’s Word.—3 John 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Theocratic Ministry School Review</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">2. What was the objective of having the kings of Israel make a copy of God’s Law and ‘read from it all the days of their life’? (Deut. 17:18-20) [Nov. 3, w02 6/15 p. 12 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Why is it stated that “you must not plow with a bull and a donkey together,” and how does the command about uneven yoking apply to Christians? (Deut. 22:10) [Nov. 10, w03 10/15 p. 32]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Why was seizing “a hand mill or its upper millstone as security for a loan” prohibited? (Deut. 24:6) [ Nov. 17, w04 9/15 p. 26 par. 3]</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>New Songs for Worship!</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> At the most recent annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, which was held on October 4, 2014, plans were announced to revise our current songbook. That truly was exciting news! All in attendance were reminded of the important place that our Kingdom songs ought to have in our wor-ship.—Ps. 96:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> You may wonder, ‘Why is it necessary to revise the songbook?’ There are several reasons. First of all, our understanding of the Scriptures continues to be refined, and that can affect the lyrics of our songs. (Prov. 4:18) Another reason for the revision: Many expressions and phrases that are used in the current songbook were drawn from the earlier edition of the New World Translation. Those lyrics must now be adjusted to correspond with the wording of the revised edition. Since extensive work would need to be done just to bring the lyrics up-to-date, it was decided to add a few new songs to the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Will we have to wait until a new songbook is printed before we can begin using the new songs? No. We are pleased to inform you that over the next several months, a number of new songs will be released on our Web site, jw.org. When a new song is released, it will be scheduled at the end of a Service Meeting with the notation “new song.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Learn the New Songs: </span><span class="font12">It can be challenging to learn a new song. Still, like the psalmist, we want to sing out at congregation meetings and “not keep silent.” (Ps. 30:12) To learn a new song, follow these simple steps.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">•</span><span class="font11"> Listen repeatedly to the piano recording of the song, which will be posted on our Web site. The more you listen to the melody, the easier it will be for you to remember it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">•</span><span class="font11"> Study the lyrics, and try to memorize them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">•</span><span class="font11"> Sing the melody together with the lyrics. Do so until you have mastered the song.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">•</span><span class="font11"> Rehearse the new songs a few times during your Family Worship session until your family is comfortable with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In future months when a new song is scheduled to conclude the Service Meeting, the congregation will listen once to the piano recording. The audience will then sing the song along with the piano recording, as we do for the other songs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When you think about it, singing at our meetings affords us the joy of unitedly joining our voices in praise to Jehovah. Therefore, we should not get into the habit of leaving our seats unnecessarily when a song is introduced at our Christian meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> There is another way we can show proper appreciation for our sacred music. At assemblies and conventions, a musical interlude is played before each session begins. Twice a year, devoted brothers and sisters from the four corners of the earth travel at their own expense to Patterson, New York, in order to produce beautiful music for use in our worship. Thus, when the chairman invites us to take our seats and listen to what the orchestra has prepared, we should do so. Our doing this will help us to prepare our hearts for the information that will follow.—Ezra 7:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> We will conclude our meeting today with the new song entitled “The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!” This song, which was featured at the recent annual meeting, was specially composed to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> The new songs are certainly “good things” from Jehovah. (Matt. 12:35a) Let us make it our resolve to learn these new songs and sing them from our hearts, giving fitting praise and honor to our God! —Ps. 147:1.</span></p></li></ul>

[Allow for response.] Decades of research indicate that life comes only from preexisting life. This agrees with this simple statement found in the Bible.

<p><span class="font13">“We’re visiting the families on your street to share an encouraging thought from the Bible. Many that we’ve talked to wonder why a loving God would allow so much suffering in the world. Do you think that suffering was part of God’s original purpose for the earth?” Allow for response.

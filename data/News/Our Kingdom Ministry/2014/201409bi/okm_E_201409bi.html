<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Laying the Groundwork for a Return Visit</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Why Important: When we find someone who shows interest, we want to return when he will be home so that we can water the seed of truth that we planted. (1 Cor. 3:6) This of ten requires that before we leave, we lay the groundwork for the return visit by finding out when we may come back. In addition, it is good to leave a question that we will discuss the next time we visit. This will build the householder’s anticipation for the visit, and if the question is answered in the publication we left with him, he will be more likely to read it. Laying the groundwork for the next conversation also makes it easier to call back because the subject for the discussion has already been chosen, and the householder will know what to expect. When we see him again, we can explain that we returned to answer the question that we raised on the last visit and then proceed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How to Do It:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• </span><span class="font7">When preparing your house-to-house presentation, also prepare a follow-up question to be answered on the next visit. It could be based on a topic that is discussed in the literature you are offering that day, or it could be a question that is answered in one of our study publications, which you can introduce when you return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• </span><span class="font7">When concluding your conversation with a person who shows interest, let him know of your desire to talk to him again and then share the follow-up question you prepared. In some territories people are very busy and tend to be reluctant to make an appointment for you to visit them again. In those circumstances, you might say: “Is this usually a good time to find you at home? [Allow for response.] Next week, I’d like to stop by briefly and answer this question . . . If you are too busy when I come, you can just let me know.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font7"> If you tell the householder that you will return at a specific time, keep your appointment. (Matt. 5:37) At the conclusion of the return visit, lay the groundwork for the next one.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font7"> When preparing your presentation, also prepare a follow-up question to answer next time. Share it with other publishers with whom you are working.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">Song 46 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Nahum</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The ruins of ancient Nineveh give evidence that just as Nahum prophesied, Jehovah takes vengeance against His enemies and that even the fiercest of rivals is unable to take a stand against Him. (Nah. 1:2, 6) A closer look at Nahum’s prophecy provides lessons for us in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Offer Comfort and Hope: At first glance, the book of Nahum appears to be only a pro</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">noun</span><span class="font7">cement of doom against Nineveh, the</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. What do we learn from the book of Nahum?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. How can we keep our message positive? </span><span class="font7">proud capital of ancient Assyria. (Nah. 1:1; 3:7) However, this pronouncement came as welcome news to Jehovah’s people. Nahum, whose name means “Comforter,” reassured fellow Jews that their enemy would soon be no more! Nahum further confirmed that Jehovah is “a stronghold in the day of distress.” (Nah. 1:7) As we preach, we too share good news and encourage others to seek refuge in Jehovah.—Nah. 1:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Use Examples and Illustrations: Jehovah inspired Nahum to compare Nineveh’s end to that of the Egyptian city of Thebes (Noamon), which was previously destroyed by Assyria itself. (Nah. 3:8-10) As we speak to individuals about the end of this wicked system of things, we can highlight Bible prophecies that prove that Jehovah fulfills his word down to the very last detail. For example, when the Babylonians and the Medes came against the city of Nineveh in 632 B.C.E., heavy rains caused the Tigris River to overflow, collapsing a portion of the city’s impenetrable walls. Nineveh was then quickly captured, just as Jehovah foretold.—Nah. 1:8; 2:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Be Clear and Understandable: Nahum’s writing style was descriptive and dramatic. His points were clear. (Nah. 1:14; 3:1) Similarly, we want to use language that is easily understood. (1 Cor. 14:9) On the initial call, clearly explain the reason for your visit. As you study the Bible with individuals, help them to develop faith in Jehovah and his Word and to appreciate how the information applies to them personally.—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Nahum’s trust in the undeniable fulfillment of Jehovah’s word shines through clearly in the Bible book bearing his name. As the end of Satan’s system approaches, we find comfort in the divine decree: “Distress will not arise a second time.”—Nah. 1:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">3. How can we imitate Nahum in using examples or illustrations?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. How can we be clear and understandable in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. What assurance do we find in Nahum’s prophecy?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A traveling overseer has downloaded the video Why Study the Bible? to his phone and shows it every chance he gets. For example, when going from house to house, he says: “I’m making brief visits to help people find answers to three important questions: Why does the world have so many problems? How will God fix them? And how can we cope in the meantime? This short video addresses those questions.” He then presses the play button and watches the householder’s reaction. The video is so captivating that most people do not take their eyes off the screen until the end. Then the traveling overseer says: “You just heard that you can request a Bible study online. Since I’m here, I could give you a quick demonstration now.” If the householder agrees, he demonstrates the study using the Good News brochure. If the householder does not have time, he makes arrangements to do so on the next visit. When he goes to a coffee shop to take a break, he says something similar to someone sitting nearby after striking up a friendly conversation. Are you using jw.org in your ministry?</span></p>

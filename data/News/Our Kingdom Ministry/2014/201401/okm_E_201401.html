<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Micah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> ‘When will the end of this corrupt system of things finally come?’ The prophet Micah may have pondered a similar question as he proclaimed Jehovah’s judgment messages against the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Yet, his preaching was not in vain. In 740 B.C.E., </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">durin</span><span class="font10">g Micah’s lifetime, Jehovah’ s words</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What question may Micah have pondered, but why was his preaching not in vain? against Samaria were fulfilled. (Mic. 1:6, 7) Later, Jerusalem was destroyed in the year 607 B.C.E. (Mic. 3:12) How can we imitate Micah as we await the execution of Jehovah’s judgments in our day?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Be Patient: Micah wrote: “As for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah. I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.” (Mic. 7:7) Of course, Micah did not idly wait for the end to come. He remained busy as Jehovah’s prophet. As we await Jehovah’s day, we should also be engaged in “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.” (2 Pet. 3:11, 12) Jehovah’s patience allows individuals time to repent. (2 Pet. 3:9) Therefore, we take to heart the divine admonition to imitate the prophets in exercising patience.—Jas. 5:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Rely on Jehovah’s Strength: Although Micah had a challenging assignment, he looked to Jehovah for the strength to carry it out. (Mic. 3:8) It is no coincidence that Jehovah’s Word urges us to rely on God for strength. He generously gives power to the tired ones so that they can fulfill their theocratic responsibilities. (Ps. 84:5, 7; Isa. 40:2831) Have you personally experienced this in your life of sacred service? Do you regularly petition Jehovah for the help of his powerful holy spirit?—Luke 11:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Throughout his life, Micah made the doing of God’s will his priority. He was determined to remain faithful although surrounded by moral corruption. Similarly, our integrity is tested on a daily basis. Let us therefore strengthen our resolve to “walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.” —Mic. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How and why do we show patience as we await Jehovah’s day?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be More Than a Silent Partner</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul viewed the time he spent with fellow believers as opportunities for “an interchange of encouragement.” (Rom. 1:12) When you work with another publisher in the ministr y, do you take advantage of this time to encourage and assist </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him?</span><span class="font10"> Instead of being a silent partner, why</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">1. How may we imitate the apostle Paul’s attitude when we are working with others in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">not share what helps you to be an effective publisher?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Instill Confidence: Some publishers lack confidence, which may be reflected in their facial expressions or tone of voice. We can bolster their confidence by giving them sincere commendation. What are some other ways to instill confidence? One traveling overseer freely tells his partner about his own fears and how he prays often for help to overcome such feelings. Another brother noted this regarding what helps him reflect confidence: “It starts with a smile. Sometimes I have to pray for help to make that simple expression.” Has something helped you to be more confident in the ministry? Share it with your field service partner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Share Methods: Have you found a simple opening statement or question, perhaps something about a local event, to be effective in starting a conversation? Have you experienced good results from adding a personal touch to a sample presentation? Tell your partner. (Prov. 27:17) While traveling to a return visit, you can relate your objective for the visit and how you plan to achieve it. After a Bible study, you could explain why you chose a certain point, scripture, or teaching method to address the student’s needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> First-century evangelizers were not just interested in helping unbelievers. They also saw the value of encouraging and strengthening one another. (Acts 11:23; 15:32) The apostle Paul trained young Timothy and then encouraged him to share what he had learned with others. (2 Tim. 2:2) When we do not forget to do good to fellow Christians while in the ministry, we not only increase their joy and effectiveness but we also please </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">our h</span><span class="font10">eavenly Father.—Heb. 13:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Magazine Routes—Useful for Starting Bible Studies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many people are not inclined to study the Bible with us, but they enjoy reading our magazines. Therefore, Jehovah’s organization has long encouraged publishers to develop a magazine route. As people regularly read our magazines, they often form a longing for God’s Word. (1 Pet. 2:2) Eventu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ally, </span><span class="font10">something they read could strike a re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">1. Why has Jehovah’s organization long encouraged publishers to develop a magazine route? sponsive chord, causing them to accept a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Water’ Seeds of Truth: </span><span class="font10">Rather than simply dropping the magazines off, engage the householder in conversation and try to build a rapport with him. This will help you to learn his circumstances, interests, and beliefs, which will enable you to speak with insight. (Prov. 16:23) Prepare for each visit. If possible, briefly highlight a point and related scripture from the magazines, watering any seeds of truth in his heart. (1 Cor. 3:6) Make a record of the date of each visit, the literature that was left, and the subjects and scriptures that were discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Return How Often? </span><span class="font10">You should return once a month to bring the latest magazines to those on your route. However, depending on your circumstances and the interest of the individual, you may choose to visit more often. For example, a week or two after leaving the magazines, you could return and say, “I stopped by briefly to point out something from the magazines I left you.” This will whet the person’s appetite to read a particular article. If he has already read it, you could ask him what he thought about the article and discuss it briefly. Or if the individual enjoys reading our literature, you might return and offer him the tract, brochure, or book that we are featuring that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Do not wait for the householder to ask you for a study. Take the initiative. Even if he has refused a Bible study in the past, from time to time you can feature “Bible Questions Answered” from The Watchtower and see if he is willing to discuss it with you. Perhaps you can start a doorstep study. However, if you are unable to start a study, you can continue bringing him the magazines to cultivate his interest.</span></p>

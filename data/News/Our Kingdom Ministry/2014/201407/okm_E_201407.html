<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Initiating a Conversation in Order to Witness Informally</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Why I m portant: When sharing in the house-to-house ministry, we often find that many people are not at home. However, we may come in contact with them when using public transportation, when waiting in a doctor’s office, when taking a break at work or at school, and so forth. It is Jehovah’s will that everyone has an opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Often, in order to give a witness, we must take the initiative to start a conversation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How to Do It:</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Be selective. Does the person seem friendly and willing to talk? Do the circumstances allow for relaxed conversation? Some publishers first make eye contact with the person and then smile. If the person smiles back, they try to start a conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Say a brief, silent prayer if you lack the courage to speak.—Neh. 2:4; Acts 4:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Start with a simple comment, perhaps a greeting. Jesus did not begin his conversation with the Samaritan woman by talking about the Kingdom. (John 4:7) Sometimes a conversation can be initiated by giving commendation: “Your children are so well-behaved!” Asking a question is another possible conversation starter: “Did you see that news report last night?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Once the conversation has started, look for an opportunity to introduce the good news, but do not be in a hurry. Allow the conversation to develop naturally. Perhaps you can make a statement that arouses the person’s curiosity and prompts an inquiry. For example, if the conversation is about family matters, you might say, “I found some </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">reliable</span><span class="font8"> advice on raising children.” If you are discussing a news item, you could say, “I recently enjoyed reading some </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font8"> news for a change.” Do not be discouraged if the conversation ends before you can give a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Carry tracts or other literature that you can give to someone who shows interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font8"> Each weektryto start at least one conversation with the goal of witnessing informally.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Song 65 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark13"></a>How Do I Appear to Jehovah?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> How often do you look into a mirror? Most of us do so daily because this helps us see aspects of our physical appearance that need attention. The Bible has been likened to a mirror. Reading God’s Word enables us to see our inner self, the person whom Jehovah sees. (1 Sam. 16:7; Jas. 1:22-24) God’s Word can “discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) How can reading </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">and </span><span class="font8">meditating on the Bible every day help</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. How is the Bible like a mirror? us to see areas that we should strengthen in order to be more successful evangelizers? —Ps. 1:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Use the Bible as a Mirror: Bible accounts of faithful servants of Jehovah teach us what qualities are beautiful to him. For example, David demonstrated zeal for God’s name. (1 Sam. 17:45, 46) Isaiah courageously volunteered to preach in difficult territory. (Isa. 6:8, 9) Jesus’ deep love for his heavenly Father caused him to view the ministry as a source of refreshment and satisfaction rather than an unpleasant burden. (John 4:34) First-century Christians preached with zeal, relied on Jehovah, and were determined not to give up. (Acts 5:41, 42; 2 Cor. 4:1; 2 Tim. 4:17) Meditating on such examples helps us to look at ourselves with the objective of improving the quality of our sacred service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Act to Correct Defects: Of course, it does us no good to look in a mirror and then ignore a defect. We can ask Jehovah to help us see ourselves objectively and then to help us make needed adjustments. (Ps. 139:23, 24; Luke 11:13) Because the time left is reduced and lives are involved, we must not procrastinate about making necessary chang-es.—1 Cor. 7:29; 1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> A person’s inner self—what Jehovah takes note of—is far more important than his outward appearance. (1 Pet. 3:3, 4) What happens to the man who peers into God’s Word and then acts on what he discovers? He “has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.” (Jas. 1:25) Yes, we will be happy and effective ministers because we “reflect like mir</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">rors t</span><span class="font8">he glory of Jehovah.”—2 Cor. 3:18.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">Song 70 and Prayer</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Zephaniah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It was the mid-seventh century B.C.E., and Baal worship was being openly practiced in Judah. Bad King Amon had recently been murdered, and now young King Josiah was reigning. (2 Chron. 33:21-34:1) During that time, Jehovah raised up Zephaniah to declare His judgment message. Although Zephaniah may have been a member of Judah’s royal house, he did not water down Jehovah’s message of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1. In what setting did Zephaniah serve as a prophet, and how is he a good example for us today? </span><span class="font8">condemnation to Judah’s leadership. (Zeph. 1:1; 3:1-4) Similarly, we strive to imitate Zephaniah’s courage and avoid allowing family ties to impact our worship of Jehovah in a negative way. (Matt. 10:34-37) What message did Zephaniah declare, and with what results?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Seek Jehovah: Only Jehovah can save individuals in the day of his anger. Thus, Zephaniah urged the people of Judah to seek Jehovah, seek righteousness, and seek meekness while time still remained. (Zeph. 2:2, 3) The same is true in our day. Like Zephaniah, we encourage others to seek Jehovah, but we too must act, being determined never to “turn away from following Jehovah.” (Zeph. 1:6) Rather, we seek Jehovah by carefully studying his Word and by praying for his guidance. We seek righteousness by living a morally clean life. We seek meekness by cultivating a submissive attitude and by readily responding to direction from Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Positive Results: Zephaniah’s judgment message struck a responsive chord with at least some in Judah but likely most notably with young Josiah, who started to search for Jehovah while he was still a boy. Josiah later carried out a vigorous campaign against idolatry in the land. (2 Chron. 34:2-5) Today, although some Kingdom seed falls alongside the ro ad, on ro cky ground, or among the thorns, some also falls on the fine soil and yields fruit. (Matt. 13:18-23) We are confident that Jehovah will continue to bless our efforts as we stay busy spreading Kingdom seed.—Ps. 126:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Some in Judah felt that Jehovah would never act. However, Jehovah assured all that his great day was near. (Zeph. 1:12, 14) Salvation would come only to those who took refuge in him. (Zeph. 3:12, 17) As we ‘keep ourselves in expectation of Jehovah,’ may we find delight in serving unitedly with fellow worshippers of our great God!—Zeph. 3:8, 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">2. What action must we take to be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Preparing Our Opening Words</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Why Important: </span><span class="font8">If our introduction does not arouse interest, the householder may terminate the conversation before we can give a witness. Therefore, many publishers consider their opening words to be the most important part of their presentation. Although sample presentations are provided in Our Kingdom Ministry and the Reasoning book, they do not always include a complete introduction, in order to allow for flexibility. Even if a sample presentation is complete, publishers may choose to alter it or prepare their own. Thus, we will be more effective if we carefully prepare our opening words rather than say whatever comes to mind when the householder opens the door. —Prov. 15:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How to Do It:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Choose your topic. It should be based on the literature you are offering and should be of interest to people in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Carefully prepare the first sentence or two that you will say after giving a customary greeting. You might start by saying: “I am here because . . . ,” “Many people are concerned about . . . ,” “I would like to get your opinion on . . . ,” or something else. Short, simple sentences usually work best. Some publishers choose to memorize their introduction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Formulate a viewpoint question that will draw the householder into the conversation. (Matt. 17:25) Remember that he was likely thinking about other matters before you arrived, so the question should not be too difficult or put him on the spot.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> Set aside time during family worship to prepare and practice your opening words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">•</span><span class="font8"> When in the ministry, share what you plan to say with other publishers. (Prov. 27:17) Change your introduction if it is not effective.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Cultivate the Habit of</span><br><br><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Being Punctual</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is always on time. For instance, he gives his servants ‘help at the right time.’ (Heb. 4:16) He also dispenses spiritual “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24: 45) We can therefore be confident that the coming day of his anger “will not be late.” (Hab. 2:3) How we benefit from Jehovah’s</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. What example does Jehovah set regarding punctuality?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">punctuality! (Ps. 70:5) As busy, imperfect humans, however, being on time can be a real challenge for us. Why should we cultivate the habit of being punctual?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Punctuality has become the exception during these last days when many people are lovers of themselves and without self-control. (2 Tim. 3:1-3) So when Christians are punctual for work, appointments, and meetings, others take notice, and this brings honor to Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:12) Do we usually begin secular work on time but find that we are often late for theocratic events? Being on time for Christian meetings, including the opening song and prayer, demonstrates a desire to imitate our orderly heavenly Father.—1 Cor. 14:33, 40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Being punctual also shows consideration for others. (Phil. 2:3, 4) For example, when we are on time for Christian meetings, including meetings for field service, fellow worshippers are not unduly disturbed. On the other hand, if we are habitually late, it gives others the impression that we consider our time to be more valuable than theirs. Punctuality demonstrates reliability, diligence, and trustworthiness —qualities appreciated by those around us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> If you are often late, meditate on the reasons why. Organize yourself by making a realistic schedule that enables you to accomplish tasks at their appointed time. (Eccl. 3:1; Phil. 1:10) Ask Jehovah for help. (1 John 5:14) Being punctual is one way of showing appreciation for the two greatest commandments of the Law—to love God </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">and t</span><span class="font8">o love our neighbor.—Matt. 22:37-39.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What must children learn in order to growto spiritual maturity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christian parents do much to bring their children up “in the discipline and instruction of Jehovah.” (Eph. 6:4; ftn.) For example, parents have found it beneficial to consider the daily text with their children each morning. During family worship and on other occasions, families may watch and discuss a video together, talk about specific material from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font7"> articles, reenact a Bible account, or have practice sessions. However, in order for children to “press on to maturity,” they must also be taught deeper Bible truths.—Heb. 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Consider what we teach those we meet in our territory. On the initial call or on a subsequent visit, we generally endeavor to start a Bible study using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font7"> After completing that publication, we use </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.”</span><span class="font7"> Why? The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font7"> book gives students a basic knowledge of the Scriptures. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“God’s Love”</span><span class="font7"> book teaches them how to apply Bible principles in everyday life. Consideration of both publications helps new ones to become “rooted” in Christ and “stabilized in the faith.” (Col. 2:6, 7) Would this material not also benefit our children? They too need to be taught about the ransom, the Kingdom, and the condition of the dead. Children also need to know why God permits suffering and how to identify the last days of this system of things. They must be convinced that Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth. Young ones also need to understand Bible principles and how to train “their powers of discernment.” (Heb. 5:14) Of course, parents must consider the age and comprehension level of their children. However, many children have the ability to begin learning deeper Bible truths even when they are quite young.—Luke 2:42, 46, 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To help parents, study guides that are based on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font7"> book will appear on jw.org. Families can find these on our Web site by looking under BIBLE TEACHINGS </span><span class="font9">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">TEENAGERS. In the future, additional study guides will be prepared based on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“God’s Love”</span><span class="font7"> book. Of course, the printed version of these books can also be used. Parents can determine whether they will use this material during a portion of their Family Worship evening, when conducting a separate study with one of their children, or when training a child to do his own personal study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In 1922, J.F. Rutherford boldly proclaimed: “Behold, the King reigns! . . . Advertise, the King and his kingdom.” In this 100th year of Kingdom rule, his exclamation still fills us with excitement. Let us exert ourselves to make this August a historic month by helping others to learn about the Kingdom through our Web site!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Use the New Web Site Tract</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tract is entitled Where Can We Find Answers to Life’s Big Questions? Three questions are raised on the back of the tract. When an opportunity arises, ask a person which question interests him the most and direct him to BIBLE TEACHINGS </span><span class="font8">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED on the Web site to find the answer.

<p><span class="font8">Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Confidently Speaking Up About the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why Important: If we are to follow the clear direction given at 2 Timothy 1:7, 8, it is important that we confidently speak up about the Kingdom. How can we gain confidence to advertise the Kingdom?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">A Century of Advertising the Kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> “Behold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom.” With those stirring words spoken by Brother Rutherford nearly a century ago, Jehovah’s people were encouraged to broadcast the Kingdom message far and wide. And that is what we have done! Like the early Christians, we have preached the good news of the Kingdom “in all creation under heaven.” (Col. 1:23) Looking back over the last century, what have we </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">done</span><span class="font6"> to advertise God’s Kingdom? How can</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. What were Jehovah’s people encouraged to do nearly a century ago?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">we continue to advertise it as we approach the 100th anniversary of the Kingdom’s birth?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Looking Back: For decades, our literature has promoted God’s Kingdom. Since 1939 our principal magazine has had as its title: The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. This magazine frequently discusses the Kingdom and what it will accomplish. The Awake! magazine also highlights God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. How fitting that these two magazines are now the most widely translated and distributed magazines in the world!—Rev. 14:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah’s people have employed various methods to advertise the Kingdom. In the early days, we made use of sound cars, radio broadcasts, and portable phonographs. Those methods helped us to spread the good news to a wide audience at a time when there were relatively few Kingdom proclaimers. (Ps. 19:4) In recent years, we have published information on jw.org, thus proclaiming the Kingdom to millions—including those who live in lands where our work is restricted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s people have also engaged in special initiatives to spread the Kingdom message. For example, beginning in the mid-1990’s, we made an effort to augment our house-to-house work by witnessing in public parks, in car parks, at ports, and at businesses. Recently, we have organized special metropolitan public witnessing in large cities around the world. In addition, many congregations are participating in public witnessing in their local territory by using literature carts and tables that are set up near high-traffic areas. Of course, we keep the house-to-house work as the mainstay of our Kingdom-preaching activity.—Acts 20:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Looking Ahead: With the start of the new service year in September, many will begin </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">servi</span><span class="font6">ng as regular pioneers. Could you join</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Review</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning August 25, 2014.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. How can Leviticus 18:3 help us to avoid developing a twisted sense of right and wrong? (Eph. 4:17-19) [ July 7, w02 2/1 p. 29 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. What does the command at Leviticus 19:2 teach us, and why should we strive to obey it? [ July 7, w09 7/1 p. 9 par. 5] the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Kingdom. Fittingly, the public edition of The Watchtower that month focuses on God’s Kingdom. Why not make an effort to get this issue into the hands of as many as possible? As we look to the future, may each of us continue “declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God” to all who will listen.—Acts 8:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. What does the principle behind the ancient law on gleaning teach us today? (Lev. 19:9, 10) [July 7, w06 6/15 pp. 2223 par. 13]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. Why can it be said that the law of “eye for eye” did not promote personal revenge? (Lev. 24:19, 20) [July 14, w09 9/1 p. 22 pars. 3-4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. Under what circumstances would it be wrong for an Israelite to charge interest on a loan, but when would the charging of interest be allowed? (Lev. 25:3537) [July 21, w04 5/15 p. 24 par. 3]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">6. Why is reference generally made to the 12 tribes of Israel when there were actually 13? (Num. 1:49, 50) [July 28, w08 7/1 p. 21]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">7. What lesson regarding showing consideration to older ones can we glean from the account about Levite compulsory service recorded at Numbers 8:25, 26? [Aug. 11, w04 8/1 p. 25 par. 1]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">8. After their miraculous exodus from Egypt, why did the Israelites develop a complaining spirit, and what vital lesson can we learn from this account? (Num. 11:4-6) [Aug. 18, w95 3/1 pp. 1516 par. 10]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">9. What can we learn from the way that Moses responded when Eldad and Medad began acting as prophets? (Num. 11:2729) [Aug. 18, w04 8/1 p. 26 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">10. What valuable principle can we learn from the command given to the Israelites to “make for themselves fringed edges on the skirts of their garments”? (Num. 15:37-39) [Aug. 25, w04 8/1 p. 26 par. 7]</span></p></li></ul>

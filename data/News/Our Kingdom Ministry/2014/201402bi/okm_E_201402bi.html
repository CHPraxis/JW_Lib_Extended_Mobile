<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry —Making a Record of the Interest</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">“Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:16) This inspired counsel from the apostle Paul to Timothy indicates that, whether we are new or experienced, we should endeavor to make progress. To help us do that, a new series entitled “Improving Our Skills in the Ministry” will appear in Our Kingdom Ministry. Each article will discuss an important skill and provide some suggestions on how to develop it. During the month, all are encouraged to give that skill special attention. After the month concludes, a Service Meeting part will give us an opportunity to comment on how we benefited from concentrating on that skill. This month we are encouraged to work on making a record of the interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Important: </span><span class="font10">To fulfill our commission, we must do more than preach. We must return to those who show interest and teach them, watering the seeds of truth that we have planted. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Cor. 3: 6-9) This requires finding the person again, talking about his concerns, and building on our previous conversation. Therefore, when we find interest, it is necessary to make a record of it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How to Do It:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> Make sure that you have tools in your witnessing case for recording interest. Keep your records neat, well-organized, and up-to-date. Make a record as soon as you finish the call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> Write down information about the householder. What is his name and contact information, such as his address, phone number, or e-mail address? What did you observe about him and his family that may be significant?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> Write down the details of your conversation. What scriptures did you read? What did he say about his beliefs? What literature did you leave? Record the time, the day of the week, and the date of the visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> Write down what you plan to do next time. What did you promise to discuss? When did you say you would return?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> Update your record each time you return. No harm is done if you write down more information than you need. Ensure you always keep your records secure.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font9"> When making a record, tell those with whom you are working what you are writing down.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Make This Memorial Season a Joyful One!</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Would you like to increase your joy during March, April, and May? One way to do that is to expand your ministry and, if possible, auxiliary pioneer. How will this add to your joy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Increase Your Joy: Jehovah created us </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font9"> the capacity to experience joy and satis-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">1. What is one way to increase our joy during this Memorial season?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">2. How will expanding our ministry result in increased joy?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">faction from worshipping him as we fulfill our inborn spiritual need. (Matt. 5:3) He also designed us in such a way that we can gain happiness from giving to others. (Acts 20:35) The ministry allows us to do both—to worship God and to help people. It stands to reason that having an increased share in the ministry results in even greater joy. In addition, the more we preach, the more skillful we may become. As we gain skill, we build our confidence and minimize our nervousness. We will have more opportunities to give a witness and to start Bible studies. All of this makes the ministry more enjoyable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> March and April will be especially good months to auxiliary pioneer because we can choose either a 30- or a 50-hour requirement. In addition, beginning Saturday, March 22, and continuing until the Memorial on Monday, April 14, we will participate in an enjoyable campaign to invite others to attend the Memorial. Congregations will be abuzz with excitement, as many will be working “shoulder to shoulder” to cover as much of the territory as possible in the allotted time.—Zeph. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Prepare Now: If you have not already done so, take time to review your schedule and see what adjustments you can make to expand your ministry during one or more months. Make it a matter of prayer. (Jas. 1:5) Talk about it with your family and others in the congregation. (Prov. 15:22) You may find that despite health challenges or a full work schedule, you too can experience the joy that comes from auxiliary pioneering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah wants his servants to be joyful. (Ps. 32:11) By exerting ourselves to expand our ministry this Memorial season, not only will it increase our joy but it will also bring joy to our </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">heave</span><span class="font9">nly Father.—Prov. 23:24; 27:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Memorial Invitation Campaign Starts March 22</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">This year our campaign to invite others to attend the Memorial begins on Saturday, March 22. All are encouraged to have a full share. On the weekends we will also offer the current magazines when appropriate. On the first Saturday in April, we will focus on distributing invitations rather than on starting Bible studies. However, if we encounter someone who shows special interest, we may still try to start a Bible study. The service overseer can determine whether distributing invitations through public witnessing will help the congregation to reach more people in its territory. Make a list now of relatives, workmates, schoolmates, return visits, and other acquaintances whom you wish to invite, and give them an invitation when the campaign begins. We hope that many will join us as we commemorate the two greatest expressions of love.—John 3:16; 15:13.</span></p>

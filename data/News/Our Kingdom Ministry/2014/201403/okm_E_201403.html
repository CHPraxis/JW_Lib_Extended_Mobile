<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Responding to Potential Conversation Stoppers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Why Important: Imagine that you know that a natural disaster is imminent. People will die unless they flee to safety. You go to a neighbor’s home to warn him, but he interrupts you, saying that he is busy. Surely, you would not quickly abandon your efforts to help him! Many in our territory turn us away, not realizing the life-saving value of our message. At the time of our visit, perhaps they are preoccupied. (Matt. 24:37-39) Or maybe they have been prejudiced by untrue rumors. (Matt. 11:18, 19) They might assume that we are no different from the religions that have produced bad fruitage. (2 Pet. 2:1, 2) If the householder initially is not interested, we should not be quick to give up.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>How to Do It:</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> Before preaching from house to house, take a few moments to think about potential conversation stoppers that you may encounter and consider how to respond.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> If the householder presents an objection, gently try to continue the conversation. Perhaps you can do that by commending him. For example, if he says that he has his own religion, you might reply, “I was hoping to find someone like you who has an interest in spiritual things.” Sometimes acknowledging the householder’s feelings or circumstances will enable you to continue giving a witness. For instance, if he says that he is busy, you might say: “I understand. But before I leave, I would like to give you this.” Another option is to ask a question if the householder says that he is not interested. You could say, “Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or is it religion in general that does not interest you?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> Use good judgment. Remember that Jehovah does not force people to listen. (Deut. 30:19) Everyone must carry his own load of spiritual responsibility. (Gal. 6:5) If the householder is adamant, it is best to take our leave. By demonstrating respect for his feelings, we may open the door for another publisher to give a witness in the future. —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Try This During the Month:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> When you encounter a potential conversation stopper, after leaving the householder, discuss with your partner how you might have responded in a better way.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">Song 8 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Will You Seize the Opportunity? </span><span class="font9">Upcoming Memorial Enables Us to Show Gratitude</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial on April 14 presents a unique opportunity to cultivate and demonstrate gratitude for Jehovah’s goodness. The account at Luke 17:11-18 indicates how Jehovah and Jesus view gratitude. Sadly, only one of the ten cured lepers seized the opportunity to express thanks. In the future, the gift of the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ranso</span><span class="font9">m will bring about a complete healing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1. What special opportunity does the Memorial present?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">of all maladies, making everlasting life a reality! No doubt, we will then thank Jehovah daily for such blessings. But how can we show our gratitude during the coming weeks?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Cultivate Gratitude: Feelings of gratitude are generated by thoughts. To help us build our appreciation for the ransom, a schedule for the special Memorial Bible reading can be found in a number of places, such as in appendix B12 of the revised New World Translation, the calendar, and Examining the Scriptures Daily. Why not consider this information as a family? Doing so will heighten our appreciation for the ransom. This, in turn, will have a positive effect on our con-duct.—2 Cor. 5:14, 15; 1 John 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Demonstrate Gratitude: Gratitude is proved by action. (Col. 3:15) The grateful leper made the effort to find Jesus and thank him. Doubtless, he also spoke enthusiastically about his miraculous healing to others. (Luke 6:45) Will gratitude for the ransom move us to share zealously in the campaign to publicize the Memorial? Auxiliary pioneering or increasing our share in the ministry during the Memorial season is another fine way to demonstrate thankfulness. On the evening of the Memorial, an appreciative heart will motivate us to welcome visitors and to make ourselves available to answer their questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Will this Memorial be our last? (1 Cor. 11: 26) We do not know. But we do know that once it passes, gone will be a unique opportunity to show gratitude. Will you seize it? May the appreciative words of our mouth and the meditation of our heart bring pleasure to Jehovah, the generous Provider of the ransom. —Ps. 19:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">2. How may we cultivate gratitude for the ransom?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. In what ways can we demonstrate our gratitude during the Memorial season?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. How can we make this Memorial one without regrets?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Since older magazines do not benefit anyone when they are stored or thrown away, we should try to place them. A single magazine can spark a person’s interest in the truth and move him to begin calling on the name of Jehovah. (Rom. 10:13, 14) The following are some suggestions for putting older magazines to good use.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> When preaching in territories that are not worked frequently, perhaps you can leave one out of sight at not-at-homes.</span></p></li>
<li>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Being a Helpful Companion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Important: </span><span class="font8">Jesus recognized the value of preaching with a companion. So when he dispatched 70 of his disciples to go ahead of him and preach, he sent them out in pairs. (Luke 10:1) A companion can provide needed support if his fellow publisher encounters a difficult situation or is unsure of how to answer a householder. (Eccl. 4:9, 10) He can share his experience and occasionally offer a suggestion that may help the one with whom he is working become a more effective evange-lizer. (Prov. 27:17) He can also encourage by means of his upbuilding conversation between doors.—Phil. 4:8.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Do It:</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font8"> Pay attention when your partner is giving a witness. (Jas. 1:19) When a scripture is read, follow along in your copy of the Bible. This will put you in a better position to assist if needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font8"> Use good judgment to determine if and when you should join in the conversation. (Prov. 25:11) If you accompany another publisher on a Bible study, your occasional comments will likely be appreciated. However, when preaching from house to house, your service companion may prefer that you let him do the talking when it is his turn. Of course, if he is a new publisher or if he is not sure how to respond to a question or objection, he will likely appreciate your help. But whether you are accompanying a publisher in the house-to-house, return visit, or Bible study work, do not interrupt, take over the conversation, or introduce a different subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font8"> Share your experience. If, on occasion, you can give the publisher with whom you are working a suggestion to help him be more effective in the ministry, do not hold back. (Prov. 3:27) At an appropriate time, you might begin by saying: “How do you think that went?” or “May I offer a suggestion?” or “Here’s what I try to do.” Keep in mind that while others appreciate receiving a suggestion </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">on occasion,</span><span class="font8"> they will be discouraged if every mistake is called to their attention.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">•</span><span class="font8"> After working in the ministry with your field service partner, tell him what he said or did that made him a helpful companion.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Congregate the People”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Shortly af ter leaving Egypt, Jehovah instructed Moses to “congregate the people” at Mount Sinai to hear His words so that they might fear Him and instruct their sons in His ways. (Deut. 4:10-13) What a memorable and faith-strengthening occasion that must have been! During the next few months, Jehovah’s people will gather at district and international conventions to be instructed by Jehovah. What must we do in order to benefit to the full?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Be Ready”: </span><span class="font8">Jehovah commanded the Israelites to “be ready” for that historic gathering at Mount Sinai. (Ex. 19:10, 11) Likewise, careful preparation is needed by all who will attend the conventions, not just by those who will have a part on the programme. For example, many will need to arrange to take time off from their secular job. Perhaps your situation is similar to Nehemiah’s. He wanted to leave his work as King Artaxerxes’ cupbearer in order</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. District and international conventions have what similarities to a momentous gathering of the Israelites shortly after they left Egypt?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">2. What must we do to “be ready” for our convention?</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>2014 Convention Reminders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Programme Times: </span><span class="font8">The doors to the building will open at 8:00 a.m. The introductory music will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. At that time, all of us should go to our seats so that the programme can begin in a dignified manner. The closing song and prayer will be introduced at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:50 p.m. on Sunday. </span><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">International Convention: </span><span class="font8">London Twickenham will host the international convention. Keep in mind that the branch office has invited specific congregations and foreign delegates after carefully calculating the number of seats, parking spaces, and hotel rooms available. Overcrowding may occur if publishers attend the international convention in London to which they have not been invited. Conventions held on the same weekend as the international convention will be linked by video for key talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Parking: </span><span class="font8">The increased use of coaches has helped considerably to ease parking problems. (If applicable, the elders will provide further information regarding coaches.) We appreciate your continued cooperation. At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities the spaces will be available through the congregations at no charge. Parking is often limited, so carsharing should be done to the extent possible. When it comes to the distribution of parking tickets, every effort will be made to ensure that the disabled and infirm are given priority. Congregation Service Committees</span></p>

Nehemiah said a prayer and then courageously presented his graciously worded request. The king allowed him to leave and even gave support to the building project! (Neh. 2: 1-9) In addition to requesting time off from your employer, have you confirmed your travel arrangements and accommodation? The elders will be happy to help any who may need assistance. Plan to arrive early for each session, and be ready to “pay more than the usual attention” to what you will hear.—Heb. 2:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Another important facet of our readiness involves preparing our heart so that we may listen and learn. (Ezra 7:10) The convention programme will be posted in advance on the jw.org website and will list the titles for all the talks along with one or two key scriptures for each one. This provides excellent material to consider during our Family Worship evening in the weeks leading up to our assigned convention. Some publishers print out the programme and use it for taking brief notes during the convention.</span></p></li></ul>

If your circumstances change and you no longer need a parking ticket, please return the ticket so that another car party may use it. At some of the new indoor city centre venues, parking will only be available in commercial car parks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Seat Saving: </span><span class="font8">When the doors to the facility are opened each morning, please do not rush to the seating area of your preference as if competing with fellow attend-ers. A self-sacrificing spirit that moves us to seek the good of others identifies us as true Christians and moves onlookers to praise God. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5; 1 Pet. 2:12) Seats may be saved only for those living in your home or travelling in your vehicle or for your current Bible students. Special seating has been provided for the elderly and the infirm. Since this seating is limited, only one or two persons directly assisting</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> ‘Teach Your Sons’: </span><span class="font8">One of the stated purposes of the convention at Mount Sinai was for Israelite parents to “teach their sons.” (Deut. 4: 10) The convention gives parents an excellent opportunity to do the same. Parents should have their children sit with them during the sessions and help them pay attention. At the end of each day and later during their family worship, families can discuss the programme together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The momentous convention at Mount Sinai helped the Israelites to appreciate their unique privilege of being God’s people. (Deut. 4:7, 8) Our upcoming convention is designed to benefit us in a similar way. For three days we will be able to step out of the harsh wilderness of Satan’s world and enjoy spiritual refreshment and upbuilding association in our spiritual paradise. (Isa. 35:7-9) With Jehovah’s day drawing near, may we not forsake this opportunity to meet together for an interchange of en-couragement!—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Meal: </span><span class="font8">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Donations: </span><span class="font8">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any cheques should be made payable to “International Bible Students Association” in Britain and “Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Ireland” in Ireland. Donations can also be made by debit or credit card.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> If you were planning a special meal for friends or family, one that required much effort and expense to prepare, you would likely be enthusiastic when extending invitations. Similarly, much work has gone into preparing the spiritual feast that will be presented at our 2014 district and international conventions. Beginning three weeks before the start of our convention, we will have the privilege of inviting others to attend. What will help us to extend the invitations with enthusiasm?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We will be moved to have a full share in the campaign if we reflect appreciatively on how much we personally benefit from the spiritual banquet that Jehovah provides at our conventions.

<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Safety Precautions: </span><span class="font8">Please be especially mindful of preventing potential injuries that can be caused by slipping and tripping. Each year injuries occur that are related to footwear, especially high-heeled shoes. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow you to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font8">The programme will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency, if available. To hear it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Fragrances: </span><span class="font8">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, co-the campaign will bring praise to Jehovah and reflect his generosity.—Ps. 145:3, 7; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Each body of elders should determine how the congregation can give the invitations wide distribution, including whether to leave them at not-at-homes or offer them in public witnessing within the territory. On weekends the magazines should be offered along with the invitation when appropriate. If the first Saturday of the month falls within the dates of the campaign, emphasis should be placed on distributing invitations rather than on starting Bible studies. After the campaign concludes, how happy we will be to know that we participated enthusiastically and that we invited as many people as possible to join us at the spir</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">itual </span><span class="font8">banquet that Jehovah provided!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> We attract the attention of the public during our conventions each year, so it is important that by our conduct we properly represent the God we worship. (Lev. 20:26) Our good manners as well as our dress and grooming should clearly identify us as Christ’s true followers. As we attend the upcoming district or international conventions, how can we ‘maintain our conduct fine among the nations’ and thus give glory to our heavenly Father?—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Parents should closely supervise their children at the convention site, in restaurants, and at the hotel.

<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Theocratic Ministry School Review</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning April 28, 2014.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. What enabled Joseph to flee from committing immorality with Potiphar’s wife? (Gen. 39:7-12) [Mar. 3, w13 2/15 p. 4 par. 6; w07 10/15 p. 23 par. 16]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. How is Joseph a good example for those who face injustice and adversities? (Gen. 41:14, 39, 40) [Mar. 10, w04 1/15 p. 29 par. 6; w04 6/1 p. 20 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. What basis was there for Joseph to extend mercy to his brothers? [Mar. 17, w99 1/1 p. 30 pars. 6-7]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. How did the tribe of Benjamin eventually fulfill the prophecy at Genesis 49:27? [Mar. 24, w12 1/1 p. 29, box]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5. What does Exodus 3:7-10 teach us about Jehovah? [Mar. 31, w09 3/1 p. 15 pars. 3-6]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">6. How did Jehovah live up to one aspect of the meaning of his name in the days of Moses? (Ex. 3:14, 15) [Mar. 31, w13 3/15 pp. 25-26 pars. 5-6]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">7. According to Exodus 7:1, how was Moses made “like God to Pharaoh”? [Apr. 7, w04 3/15 p. 25 par. 7]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">8. Despite witnessing Jehovah’ s saving power that delivered them from Egypt, what attitude did the Israelites later display, and what lesson can we learn? (Ex. 14:30, 31) [Apr. 14, w12 3/15 pp. 26-27 pars. 8-10]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">9. Why does the expression “carry you on wings of eagles” appropriately express how Jehovah lovingly dealt with the young nation of Israel? (Ex. 19:4) [Apr. 28, w96 6/15 p. 10 par. 5-p. 11 par. 2]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">10. How is it that Jehovah brings “punishment for the error of fathers” upon future generations? (Ex. 20:5) [Apr. 28, w04 3/15 p. 27 par. 1]</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Exciting Design for New Tracts!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Five new tracts were released at the 2013 “God’s Word Is Truth!” District Conventions. Additionally, Kingdom News No. 38, entitled “Can the Dead Really Live Again?” has been added to the series of tracts. All six of these tracts have an exciting new design. What are the reasons for the new format? When we offer them from house to house, how can we make good use of their design features?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. What items for the ministry have an exciting new design?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why the New Design?: </span><span class="font9">Effective house-to-house presentations often include these four steps: (1) Ask a viewpoint question to start a conversation. (2) Share a thought from the Scriptures. (3) Offer literature for the householder to read. (4) Leave a question to answer next time, and make arrangements to return. The tracts’ new design helps us easily to follow all four steps.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Use Them: </span><span class="font9">(1) After giving a greeting, show the householder the intriguing multiple-choice question on the front of the tract, and ask for his opinion. (2) Open the tract, and consider “What the Bible Says.” Read the scripture directly from the Bible when circumstances allow. If the householder has time, discuss “What That Can Mean for You.” (3) Offer the tract, and encourage him to read the rest at his convenience. (4) Before you leave, show him the question on the back under “To Think About” and make arrangements to discuss the Bible’s answer next time.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">2. What is the purpose of the new design?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. How might we offer one of the new tracts in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>New Video forStarting</span><br><br><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Bible Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">A brief video entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Why Study the Bible?</span><span class="font9"> is reaching a vast audience on jw.org. The video is designed to motivate interested people to accept our offer of a free Bible study. It can be accessed by selecting “Request a Bible Study” at the bottom of the home page or by scanning the QR (quick response) code printed on the back of each of our new tracts. Here are some ways that we can make good use of the video.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">• </span><span class="font9">When making a return visit, say to the householder: “May I show you a short video that explains how you can get answers to your Bible questions?” If he agrees, show him the video on your mobile device oron his own computer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The return visit is easy too. Simply use the cited scriptures on the back of the tract to answer the question you raised at the conclusion of your last visit. Before you leave, point out the picture of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Good News</span><span class="font9"> brochure, show the householder the brochure and the designated lesson that contains more information on the subject, and offer the brochure. If he accepts it, make arrangements to discuss the brochure on your next visit. You have started a Bible study! Or instead of offering the brochure, you could offer another tract and arrange to return to discuss it with the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Tracts have been used in our ministry for over 130 years. Although their size and format have varied, they have been a very effective witnessing tool. May we make good use of this new design to continue spreading Bible knowledge earth wide. —Prov. 15:7a.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">4. How could we use the new tracts on the return visit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5. What value do tracts have in our ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> Ifwe place one of the new tracts while engaging in informal or public witnessing, point out the QR code and encourage the person to scan it with his mobile device. Since in many languages the QR code takes you directly to the video on our Web site, it may be possible to play the video on the spot using your mobile device.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font9"> Tell coworkers, schoolmates, relatives, and other acquaintances about the video, and offer to show it to them. Or e-mail them a link to the video, and invite them to view iton their own.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">By making use of this new provision, we may be able to start more Bible studies, spiritually assisting those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”—Acts 13:48.</span></p>

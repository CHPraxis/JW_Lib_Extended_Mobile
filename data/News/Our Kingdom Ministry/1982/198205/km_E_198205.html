<p><span class="font2">Effectively Using the Symbolic &quot;Horses&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “The heads of the horses were as heads of Hons, and out of their mouths fire and smoke and sulphur issued forth . . . the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with these they do harm.” (Rev. 9: 17, 19) Have you seen such horses? Have you worked with them? Yes you have, if you have helped publicize Jehovah’s judgment message against false religion, the most reprehensible part of Satan’s visible system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">- These symbolic horses of Revelation chapter 9 represent the hundreds of millions of printed publications distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses during these last days under the direction of the anointed remnant. On pages 246 and 247, the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God”</span><span class="font3"> states: ‘‘The charging, of these symbolic ‘horses’ increased greatly when the Watch Tower's magazines began to be offered on the streets, from house to house, from store to store.” During this one month of May 1982, more than 35 million of these symbolic horses, copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font3"> will</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Continue Assisting Those Who Attended the Memorial</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> As Jesus celebrated that first Memorial with his apostles, he said to them, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Keep doing</span><span class="font3"> this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22: 19) He was referring to that which took the place of the Passover supper. Since we are concerned with those newly interested ones who attended the Memorial last month, how can we help them to associate with us at other congregation meetings? Their spiritual progress in the truth depends on continued assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jesus surely set a fine example in &gt;&nbsp;this regard. He continued assisting his disciples even though they temporarily abandoned him that eventful night. He said: “All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ ” However, he did not reject </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">them!</span><span class="font3"> His very next words were: “But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” —Matt. 26:31, 32.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>s</sup> Can we also set an example for those who have not yet reached</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">roll off the Society’s presses around the world. Will you help distribute them? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT THE &quot;HORSES” ACCOMPLISH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> This is the 44th consecutive year that the Society has emphasized the importance of having people subscribe to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Why? So the horses can do their work! Two great things are accomplished by these unusual ‘steeds.’ One is that deadly plagues result from the fire, smoke and sulphur issuing from their mouths. In God’s Word, horses symbolize war; so we must effectively use these provisions in our spiritual warfare. This takes courage, but we can muster that courage from the “horses” themselves as this is what is represented by their having “heads of lions.” The plague is on Christendom and all enemies of God’s Messianic kingdom. Let us all be zealously involved in this spiritual warfare in May by offering subscriptions to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>i</sup> Secondly, there are those whose heart is in full agreement with what the fearsome “horses” are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font3"> 2) full spiritual strength, in effect, by ‘going ahead of them’? Surely the elders will want to take the lead in spiritual matters. (Matt. 28:20) It is the Christian thing to do. Do you not agree? But how? First of all, we have to know </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">whom</span><span class="font3"> to assist. So if someone you invited did attend, it would be good to let your congregation book study conductor know about that interested person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The next question is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font3"> to assist them. We never want to underestimate the powerful effect the Memorial celebration can have on an interested person. It brings home dramatically what God and Christ have done for him or her personally. The Memorial softens the heart and makes it more receptive to further spiritual intake. In an African country a few years ago, a congregation of about 100 publishers put a large sign in front of their meeting place that simply said “MEMORIAL.” Then they distributed 1,000 invitations. The result? Nine hundred and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p>

Also, remind brothers to read article “What’s Happening in the Schools?” in May 8 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">Much good would be accomplished if parents encouraged their schoolage children to place copies of this issue with their teachers as well as school principals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">16 min: </span><span class="font3">Over the years many have associated with the truth, perhaps attending meetings for a time or even becoming publishers, but then drifted away for one reason or another. Elder can give brief talk highlighting points from May 1, 1982, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> article ‘Return to the Shepherd of Your Souls.’ Encourage study conductors to cooperate with the service overseer and secretary in arranging visits on those who might appreciate this article. We want to leave it with them, perhaps study it with them if convenient and give them encouragement to come to meetings. By working with the service overseer and secretary we can avoid a duplication of effort. However, any publisher who has someone in mind needing help might suggest it to the secretary so that none are missed. Prepare two demonstrations by qualified publishers to illustrate application of points in talk. One can show publisher just leaving the magazine and encouraging former associate to read the article and come to meetings, possibly referring to Proverbs 2:20-22 to show need to keep close to Jehovah. The next demonstration can show publisher being invited into home, presenting magazine and suggesting they spend a little time going through the material. Publisher then proceeds with study of the article.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>1982 “KINGDOM TRUTH” DISTRICT CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Those who desire to gain God’s approval must walk in his truth and serve him in truth. (Josh. 24:14) True Christians must carefully follow the direction outlined in the Bible, if they are to walk in the truth. This was done by the first-century Christians as testified to by the apostle John who wrote to a fellow believer named Gaius. John stated: “For I rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness to the truth you hold, just as you go on walking in the truth. No greatei’ cause for thankfulness do I have than these things, that I should be hearing that my children go on walking in the truth.” (3 John 3, 4) Our convention this summer will highlight the theme “Kingdom Truth.” It will help us to appreciate better Jehovah’s word of truth and the need to keep proclaiming this Kingdom truth to others. (Matt. 28:19, 20) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> for February provided helpful information about rooming accommodations and listed the convention cities and dates. By this time you have no doubt made your initial plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTEND ALL FOUR DAYS: </span><span class="font0">Make every endeavor to attend all four days of the convention. The opening session will begin at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. This will allow most of the brothers to travel to the convention city on Thursday morning and thus cut down expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been observed that in the past some of our brothers have not been attending the convention on Thursday and Friday. They have hesitated to take time off from secular employment. If this has been true in your case, please give consideration to putting forth a special effort so that you can be at the convention all four days, not just on the weekend. Admittedly this may necessitate making other sacrifices. But we are confident that Jehovah will richly bless the effort that you put forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you know, in many parts of the world our brothers overcome great obstacles in order to gather together with their brothers at conventions. Last summer a married couple from Eastern Europe traveled over 240 miles on a tandem bicycle in order to be with their Christian brothers who were assembling in Austria. By special effort a 74-year-old sister in the United States who had lost both legs was able to be in attendance at a district convention last year. She put forth great effort and the local brothers rendered loving assistance. It was necessary to lift her in a sling into the back seat of an automobile, and when arriving at the convention site, the procedure had to be reversed in order to get her into a wheelchair. Despite her handicap, this faithful sister was able to attend and was richly blessed as a result. Perhaps you know of other individuals from your congregation or circuit who have put forth similar effort. Are we not all encouraged and stimulated to follow their wholesome example?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is strongly recommended that you attend the convention to which your circuit is assigned, as outlined in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font0"> Of course, some may have extenuating circumstances, such as prearranged vacation dates that cannot be changed, the need to assist relatives living in another area, and so forth. The Society endeavors to determine in advance the approximate attendance at each of the conventions. This information is then used to determine what accommodations are needed and what supplies, such as food and literature must be ordered. When many of the brothers do not cooperate, serious problems can result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ENDEAVOR TO BE A GOOD LISTENER: </span><span class="font0">All should strive to be in their seats on time and concentrate on the program. This is not always easy as we must sit for extended periods of time and may be faced with distractions that can easily break our train of concentration. A purpose of the convention is to assist us to act on what we hear. Therefore, we do not want to rob ourselves of this important reason for attending by failing to give the program the attention that it merits. At Proverbs 1:5 we are told: “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction, and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction.” Listening involves paying attention and this requires concentration. We will want to give our full attention to the speaker, being determined to listen earnestly with our ears, mind and heart. When our minds start to wander, we must refuse to give in, so as not to become mentally lazy. Rather, we should continue to focus our attention on the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What are some things that will help? (1) Each day fix in your mind the convention theme and the theme for the day. Thereafter, as each part is presented, endeavor to tie in the information with these basic themes. (2) Take brief notes. These will assist in isolating the key thoughts and Bible texts, impressing them on your mind. (3) During each talk or presentation, think of constructive questions related to the subject and watch to see if the speaker answers them. (4) Reflect on what the speaker says, summarizing it, reviewing it, fixing it firmly in your mind and heart. (5) Listen with the right motive, not to criticize either the material or delivery, but to get points that will help you to understand the truth better. (6) Endeavor to get proper rest at night, and do not overeat before sessions. (7) At the completion of each day’s program take time to review the information presented. This will assist you to remember and act upon what you heard. (Ps. 49:3; 77:11, 12) Are you a good listener? In what areas could you improve? A good time to put these suggestions into practice in advance is while attending congregation meetings locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT WHILE ATTENDING CONVENTION: </span><span class="font0">In reporting on the 1981 district convention where he attended, an appreciative elder reported: “The program was excellent and the message was very timely and clear.”’ Commenting further, he said: “Most were very attentive; there was very little activity in the hallways, etc. The brothers demonstrated respect for the information that was presented.&quot; At another convention site the stadium manager volunteered this comment: “I was at the stadium on Saturday afternoon and listened to several of the talks. I was impressed at your discipline and orderliness. I have never seen the likes of it in this stadium before. Please tell your brothers and sisters that we are grateful that you came.” Jehovah is most pleased when our conduct reflects favorably our fine Christian training and brings honor to God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each year direction is given related to the saving of seats. This matter continues to be a problem and warrants our frank consideration. Please do not unnecessarily save seats so that others are forced to spend time walking around looking for a place to sit. Let us consider a few examples of what has happened. One family of four reported that they experienced difficulty locating seats due to the fact that countless seats were saved early each morning for individuals who had not yet arrived. On the final day of the convention this family rose at 5:30 a.m. and were at the convention site before the doors were opened. At 7:00 a.m. the friends were allowed to enter and immediately they dispersed in all directions in a frantic effort to locate choice seats. Within the first 15 minutes it was reported that literally hundreds of the best seats had been covered with magazines, Bibles, and programs by a few brothers and sisters who were representing their families and friends. In some cases entire rows were reserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is one thing to save seats for one’s immediate family, an infirm publisher, or perhaps a newly interested person you have invited, but is it loving for an individual to reserve several seats or entire rows of seats and then give them to personal acquaintances? An interested person agreed to take his family, who were Jehovah’s Witnesses, to a convention last summer. He later reported that they rose early and were at the convention site nearly two hours before the morning program began. For the next 30 minutes they combed the entire grandstand area, looking for four seats together. None could be found. Countless seats were saved, but not occupied. Finally they located a wooden bench in the bleacher area. Halfway through the morning session, while taking his young son to the restroom, this interested person observed that several of the &quot;saved” seats in the grandstand area were still empty! Other reports indicate that at some locations whole blocks of seats were reserved. Some even have attempted to save seats overnight. The sad thing is that sometimes these seats are still unoccupied hours after the program begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a person attends a public event, it is not uncommon to be charged an admission fee that entitles that individual to one seat. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not charge admission, as we are guests of the Society. However, guests normally do not have at their disposal more than one seat per person. He does not take it upon himself to reserve seats and assign them out to others as though he were the host. Do we demonstrate appreciation for the Society’s loving provision and are we considerate of the needs of our dear brothers and sisters? Do we go out of our way to assist others so that they will be more comfortable? Do we demonstrate genuine consideration for others, regarding them as superior to ourselves and reflect the fruitage of the spirit in this regard? (Phil. 2:3; Gal. 5:22, 23; 1 Cor. 13: 2-8) What have you observed in the past? What can you and your family do to help alleviate this problem?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we are holding a seat or two and the session starts, our Christian conscience should move us to relinquish any seat we are saving, unless we know that the one who is to sit there will arrive soon. Please cooperate fully with the attendants in these matters. How refreshing it is to see our brothers, including children, freely offering their seats to elderly or infirm persons who may not have found a place to sit and listen. By showing such loving concern we demonstrate that we really have the truth and are sincerely concerned about the physical and spiritual needs of others.—Phil. 2:4; 1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During sessions it is important that we be considerate of those around us. If we engage in conversation with family and friends while the program is' in progress, we not only miss vital information ourselves but also disturb others nearby. If a small child begins to cry and you are unable to quiet him quickly, it shows loving consideration to take him to an area where he will not disturb others. It is good when children are sitting with their parents and paying attention to the program. As parents, do we always arrange to have our children sit with us and keep them with us, even before and after the sessions? Occasionally children of Witness parents have involved themselves in mischief that has harmed persons and property. As Christian parents, have we properly supervised our family? As children, are we quick to follow our parents’ direction?—Deut. 6:7; 31:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses, both young and old have demonstrated wholesome conduct while in convention cities and this has not gone unnoticed by the public. Many sincere persons are impressed and some even have investigated the truth as a direct result of observing our Christian conduct. At hotels, motels and private homes where we are accommodated, we will especially want to demonstrate wholesome conduct. Do not be thoughtless or make loud noises that will be disturbing to others. We still receive reports of children playing by themselves on elevators or running uncontrolled in hallways. At one motel, Witness children left so many bars of soap in the swimming pool that the filtering system became completely plugged, resulting in serious problems for the management. Some conventioners, in making arrangements for accommodations, reserved blocks of rooms and then failed to keep their commitment, without letting the management know of their change of plans. Could we perhaps show more concern in these areas?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS: </span><span class="font0">Arrangements will be made at each convention for field service on Friday following the conclusion of the afternoon session at 4:05. This will give all the opportunity to participate in the service in the early evening. We are pleased that at most conventions last year the field service arrangements were well supported. At one convention with over 7,000 in attendance, it was estimated that approximately 5,000 shared in the ministry. This is indeed very commendable and reflects the zealous spirit that we should all demonstrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font0">Much work goes into the preparation of our conventions and many volunteer workers are needed. As in the past, various departments will take the initiative, inviting individuals in advance to assist. However, some of the larger departments will still need many more volunteers. Your congregation’s convention coordinator will receive information listing departments still in need of volunteers and he will make this known in the congregation. No volunteer service applications will be sent to the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Children 16 years of age or under must work together with a parent or other adult at all times. We encourage parents and their children to volunteer and work together, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There will be need for some last-minute volunteers. If you want to assist, please go to the Volunteer Service desk when arriving at the convention. The responsible brothers will inform you of where help is needed. Your willing service will be very much appreciated and will help toward the operation of a successful convention.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font0">Food and drink will once again be provided, following the procedure that has been used in recent years. We are most thankful foi' the hard work of our brothers and sisters who provide for our physical needs. As in past years, there may be surplus food available at the conclusion of the Sunday program. If so, perhaps you could purchase some of these items before returning home. Your cooperation in this will be a fine contribution indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The convention tickets in sheets worth $1 (10 tickets of 10c value) will be used for purchasing food and drink. The convention organization will make these tickets available to your congregation and you may purchase them a few weeks in advance so as to save standing in line when you first arrive at the convention site. It is suggested that you obtain enough food tickets in advance to care for your needs for the first two or three days of the convention. These tickets can be used for surplus food purchases as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Conventions have played a vital role in the lives of Jehovah’s people, both in Bible times and today. It is important that we take full advantage of the provision again this year as, without doubt, it will prove to be one of the highlights of the 1982 service year. With keen anticipation we look forward to the 1982 “Kingdom Truth” conventions and we are confident that the program will be both stimulating and faithstrengthening, aiding us to remain “steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is suggested that each publisher or family group take this insert with them to the convention and review this information on the first day. This will serve to remind and encourage us to apply the direction that has been given.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING; </span><span class="font13">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by. the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font13">you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the Special Needs arrangement you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer and camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font13">At most locations, the immersion will be cm Saturday. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the 80 questions and also chapter six in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization</span><span class="font13"> book with the elders prior to the convention. A bathing suit and towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font13">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday, 9:50 a.m. on Friday and at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. The same qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 4:50 p.m. on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service and so the sessions will conclude by 4:05 p.m. </span><span class="font3">On </span><span class="font13">Saturday the closing song and prayer are scheduled at 4:50 p.m., and on Sunday at 4:40 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS-. There </span><span class="font13">will be a meeting on Friday at 1:00 p.m. for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and would like to enter Bethel service. A meeting will be held on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font3">All </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">regular </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font13"> pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. These on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15.00 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be </span><span class="font3">re</span><span class="font13">placed at the convention. Any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only upon showing their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card. Those in Bethel service may obtain any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates at the bookroom by showing </span><span class="font3">their </span><span class="font13">Bethel Identification card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font13">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as </span><span class="font3">to </span><span class="font13">facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font13"> the lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a fine means of Identification but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation as they will </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> be available at the conventions. You will note that the lapel card has been designed in such a way that it may be used again for circuit assemblies until next summer. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font13">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aU </span><span class="font13">times and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font13"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large. gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Covering Unworked and Unassigned Territories</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> What would you think of a farmer who repeatedly went out to plant seed in the plot of ground next to his home, but never got around to planting the fertile plot some distance away? Obviously he would get better results if he tried to grow crops on more of his land.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Yet it is sometimes like that when it comes to working territory. We may work in certain territories repeatedly, and yet other territories may not be worked. It is true that, some territories are scattered or difficult to reach and the increasing cost of transportation can be a factor. It is also true that some territories are more productive than others. (Compare Matthew 13:3-8) But still, we want to give everyone the opportunity to hear the &quot;good news” by planting the Kingdom seed to the extent we can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> With this in mind the brother assigned to care for the territory records encourages the local publishers and pioneers to check out territories that are less frequently worked. This may not be possible for everyone, but with good cooperation the congregation may be able to give better coverage of its territory. Sometimes more distant territories can be worked in good su</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font3">er weather when days are longer and by enlisting the help of pioneers, auxiliary pioneers or others who are out in service regularly. Study conductors can also encourage their groups to share. You may find that people are more responsive in territories that have not been worked recently. What can you do to take the “good news” to them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Besides these territories held by congregations, there are also unassigned areas. At the beginning of 1982 the territory desk in Brooklyn reported there were 344 counties or parts of counties that needed to be worked. Information was given to the congregations about this in a letter of January 1, 1982, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font3">for February contained additional information.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> If your congregation is in a position to help cover such territory during the coming months, why not write the Society to inquire about territories that need attention? There is considerable territory not being worked in the midwest and some in other areas. Territories may contain from 1,500 to 5,000 or more people, usually in scattered areas. With several car groups from a congregation working on weekends, many of these territories could be worked in a month or two.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Even a pioneer or a family group can be assigned such territory if it is available and request is made to the Society. Assignments are made on a temporary basis for no more than three months. Such activity would make vacation months long to be remembered. It would take fairly regular service for a family to cover one of these counties adequately during a vacation period. This would be a serious responsibility to accept. But if these people are just called on once this year, how many more opportunities will they have to hear and accept the truth this side of the “great tribulation”? (Matt. 24:21) This serves to emphasize the need not just to' find the interest but to cultivate it to the extent possible by return visits, studies and even by correspondence. In this way those who love the truth, no matter how difficult they are to find or how isolated, can have the opportunity to become part of Jehovah’s great earthwide family of praisers.—Eccl. 11: 6; Isa. 54:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> It may even be that you are in a position to move to where the need is greater, whether in this country or elsewhere. The Societycan tell you where help is needed, or your circuit overseer may be able to tell you of a nearby congregation needing help in regularly covering its territory. If you decide to write the Society, discuss it with the elders first to get the benefit of their advice. Please ask them to include a brief letter along with yours, giving us their recommendations. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">'Organization</span><span class="font3"> book gives more information on this on pages 134 and 135. Jesus said that he would have witnessing done in “the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Besides the considerable need to reach people in various parts of this country there is an even greater need in many other places. Are you in a position to help?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> reports on lands where there are hundreds of thousands and even millions of inhabitants for each Kingdom publisher in the country. Presently the world ratio of publishers to population is about one to 1,900—a large assignment for each dedicated Christian. So let each one do as much as he can to help in covering unassigned and unworked territories while there is yet time. (Mark 13:10) True, persecution and other problems face us in</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Getting acquainted with others in the congregation often serves as a springboard to increased association. New ones need friendships to fill the vacuum caused by the loss of previous associates. So occasionally take your book study conductor or another elder or ministerial servant with you when you conduct your home Bible study. In this way the new one will not feel he is a stranger when he begins to attend additional meetings.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOP NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Caring for &quot;Not-at-Homes&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> In order to help honest-hearted people to benefit from the Kingdom message it is necessary to talk to them. However, finding people at home is becoming increasingly difficult. Often we find that most people are not at home when calls are made during the daytime, and particularly is this true on weekdays.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Therefore when working the territory we need to keep a record of the “not-at-homes.” Possibly you have found it helpful to leave more than one line on the house-to-house record so that there will be sufficient room to enter additional information as future efforts are made. Keeping the record neat and legible can be helpful to you as well as make it easier for others who may use the record for calling at times when you are not able to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> When notations are made that a person is not at home, in addition to the date, indicate any literature you left under the door. If you leave a tract it would be helpful to show the number of the tract. In this way if the person is not at home when you call again, a different tract can be left. Then when the person is finally contacted, you will know what the individual has already received and this might provide a basis for a friendly discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Usually it is best to try a different day or hour each time you call where someone was not at home previously. More people may be found at home in the evenings. If you cannot set aside an entire evening for calling on “not-at-homes,” have you tried leaving early for the congregation meetings, making calls along the way? If you have been working territory near where you live, then little or no additional time or expense for extra travel would be involved. Of course, others in the group also may be able to make calls using the information on your house-to-house records, or they may have their own not-at-home calls in that same territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In determining if literature should be left at “not-at-homes,” have in mind not leaving anything</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is God's Kingdom Near? Matt. 6:10—We pray for it. Luke 21:31, 32—Nearness of Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that would be visible to would-be intruders. We would not want to do anything that would make problems for the householder, or reflect unfavorably on the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Where persons cannot be contacted, after several calls have been made at different times, why not try to contact the householder by telephone? When calling you may find it effective to mention your name first and state that you are calling because of not having been able to contact the individual when you called personally at his home. Also, you can refer to whatever tract or other literature was left as indicated on the house-to-house record, briefly mentioning its contents. Depending on the response of the householder, you may then be able to proceed with your presentation of the “good news.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For a midwinter month February’s service report is very encouraging. The total number of publishers is the highest for this service year and second only to the all-time peak reached last August. Another outstanding feature of the report shows 17,619 more home Bible studies were conducted compared to a year ago. May Jehovah give the increase as we zealously press forward with our Kingdom ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tion in the series of articles on God’s kingdom in the May 1 issue and then some of the powerful information presented at last year’s “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions appearing in the May 15 issue is like fire, smoke and sulphur to Satan’s system. Those with an honest heart cannot help but recognize it as the truth. As you read such articles as “The Signs of the Times—What Do They Mean to You?” “The Critical Hour Nears!” and “How You Must Act!” why not take note of field points that would help you to be effective in offering the subscription during May?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Some have held back from offering subscriptions to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> because of the increased subscription rate. Should we feel that way? Well, look at it this way, when the subscription was offered for one dollar per year that represented about one-tenth of the subscription rate of popular magazines. The present subscription rate of $3.50 per year reflects about the same ratio. But when you contrast the value of the lifesaving message of our journals with the hopeless panorama of world conditions depicted in others, the subscription rate becomes insignificant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> “The authority of the horses is in their mouths,” Revelation says. Will you let the courageous, lionlike mouths of the symbolic horses speak during May by your having an active part in offering subscriptions and individual magazines? Although magazine placements increased during the past year, they are still considerably lower than they were a few years ago. As skilled warriors we never want to say ‘retreat.’ Rather, let the symbolic horses charge into the fight, confident that the prophetic words of Revelation 9 will be fulfilled. Let us all effectively use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> during May!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">sixty-six persons were in attendance! The account ended by saying: “Much interest was aroused, and this is now diligently being followed up by home Bible study activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In most cases our meeting places are already identified. However, this experience points up two things that can be done to assist Memorial attenders. One is to direct them to the meetings and the other is to study with them. If help is needed, the book study conductor may be able to assist you in getting a regular home Bible study started. It may require a series of well-planned and well-timed return visits to accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The rate of progress a new one makes is often directly related to how much personal reading and study he does on his own. Inquire to see if he is receiving the magazines through the mail. Does he have the latest bound books, particularly the one being studied at the congregation book study? Has he obtained a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> and does he know about the provision of the daily text and comments?

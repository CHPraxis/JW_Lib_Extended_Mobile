<p><span class="font1">Share in Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What a privilege it is to be commissioned by Jehovah God as public announcers of his kingdom! As heralds of this grand government, we have the assigned duty to spread the message of its establishment far and wide. (Matt. 24: 14) People must know what the Kingdom is, what its coming means and that now is a time of decision for all.—Compare Mark 1:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A marvelous instrument in aiding us to accomplish our work is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Since March 1, 1939, the full title of this magazine has been </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. </span><span class="font12">The title describes its priinary purpose and distinguishes it from all other magazines. How appropriate it would be for us to highlight this fact during our subscription campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Have you been able to obtain subscriptions in the past? What helped you to do so? Many have said that what helped them was a positive attitude, not allowing timidity to hold them back from offering the subscription at every opportunity. During the subscription campaign last May one auxiliary pioneer set for himself the goal of placing one subscription</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">Should We Give Away Literature?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Society has received numerous reports indicating that much of the literature placed in the field is being given away. Apparently some publishers customarily refrain from asking for contributions for the literature they place. While it is certainly commendable that publishers want to get our fine literature into the hands of the public, always giving it away can present problems. For example, publishers living on a very limited income have been disturbed when they see others giving literature away while they cannot afford to do feo. Others have even observed publishers regularly giving away books while in field service. On occasions householders have expressed surprise at the mention of a contribution, stating that previous Witnesses gave a publication to them free of charge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It is true that there may be some people who really cannot afford to contribute for the literature when you call on them. But in this country such people are few. Have you noticed that many who say they cannot contribute are known to spend money for nonessentials? for each hour of service, that is, 60 subscriptions for the month. That was certainly being subscription-positive! The results? He reported that he was able to obtain 155 subscriptions to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> and three persons subscribed to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> What will your goals be for this April and May?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Something that might help you reach your personal subscription goal would be to write up a list of potential subscribers and then make a special effort to contact each One. Good possibilities might be persons who have taken the magazines before, those on magazine routes, Bible students, relatives, neighbors, workmates, classmates, persons who call regularly at your home and others. Likely you can think of many persons who would profit from a regular flow of Bible information about God’s kingdom. Will you get at least one subscription this month?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“SEEK CONTINUALLY HIS KINGDOM”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Jesus urged his disciples to ‘seek continually God’s kingdom.’ (Luke 12:31) He thus emphasized the need for us to demonstrate a steady, uninterrupted interest and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">So is it really wise for us to give away literature when going from house to house? Will it help householders to value the literature? If we do meet someone who says he cannot afford to contribute for the literature, we might offer a booklet, a back issue of one of the magazines or a tract with the expressed condition that he promises to read it. Or we may offei-to call back when he would be in a position to contribute for what we are offering.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Householders who say they have no money to contribute for the publications may be given a copy of a tract such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Is Planet Earth Near the Brink?</span><span class="font12"> Then we can follow through on the initial interest by returning to discuss points in the tract and direct attention to additional scripture texts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BACK ISSUES OF MAGAZINES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers occasionally leave back issues of magazines at doors when no one is at home, making sure, of course, that the magazines are completely out of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 80</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Consider “Bible Reading for Memorial Week.” Remind congregation there will be no Theocratic Ministry School and service meeting next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Share in Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” Question-and-answer coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Topic for Conversation. Discussion and demonstration. Review both scriptures with audience and consider possible introductions and points to tie the two scriptures together. Have demonstration of suggested presentation. After short introduction publisher could say: “We are calling on our neighbors because we believe that you are concerned about the future just as we are. As you know, right at this moment the nations have missiles pointed at one another that could virtually wipe all of mankind off the face of the earth in a matter of minutes. Do you think man will eventually find a way to prevent this from happening? Or do you think the Creator of man will need to step in? [Allow for response; be ready to adapt comments.] It is interesting to realize that millions of people have been praying for a solution when they use the words of the well known 'Lord’s prayer’ or the ‘Our Father’ prayer. [Read or quote Matthew 6:10.] This model prayer indicates that the kingdom of God is the real solution to man’s problems. Yet many people do not feel the Kingdom will come in our day. Can you think of a better time for it to come? Jesus prophetically described the critical conditions that exist today and then said these words recorded in Luke 21: 31, 32. [Read.] So this generation that saw the start of the signs in 1914 will see God’s kingdom come and put an end to these distressing conditions. But who will rule in this kingdom? Will it have subjects on the earth? People have many questions in their minds about the Kingdom, and these need Bible answers. That is why this magazine has been published. Note its title, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.”</span><span class="font12"> Then highlight a particular point in one of the articles and offer the subscription. Conclude part by encouraging all to share in first Sunday of the month activity, using Topic for Conversation in house-to-house work, and making calls to invite Seople to the Memorial on Thurs-ay, April 8.</span></p>

If they are not already subscribers to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> they should be encouraged to subscribe and to attend </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> study.

<p><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Song 62 and prayer. ________</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Give Literature? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">sight of passersby. This is not objectionable. However, in congregations where the territory is worked often, people might reason that the magazines are always free if we were to leave magazines at not-at-homes indiscriminately or each time the territory is worked. If another item, such as printed advertising material, is found at a door, it may not be good to leave our magazine on that occasion. So it is good to use discretion in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Each time free magazines are left, an effort should be made to call again. When using the back issues in such a way, some have found it effective to fold the magazine open to an article they feel would be of particular interest to the householder. This provides a fine opening for conversations when calling on those who were not at home previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> Jehovah does not want any persons to be destroyed; so we should take advantage of every opportunity to spread the “good news.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Some time ago an elder in England was going from house to house and left a copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> under a door where no one was at home. The householder was so interested in the contents of the magazine that he phoned Jehovah’s Witnesses. A study was started and he made rapid progress, recognizing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN WITNESSING INFORMALLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">7 It is understandable that when witnessing informally to relatives or other acquaintances we may wish to present them with a giftcopy of a publication and not ask </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Helping Hand_____</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Christians “to be ready for every good work.” (Titus 3:1) This suggests being prepared in mind and disposition to handle such an assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ Questions are especially helpful in effective teaching, as Jesus Christ often demonstrated. (Luke 10:36) When using the printed questions, we want to teach and not be satisfied with answers that are merely read from the publications. It 'may be appropriate to ask additional questions to stimulate thinking and get the person to put the thoughts into his own words. Leading or viewpoint questions are quite effective in doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> What a blessing it will be to see some of our brothers who have become inactive really helped by these Bible studies and once again join us in spreading the Kingdom message far and wide! We will rejoice in their spiritual advancement, particularly when we have been able to help personally. May we feel as did the man who searched for one sheep that had strayed. “And if he happens to find it,” said Jesus, “I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed.”—Matt. 18:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Share &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">concern for God’s government Also, the apostle Paul urged, “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">without wavering.&quot; </span><span class="font12">(Heb. 10:23) How can we do this? One important way is by being </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font12"> in Kingdom-preaching, not allowing a week to slip by without making some effort to spread our Kingdom hope. Have you made definite plans to share in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom this week?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">s Remember that the thousands who attend the Memorial celebration with us need special encouragement to maintain an active interest in God’s kingdom. How can we help them? One way is to give them a warm personal invitation to join us in our study of the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let Your Kingdom Come.’’</span><span class="font12"> The family-like atmosphere in our book studies may impress them so that they will come to appreciate the loving provisions made by Jehovah to educate his subjects. It may stimulate them to attend regularly with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VALUE YOUR ROYAL SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom government is not a product of human imagination. It is a reality and has its ambassadors, along with more than two million earthly subjects who represent it as Kingdom envoys. —-Prov. 25:13; 2 Cor. 5:18-20.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Giving Them a</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many of us remember vividly the times when we were given a helping hand by friends or family members. We appreciate what they did in our time of need. Giving a helping hand to fellow Christians is an obligation we may be called upon to fulfill.—3 John 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It was gratifying to learn in January that a 'concerted effort will now be made to aid those who have become inactive. In this connection, the May 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">carries an article entitled, ‘Return to the Shepherd of Your Souls.’ If it is arranged for you to make calls on inactive persons, why not invite them to read through this article with you? Then, in cooperation with the service overseer’s direction you may be asked to conduct a regular study with such persons. But how should we go about conducting these studies?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our main purpose in conducting a Bible study with an inactive person is to help him to regain his spiritual strength. We want to help </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font12"> appreciate that Jehovah, out of loving concern for him, has arranged for this additional help through his organization. Lasting results will be achieved only if the individual’s relationship with Jehovah is strengthened. If this is done, it will be evident by his renewing his appreciation for Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The individuals that we will be studying with in this special program are persons who have been baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses. In most eases the study will not be conducted in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. They likely know the basic doctrines of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The elders will discuss with you what publication might be best to aid the person you are asked to help. It may be that his appreciation for Jehovah’s organization needs to be enhanced. The elders may suggest using </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Let Your Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font12"> or some other book that would provide such needed assistance and encouragement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCTING THE STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>c</sup> No doubt you can remember when you conducted your very first Bible study. You felt the need to prepare well for it. No matter how many times you may have conducted a study since then, you know you will do a better job if you prepare thoroughly ahead of time. (Prov. 25:11) This is especially true regarding studies conducted with inactive brothers and sisters. Paul urged his fellow minister Titus to continue reminding</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When you read the April and May issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> you surely will agree that they deserve a wide distribution. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> of April 15 focuses on the often repeated but little understood “Lord’s prayer,” while the April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> contains a series of articles dealing with the desperate plight of young people in this modern world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Although millions routinely pray the Lord’s model prayer, how many really grasp its vital significance? For many sincere ones it would be a thrilling revelation to learn that God’s name is Jehovah, that the kingdom for which they pray is today a reality and that God’s will for the earth includes a restored earthly paradise and a resurrection of the dead. We certainly would not want to hold back such vital information as is presented in the April 15 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Surely our hearts go out to the millions of young people described in the April 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Some of them are like ‘sheep without a shepherd,’ maybe forsaken, unloved and lost in this chaotic and sick world. Given an opportunity to see the Bible’s solution for today’s problems, might not thousands of these young folks be helped into a secure, happy relationship with Jehovah? We have good reason to show our concern by being enthusiastic and energetic in helping to give these timely magazines wide distribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In offering these magazines, there is no need to give a long and involved presentation. Just one strong reason for reading a selected article will generally be sufficient to stimulate the householder’s interest, and then you can make the offer. For example, note this simple presentation: “Good morning. My friends and I are talking with our neighbors about prayers to God. Many of us still use the prayer we learned as children, that is, the ‘Lord’s prayer’ or ‘Our Father’ prayer. Although having repeated it many, many times, however, some are finding that there is really more to that prayer than what they had previously understood. That is why this special article entitled 'The Model Prayer’ has been prepared. The meaning of each phrase in the ‘Lord’s prayer’ is explained from the Scriptures. This is your copy along with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> for 30 cents.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Another approach might be:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">“Good morning. My family and I are taking some time this morning to talk to our neighbors about prayer. Do you think God is still listening to prayers? [Allow for comment] Many people have wondered if God is still listening to their prayers or if they have been praying to God in the right way. These questions are examined in the article ‘Does God Listen to Your Prayers?’ in this issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> I found it very interesting and helpful and would like to leave you this copy along with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> for a contribution of 30 cents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>0</sup> If you wish to feature </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">in magazine work, you can try this short presentation: “We are making brief calls because of our interest in the young people of our community. Perhaps you are aware that many young persons are very unhappy about life even though they have much materially. In fact, suicide has become a leading cause of death among teenagers. Why is that so? And what do young people need for a meaningful life? These questions are answered in this new issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> We want you to have this copy along with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">for a contribution of 30 cents.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> May Jehovah bless all of us as we use these fine instruments to stimulate interest in his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Give Literature? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">for a contribution. But when we are talking to strangers, as ’ in house-to-house work, it is best to offer the current literature for the regular contribution. In this way we may be helping persons to appreciate the value of what they have obtained and this may motivate them to read the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR VALUABLE LITERATURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> We do give freely of our time and our energy in sharing the truth with others. This is most appropriate, since Jesus said, “You received free, give free.” (Matt. 10:8) Our doing so requires sacrifices of time and also money to cover the expenses of transportation. However, there is no need to feel that we must bear all of the costs for the literature we place with persons in the field. Compared with the expensive popular magazines and books of today, our literature is still available for a reasonable contribution. Usually this is within the reach of just about everyone in this country. The very small contribution that is asked enhances the value of the litera-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Recognizing that we are speaking for God and Christ should make us conscious of the need to represent them in a fine way. This means that we will want to prepare carefully so that we will present the Kingdom message clearly and understandably. We should not be like employees of political governments who work for a salary, but our labors should spring from a heartfelt faith and desire to honor Jehovah God. We also want to help others to gain salvation. Thus, as we share in announcing Jehovah’s kingdom we will not merely be speaking out a message in a formal way. We will seek to use reasoning and persuasion to reach the hearts of our hearers so they also may come to believe and exercise faith.—Acts 28:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Before the Kingdom puts an end to “all these kingdoms,” let us make every effort to announce Jehovah’s kingdom and notify people in our territory of the opportunity they now have to come under its security and protection.—Dan. 2: 44, 45. ture to the householder. There is no reason for anyone to feel he is selling literature just because he asks for a small contribution to cover printing and distribution costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> May all of us continue to value the Society’s publications highly and aid those we meet in our ministry to do the same, for the knowledge our literature provides can lead to everlasting life.—-John 17:3.</span></p>

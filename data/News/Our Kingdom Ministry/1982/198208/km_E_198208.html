<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 25, No. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For all of Jehovah’s people recent months have been exceptionally busy. At the Brooklyn headquarters,, in all the branches and throughout the worldwide field, brothers have been working hard and exerting themselves. (1 Tim. 4:10) As a result much has been accomplished, due mainly to Jehovah’s blessing upon our. united efforts. It is evident that he has been making things grow.—1 Cor. 3:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Last March a dedication program was held at Brooklyn Bethel in connection with the new office annex. Members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn and at Watchtower Farms had the opportunity to tour the factory and new office facilities. They saw some of the new equipment and changes now in. operation. Also, at the present time, construction of a new addition to the existing factory at Watchtower Farms is under way. This will accommodate more presses to care for our printing needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In recent months new branch facilities have been dedicated in Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan and Korea. Four members of the Governing Body were privileged to share in these programs. The brothers in these lands are thrilled to see the work moving ahead and are prepared to give an even greater witness concerning the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of us rejoice in the new peaks reached during April in various features of the ministry, including the total number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">New publisher peaks were </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 3)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A FINE MEMORIAL REPORT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">In obedience to our Lord’s command 1,499,284 attended the Memorial celebration on April 8, 1982, here in the US. This is an all-time peak, surpassing our attendance in 1981 by 36,214. There were 4,206 partakers at the Memorial this year. In view of the excellent attendance we once again have impressed upon us that there are many who need to be taught by Jehovah in order to become actively associated with us in 'worshiping the Father with spirit and truth.’—John 4:23, 24.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Yoife—Serve</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Loyalty and godly devotion are essentials of true worship. (2 Tim. 2:19) Jehovah God rightly expects each of us to maintain a devoted attachment to him and his visible earthly organization. (Ps. 30:4; 31:23) To do this in such troublous times we must keep a clear view of our purpose in life and not allow our loyal love for Jehovah to suffer erosion. Christian youths in particular are undergoing a relentless assault on their love of God.—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Loyalty to Jehovah and his organization is necessary if we are to gain everlasting life. At this time of testing, how can Christian youths maintain integrity? In what ways can we manifest loyalty in the congregation? The family? How might parents and others encourage loyalty to God and the family?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE CONGREGATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Although the springtime of life should be a joyous experience, it brings with it serious responsibilities. (Eccl. 11:9-12:1) A principal decision young ones face involves dedication and baptism. Also, there is the selection of theocratic and secular goals. One’s choice of associates must be carefully examined. Each decision should reflect loyal love for Jehovah and the congregation. This is the only course that brings genuine satis</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Directing Interest to the Organization—Part I</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The spiritual development of newly associated ones involves their demonstrating a love of Bible truth accompanied by deep appreciation for Jehovah’s organization and its provisions. (Ps. 33:12; 119:97) Our progressive, regular study with new ones should therefore accord honor to Jehovah and his orderly arrangement for worship. If we faithfully call attention to the organization’s role in our lives, we will prove to be effective Kingdom teachers on Bible studies and stimulate the student’s further growth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> If our teaching is to be effective in-'producing true disciples of Christ, then we must faithfully help interested persons to recognize and appreciate Jehovah’s organization. Many Kingdom preclaimers have enjoyed encouraging results from systematically directing attention to the organization. What methods can you employ to stimulate interest in congregation meetings? How can our Bible students progressively become better acquainted with the organization? What helpful ideas can be used to remove any apprehension new ones faction, peace of mind and true happiness.—Ps. 149:1, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Young ones generally feel a keen sense of loyalty to friends. This can present real tests when such companions get involved in unchristian conduct. Many youths then face situations involving divided loyalties. Will you report serious wrongdoing or ignore it as if it never happened? Genuine regard for Christian associates and love of God will no doubt move you to report this in line with the principle at Leviticus 5:1. Christian youths thereby avoid becoming “a party to wickedness” by yielding to a false sense of loyalty.—Deut. 13: 6-8; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organization,</span><span class="font12"> page 181.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are a number of factors that make the above situations a challenge to the course of loyalty. First of all, as one young brother expressed it, some youths are affected by a “spirit of selfishness” rather than genuine love for their friends. (Lev. 19:17; Prov. 27:5, 6) This causes them to hesitate in getting involved so as to avoid losing the friendship of those whose wrongs have been exposed. (Prov. 9:8) Some younger ones and their parents, due to spiritual weakness, may be resentful for a time when such wrongdoing is reported. But this should not deter loyal youths </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">may experience before going to the Kingdom Hall for the first time?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> From the initial study develop the habit of speaking about the organization’ every week. The student should come to see your </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">total involvement</span><span class="font12"> with the truth, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">affection</span><span class="font12"> for your brothers and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">respect </span><span class="font12">for Jehovah’s arrangement. Speak of the brothers by name and take other enthusiastic ones with you to the study. This can contribute to a lively and progressive weekly discussion. In time, the student may well reflect your own appreciation and enthusiasm for the Christian congregation.—Luke 6:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What can be done to remove any fears new' ones may have about attending meetings for the first time? Some experienced publishers have found it helpful to explain the purpose and function of the Kingdom Hall. After one interested family had refused many invitations to congregation meetings, the brother conducting the study found it convenient to take this family to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

However, this need not be very timeconsuming. Consider the personality of the student as well as his response to Bible truths thus far.

<p><span class="font12">An illustrated calendar for 1983 has been prepared that is both beautiful and practical. It will feature six large four-color pictures on Kingdom-preaching themes, showing two months under each picture. When opened for wall hanging it will measure approximately 11-3/8 inches by 17-1/2 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to the yeartext and Memorial date, it lists field service days to help us to regularly share with the congregation in group witnessing. As a reminder to keep up with our Bible reading, it provides the weekly schedule. It also lists the dates for our written reviews so that we can prepare for a fuller share in this feature of the Theocratic Ministry School. You can readily appreciate the spiritual benefits these features provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The calendar will be printed in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. Calendars are 75c each. There is no pioneer rate. Please order the quantity you desire through the literature servant, as it is a controlled stock item and will not be stocked by the congregation. Because of the high cost of postage, we would request that orders be combined through the congregation, rather than sent individually to the Society. The initial congregation order should be mailed with the July remittance by August 6, 1982, or no later than August 15, using the Special Calendar Order form (S-5) that has been sent to each congregation. This will assure your receiving the 1983 calendar in good time.</span></p>

By far, the majority of the congregation appreciate and respect such courageous loyalty in our young ones.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Loyal youths share in congregation meetings, as well as in the field ministry. They avoid isolating themselves. (Prov. 18:1) Increasing numbers of young ones are rejecting high-paying jobs or higher education in favor of a career in the ministry. They humbly accept counsel and direction from older ones that will enable them to continue in loyal sacred service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What fine opportunities youths have to contribute to family unity and to grow spiritually!

How refreshing it is to see youths who have loyal-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Circuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Blameless as Lightbearers Amid a Twisted Generation” is the theme of our current circuit assembly program, soon to conclude. This excellent program is providing “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24:45) Those with good spiritual eyesight can see that our present generation 'is “crooked and twisted.” (Phil. 2:15) Useful counsel and suggestions were given on how to avoid any involvement that would bring upon us Jehovah’s disfavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The theme for the fall series of circuit assemblies starting in September is “Making the Truth Manifest in Our Lives.” (2 Cor. 4:2) Do we really know the truth and are we practicing it in our lives? The program is designed to offer practical help in both of these areas </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">— knowing</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font12"> the truth. Pioneering will be highlighted, especially for younger ones. Information related to handling objections in the field and helping school children to combat the theory of evolution will be considered. The part, “By Keeping Strict Watch on How We Walk” will emphasize the need for each of us to watch carefully how he is building spiritual qualities in both himself and in those with whom he studies. The public talk is entitled: “How Does the Truth Affect Your Life?” It will be followed by two discourses: “Living Today With Soundness of Mind” and “Walking Orderly in the Truth With Jehovah’s Organization.” We urge you not to miss any of this excellent assembly program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ly submitted to parental direction in the truth! Reflecting on his personal experience and how much his mother had helped him spiritually, one Bethel brother expressed appreciation that he was never a part of the world and its ways.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> All in the congregation can do much to encourage young ones in loyal service. Help them set spiritual goals of working in behalf of the congregation and eventual full-time service. (See Proverbs 16:3.) Share regularly with them in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> A spirit of rebelliousness pervades this dying old system. Acts of disloyalty are the order of the day. Whether young or old, we must counteract any trends that could undermine our worship of Jehovah. Look to Jehovah for the joys and blessings his service affords. Youths, view life’s responsibilities soberly and face each day’s challenges with loyalty and godly devotion.</span></p></li></ul>

(Zech. 8: 20-23; 1 Cor. 14:24, 25) Imitate Jesus and enthusiastically direct honest-hearted ones to Jehovah’s visible organization. Future issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> will outline additional suggestions, including use of the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century</span><span class="font12"> in directing interest to the organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Using “My Book of Bible Stories&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> has filled a need. Parents interested in teaching their children needed a book designed for that purpose. The Society saw that need and filled it. The book is simple but not childish. Its large print is appreciated by both young and old. Its many pictures are appealing to young minds. The short stories, related in a colorful manner, hold attention of youngsters. Children need something that extracts the lessons and principles from a Bible story and explains them in a way that young minds can grasp.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> After finding it difficult to conduct a family study, one parent that started using the book happily told us: “My children and I now find it a great pleasure.” Obviously pleased, a mother wrote: “My five-year-old never fails to bring the book to me at bedtime.” After a few studies with her children, another parent happily observed: “It is amazing how much their little minds can grasp!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We have also heard from youngsters who like the book. One told us that “it makes the Bible come alive!” A teenager related: “When I started reading it, it was very hard to put it down.” An eight-year-old exclaims: “It is my favorite book ever since I have been living!” A ten-year-old expressed appreciation for the book saying: “I would like to have faith in Jesus like his disciples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> These expressions should encourage us to make good use of this book. Can you think of opportunities to offer it informally to others? Some youngsters have taken it to school and placed copies with their classmates. A number of teachers have taken copies and some of them have later read stories to their classes. Numerous placements have resulted from simply showing the book to visiting friends or neighbors. Offering it as a gift to relatives or workmates has accounted for many placements. One brother was able to start many conversations about the Bible simply by displaying and reading the book during his daily ride on public transportation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories </span><span class="font12">book from door to door, many feel that if they can get it into the hands of the householder, it will virtually place itself. Its modest cost is appealing. Many adults find its simple, direct approach to the Bible to be refreshing; do not hesitate to offer it to them. If older persons you meet have other interests, offer any one of the 192-page books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> How could you start </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> conversation using the book? You might ask: , “Do you think the earth will ever be a happy and peaceful place to live?” Turn to story 71 and relate highlights from Isaiah 11:6-9 or Revelation 21:3, 4. Or, you might pose this question: “Do you find it difficult to explain the Bible to your children? If so, this book can help -you. Let me show you how it can help you to explain the meaning of the Lord’s prayer.” Review the highlights of story 91.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Also, remember that the entire text of this book is now available on cassette tapes. Parents have found them ideal for teaching the Bible to children who have not yet learned to read. What an excellent way to help them develop their reading ability, and at the same time, learn the fundamentals of God’s Word. The use of these tapes may divert their attention away from the unwholesome television programming which causes parents so much concern. When making return visits on families who have shown interest, inform them of the cassette tapes and describe their practical value.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> So, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories </span><span class="font12">has filled a need. It can help us fulfill our God-given responsibility to rear our children “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” We will‘find cause for real joy in being able to impart “the comfort from the Scriptures” that can bring our children a sure hope for the future.—Eph. 6:4; Rom. 15:4.</span></p></li></ul>

In quite a number of countries April was the best month thus far in reporting total hours, return visits, home Bible studies and auxiliary pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With overseers taking the lead, publishers and pioneers everywhere are demonstrating a zealous spirit in developing new interest and directing Bible students to the organization. Also, there is no question that the house-to-house ministry is reaching more of the ‘deserving ones.’ (Matt. 10:11) What a grand privilege we have to be engaged in this holy work of the good news! —Rom. 15:15, 16.</span></p>

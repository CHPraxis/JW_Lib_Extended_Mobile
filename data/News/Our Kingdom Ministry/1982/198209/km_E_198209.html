<p><span class="font12">Rejoicing in Jehovah's Bountiful Provisions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Always rejoice in the Lord. Once more I will say, Rejoice!” (Phil. 4:4) Jehovah’s Witnesses are indeed rejoicing, due to the bountiful provisions that we have received during the 1982 service year. There is no doubt that Jehovah has blessed us abundantly. —Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Consider some of the provisions for which we can be thankful. Over 40,000 elders received further instruction at the Kingdom Ministry School and many of our regular pioneers were able to attend the Pioneer Service School during the month of August. We were privileged to hear the special talk “The Only Cure for Sick Mankind” and experience the joy of an all-time peak attending the Memorial celebration in April. There was also an all-time peak in publishers during the month of April. Then again, a fine provision has been made to aid many individuals who had become inactive through the years.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Directing Interest to the Organization-Part II</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It is the earnest desire of Christian teachers to help their home Bible students to acquire a spiritually solid foundation. This is accomplished by progressively studying God’s written Word, sounding its truths down into their minds and hearts. (Matt. 7:24-27) More is necessary than simply teaching doctrinal information. We must build appreciation for Jehovah’s organization so that our students will act upon what they have learned and become a working part of the Christian congregation. (Jas. 2:26) From time to time publishers contact the Society, asking for suggestions and printed material that they can use in helping their Bible students. As you will recall the August issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> recommended using the brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century. </span><span class="font9">These can be ordered by the congregation if local supplies are depleted. Each brochure is placed on a contribution of 15c and is reported as a booklet placement. We suggest that you give consideration to using this brochure as it contains a wealth of information that can be used with both new and advanced students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But, without doubt, one of the outstanding highlights of the service year was the “Kingdom Truth” District Convention, with its fine releases. Yes, Jehovah has surely blessed his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WILL WE DO NOW?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> As we all look back on the bountiful provisions that we have received from Jehovah during the service year just concluded, it is proper to ask ourselves, ‘What will we do now?’ Unitedly we will press on, even more firmly in our resolve to continue faithfully serving Jehovah. We will endeavor to apply the things that we have learned as well as make good use of the valuable information and literature received at the district conventions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VALUE OF “TRUTH” BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> In thinking back over an extended period of time, we realize that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book has been an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> This 32-page brochure, first released in 1978, was designed to acquaint people with the organization and work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It was offered to the public when released at the convention and later from house to house in 1979. It provides an excellent witness. You should take the initiative in placing copies with your Bible students, if you have not already done so. The Scriptural references, illustrations and text can all be of great assistance in reaching the hearts of sincere persons.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Let us consider material that may be especially effective with a new student. Congregation meetings play an important role in the lives of Jehovah’s people and so we want our students to attend these meetings with us as soon as possible. This subject is considered on pages 18-20 of the brochure. Each of the five weekly meetings is briefly described and Scriptural references are cited. You may find it helpful to read with the student the two paragraphs starting at the bottom of page IS.

Elder reviews with audience participation the following points related to good manners: (2 min.) Good manners have been defined as showing consideration in little things such as being punctual, asking before borrowing things that belong to others, giving thanks and saying “please,” and so forth. The basic underlying principle is love. (10 min.) In the congregation: Families with small children show consideration for others by taking seats in the rear so as not to disturb others. When babies cry, consideration and good manners are demonstrated by parents if they temporarily withdraw from the main auditorium to calm the child. (Compare Matthew 7:12.) Christian manners rule out talking while the meeting is in progress, arriving late for meetings or allowing children to interrupt the meeting by frequent and unnecessary trips to the rest room, or by their running at any time in the Kingdom Hall. (Eccl. 3:1, 7; 1 Cor. 14:40) When attending the book study, it would be appropriate to dress as when attending the regular meetings at the Kingdom Hall. (8 min.) In field service: Christian manners require that one be presentable when in field service — neat, clean, shoes shined, hair combed, clothing pressed. A sincere and friendly smile and greeting are also part of Christian manners. (Luke 10:5) When preaching on busy streets it is necessary to be tactful, friendly, not shouting, not overly insistent, not interfering</span></p>

After introduction, publisher could say: “Due to the international tension and recent conflicts many concerned persons are wondering if the future of the earth is'really secure.” (Ask householder for his personal viewpoint.) “The Bible foretold events of our day and indicated that many persons would be overwhelmed with fear.” (Read or quote Luke 21:26.) Show how many persons are becoming increasingly fearful. However, those who put their trust in God and his kingdom have basis for hope. (Read Psalm 119:90.)

<p><span class="font11">Are You Having a Share in Assisting Inactive Ones?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.” (Luke 15:6) This feeling of rejoicing is being experienced by many brothers and sisters in congregations where inactive ones are returning to the flock. In these critical days it is indeed a joy to be able to assist some of our brothers who, for one reason or another, stopped associating with us. We share Jehovah’s viewpoint concerning them, that “it is not a desirable thing . . . for one of these little ones to perish.”—Matt. 18:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Of course, in order for more of us to have this joy, continued effort is required. Why? A lost sheep is usually quite helpless. It is the shepherd who does the searching to recover it. Thus, a real effort is necessary to search for, find, and then nourish a lost sheep. In his illustration, Jesus indicated that the shepherd would leave the ninety-nine behind and go for the lost one </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">until he finds it.—</span><span class="font9">Luke 15:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW ALL CAN HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The February issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> indicated that the secretary and the service overseer will coordinate matters in order to assign well-qualified publishers to conduct home Bible studies with inactive ones. However, this does not mean that the rest of the congregation cannot help also. Positive results have been obtained by the united efforts of all the publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Recently a circuit overseer visited a former special pioneer couple who had been inactive for two years. After telling the traveling brother of their problems, with many tears, they both decided to come back to the congregation. In time they began sharing in the field service. How do they feel now? The wife states: “I would like to express my appreciation for the Christian love and warmth you have shown us. I felt like I had a two-ton load lifted off of me.” She concluded her letter to the circuit overseer, saying: “I pray that this will never happen to me again. Heartfelt thanks for coming when you did and for even coming back after my being cool to you. You helped me to see things were not hopeless. I will never forget you.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> It is good to recognize that for persons who have been away from the congregation it may be somewhat difficult to attend meetings once again. Timidity or shame may make it difficult for them at first. How loving it would be for all of us to take the initiative in greeting these individuals when they come to the Kingdom Hall. It will show them that we are happy, yes, that we “rejoice” to have them with us. Our show of concern should not be limited to their initial return, but every time they come to the Kingdom Hall we should make them feel welcome. Are you having a share in assisting inactive ones in this way?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> We are pleased to see that many congregations have experienced positive results because of taking to heart the program of assisting inactive ones. A circuit overseer reported recently that in one congregation seven were reactivated. One sister told the elders she had been waiting for someone to call and assist her, as she found it difficult to begin associating again on her own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> It is possible that some may not want to be helped. Jesus said: “IF he happens to find it,” he rejoices. (Matt. 18:13) So, if it happens that we do not have success in reactivating some, we will not be overly disappointed, knowing that we tried hard to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Searching for something that has been lost usually takes time, patience and a positive attitude. Results may not come as quickly as we would like. But this is no reason to .become discouraged. We need to keep on expending ourselves in this, knowing that it is “not a desirable thing . . . for one of these little ones to perish.” (Matt. 18:14) May we all endeavor to have a share in assisting inactive ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">to come, you can progressively explain in detail the five weekly meetings, highlighting their purpose, how they are conducted, publications used, .and so forth. You may want to concentrate on considering one meeting in detail each week, thus having sufficient subject material for a five week period. Do you not agree that such a program should assist your student to appreciate better the need to attend congregation meetings?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> At an appropriate time you may take up with your student the matter of contributions. You may mention to him that Jehovah’s Witnesses gladly give of their time and resources in conducting free home Bible studies. But when it comes to support and maintenance of their organization, such as the local Kingdom Hall, expenses are involved. However, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not take up collections at their meetings, as do the churches of Christendom. A contribution box is provided at the meeting place and those attending may contribute if they so desire. This is entirely voluntary. Pages 29 and 30 of the brochure may be used as a basis for this discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It may be explained that while Christians are not required to tithe they still have countless opportunities to honor God with their “valuable things.” (Prov. 3:9, 10) Review principles recorded at 2 Corinthians 9:7 and Luke 21: 1-4 with the student showing that our giving is motivated by Christian love and that it is the spirit of giving that counts, not the amount given. Christian giving is a wonderful privilege that affords us the opportunity to display our love for Jehovah and for our brothers. Progressive Bible students will appreciate learning these things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Are we as teachers doing all that we can to help our students gain appreciation for Jehovah’s organization? Could we do more? We encourage you to employ these suggestions, praying to Jehovah for his continued direction and blessing. Additional information on this subject will be forthcoming.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">In School</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “Praise Jehovah . . . you young men and also you virgins, you old men together with boys.” (Ps. 148:7, 12) While attending school youths have a splendid opportunity to praise the name of Jehovah. Among their classmates, as well as school teachers, a large field for witnessing is opened. At times it may seem difficult to witness to classmates or teachers. But there is no need to feel embarrassed or afraid. Jehovah has promised: “I am with you to deliver you.” —Jer. 1:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO WITNESS IN SCHOOL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Consider the following questions: .‘Do I take advantage of opportunities at school to speak about Jehovah’s purposes? Does my conduct reflect well on Jehovah, the God with whom others identify me?’—Ps. 145:21; Matt. 21:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Take advantage of opportunities when the subject of evolution is considered. Some youthful witnesses have used such occasions to place the publication, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </span><span class="font9">with some of their teachers and classmates. They have used this book in class discussions in skillfully defending the Bible’s record of the creation account. Due to the prevalence of promiscuity and misuse of drugs in school, some Christian youths have successfully used the publication, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It.</span><span class="font9"> This book considers a number of subjects that are of interest to youths.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Take the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">initiative</span><span class="font9"> in witnessing at school. Consider this experience of a Christian youth: “During free class periods I had many, many opportunities to witness, especially around holiday time. By leaving Bible publications on my desk where others could see them, many interested students approached me. The most rewarding experience involved my civics teacher. I had placed a publication with one of her students, and the girl was reading it in class one day when the teacher noticed it and asked where she had obtained the book.” Eventually a number of students began attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and the teacher also progressed to the point of becoming a dedicated Witness! All of this occurred because an alert Christian youth took the initiative to witness in school.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">daily conversations </span><span class="font9">with classmates, you can often find an opportunity to discuss a Biblical topic. With the increasing of violence and the growing fear that a nuclear war may end all life on this earth, you can easily explain to your classmates God’s view of world conditions and the future of the earth. <sub>v</sub> Remember that while you will want to be bold, it is vital to be tactful, showing consideration for the others’ viewpoints.—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>s</sup> Youths, do not minimize the fine contribution that you can make in praising Jehovah while in school. Be confident that God can use you too in the accomplishing of his purpose to have this good news preached earth wide.</span></p>

There are several subjects that can be highlighted. Chapter 1 outlines the grand blessings from God that are so near at hand. Many honest-hearted persons are fearful of world developments and are looking for a remedy. God’s kingdom is the only solution and it is through this government that blessings will come to mankind. (Matt. 6:10; Dan. 2:44) Chapter 20 outlines the building blocks for a happy family life and should be of special interest to many families in our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Chapters 2, 14 and 15 can be highlighted to show people why it is wise to examine their religion, how to identify the true religion and how they can get out from among the false ones. Babylon the Great will soon be destroyed and honest-hearted persons must act quickly if they are to be saved.</span></p>

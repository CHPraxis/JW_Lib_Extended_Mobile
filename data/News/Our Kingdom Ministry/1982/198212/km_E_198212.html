<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Wise Use of Our Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Time is a very valuable asset of each Christian. How are you using this asset&quot;! During December we should set aside regular times to engage in the house-to-house ministry, offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font12">and any 192-page book for a contribution of $3.75. Time, like money, can be wasted, even squandered, or it can be used wisely. As Christians, our love for Jehovah, Jesus Christ and our fellowman should impel us to use our time wisely, “buying out the opportune time.”—Eph. 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In so doing the Christian’s course is far different from the one pursued by those who love this old system. Paul foretold that people living in the last days would be “lovers of pleasures,&quot; and how true that is! (2 Tim. 3:4) Most people today spend many hours each week just watching TV or going to movies. Others become involved in sports, video games, excessive vacation trips, music and hobbies, all of which can take much time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITUAL THINGS FIRST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Does this mean that a Christian should not enjoy relaxation in some form of wholesome recreation? Certainly not! Even Jesus enjoyed banquets and special meals. He also</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Conduct Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Conducting a Bible study is one of the most satisfying aspects of our Christian ministry. It is a matter of writing op hearts. {2 Cor. 3:2, 3) How rewarding it is to see people with whom we study take in knowledge, apply Bible principles and bring their lives into harmony with Jehovah’s righteous requirements!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> But, suppose you do not see the desired progress—the students do not make changes as quickly as you think they should and their interest may even wander. There may be a need to examine your own ability to teach. Could the study be conducted in a more interesting and progressive manner? The following suggestions may prove to be helpful.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL TEACHING SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Preparation in advance is essential. Involved in this is having the main points of the lesson clearly outlined in your own mind with the Scriptural support at your fingertips.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Knowledge should be conveyed to the student in a simple, logical manner. If this is done in a warm, friendly and informal way, it creates an atmosphere in which the student is relaxed and able to learn. It is imtook time for needed rest. However, Jesus did not make eating, drinking or personal pleasures the big thing in his life. Rather, he took delight in doing his Father’s will. (John 4: 34) He warned us that the physical pleasures of life should not take precedence over Jehovah’s service. (Luke 21:34; Matt. 6:31-33) So we do well to follow Jesus’ example in making wise use of our time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In order to help us accomplish this it is good to view time as an asset to be used wisely. We should not use time selfishly, just for our own pleasure. Rather, we should continue to ‘buy out the time’ and support the preaching and disciple-making activity of the congregation, “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”—-1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are some practical things we can do so as to make wise use of time. One suggestion is to have a reasonable, workable schedule of activities. While at times this schedule may allow for relaxation or recreation, spiritual interests should he highlighted. It should include attendance at all congregation meetings, field service on a regular basis and taking time for personal Bible study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font12"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">portant, too, to make sure he learns practical points of personal value each visit. A student should feel that his life has been enriched and that he has been brought into a closer relationship with God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Teaching the student how to study may be helpful. This may involve helping him to pick out the main points in the material and underline key words or phrases. Help him express himself from the heart, putting answers in his own words, rather than just reading the printed material. If you build up in your student a desire for more knowledge of the subject to be discussed on the next visit, he will be more likely to prepare in advance and thus make more rapid progress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">* Reaching the heart of the individual will enable him to see how the material' studied applies to his own life. To reach hearts Jesus used questions that made his listeners think. Note examples of this at Matthew 16:13-16; 17:24-27 and Luke 10:25-27. Wise use of illustrations, as demonstrated by Jesus, is also most beneficial. Observe how illustrations</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 5 </span><span class="font12">Song 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">7 min: Local announcements. Enthusiastically encourage all to attend the Congregation Book Study as we begin to study the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Man's Salvation out of World Distress at Hand! </span><span class="font12">Also encourage support for second Saturday magazine activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font12">Talk on subject “Why Admit It When You Are Wrong?&quot; from September 1, 1982, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Elders and publishers alike need to acknowledge their own mistakes with humility and honesty, not taking themselves too seriously. This can work for the upbuilding of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Discuss Question Box. Speaker should emphasize our loving concern for the spiritual welfare of all and the need to give no cause for stumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —With Effective Introductions.” Question-and-answer discussion of material. Ask audience for introductions they have found particularly helpful. Encourage making use of such introductions in weekend field service activity. Remind all to bring their October 1, 1982, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to the meeting next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 18 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements and Announcements. Discuss how the congregation did in field activity during November, including the number of auxiliary pioneers, if any. Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Making Wise Use of Our Time.” Question-and-answer discussion of material. From paragraph 9 demonstrate briefly how street work may be done effectively by talking with people regarding specific articles rather than simply holding up magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Bring Your Heart Back to Jehovah.” Well-developed talk by a qualified elder on material from October 1, 1982, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Audience participation. Allow time for a brief demonstration to show how a parent could tactfully bring the article to the attention of his child who has become inactive. Emphasize that parents may wish to mail a copy of the article to their children if they cannot give it to them directly. It is designed to help all who were reared in the truth but have drifted away from it. (Note: This part should be rescheduled if meeting is not held because of a circuit assembly or for other reasons.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 82 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 90 &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Discuss with audience the value of making wise use of time off by sharing in the field service during worldly holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Adjustment in Theocratic Ministry School.” School overseer should discuss with audience the new adjustments in counseling for 1983. Stress the need for each student to prepare well and accept with appreciation the loving counsel given in the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">Use time for local needs or have an elder give a talk on the article “Cast Your Anxieties Upon Jehovah” in the September 15, 1982, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Remind publishers to share in field service on fourth Saturday, which is part of the holiday weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 87 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements. Re</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">to keep abreast of the truth. Now you will be able to use the new calendar to help schedule your time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Parents, of course, have the additional responsibility of helping their children to be active in spiritual things. So they may find it advisable to sit down and work out a reasonable schedule of theocratic activity for the whole family, including their own personal schedules as Christian parents. Thus, they show a personal interest in their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">children's</span><span class="font12"> welfare and their wise use of time.—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> It is often helpful to have personal goals in connection with our field ministry. Such should be reasonable, attainable goals. We may decide to spend a certain number of hours in field service each month. If we really work toward our goal we wall seldom fail to meet it and may often surpass it. Many have found either auxiliary or regular pioneering to be a reasonable goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Improving the quality of service is also a worthy goal. Can you think of ways in which you can make better use of your time in the ministry? For example, could you improve your teaching ability at the doors by using more effective introductions? (See “Presenting the Good News.”) Could you be more effective in conducting Bible studies or improve the way you direct interested persons to Jehovah’s Word and his organization? In doing so you can truly mind brothers of new public talks scheduled for January. Encourage all to attend and bring their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book along to mark in it particular points that they may use in field sendee.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">“Conduct Progressive Bible Studies.” Cover material by questions and answers, except paragraph 7. It should be handled as a demonstration showing how to prepare an interested person for opposition from family members, workmates, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Make Plans Now.&quot; Discussion. Show how January Topic for Conversation may be used in placing new book. Pick out points from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book that will be particularly appealing to interested ones. Start with very first weekend of the new year by sharing in the field service. January 2 is first Sunday of the month. Outline specific arrangements for holiday witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 92 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">make wise use of your time in the service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> What can be done if you find very few people at home? Why not call at a different time of day or another day. Some publishers have good success in speaking to people walking along the sidewalk, thus possibly reaching some who were not at home. While engaging in street work it is not good to walk along in twos or threes talking with one another. Rather, separate and approach people so as to start conversations with them. Thus, time is used more effectively and more joy is derived from service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> It is good to remember that our time is a wonderful asset that Jehovah has given us. Let us always use it wisely, not selfishly. Personally consider how you might improve in your own use of time, especially the time set aside for spiritual activities. Continue to walk “not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time” in these last days of Satan’s old system of things.—Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>

After the new student’s second talk, the school overseer can offer commendation on some speech quality that was good and then offer counsel on a point on which the student can work. When a student has a reading assignment, the counsel will not necessarily follow the progressive Speech Counsel slip but may deal with points such as volume, sense stress, pausing or accuracy of statement where explanatory statements are made on texts in the reading assignment. In the case of more experienced students, after offering commendation on an outstanding quality displayed in the presentation, the school overseer may draw attention to a quality that was</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">• What should be done when notes are placed in territory envelopes stating not to call on certain homes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Occasionally we meet householders in our territory who are very opposed to our work and message. Some have even threatened us. If some </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">adamantly request</span><span class="font12"> that none of Jehovah’s Witnesses call at their homes again, such requests should be respected. A note with the name lacking or that needed more attention. Otherwise, the quality shown next on the counsel slip may be referred to and the school overseer would show </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> it was good.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The school overseer will want to give commendation before offering his observation or counsel on a point that needs to be improved or worked on to achieve further progress. A student’s presentation may be so effective that the counselor will simply offer commendation on two speech qualities, showing why they were good.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In counseling, the school overseer will have in mind the immediate need of the student. Depending on whether the slips were marked with a “W&quot; or an “I” following the last assignment, students will know whether to work on developing some particular speech quality or to strive to further improve on that point. In the case of experienced students, if their slips were marked “G” on two points following their last presentation, they may want to have in mind a point that has not yet been marked “G” on the counsel slip when preparing for their next assignment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is hoped that this new -arrangement will help us all to make even greater advancement so that we will be more effective in sharing the truth with others.—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">and address of such a person should be given to the brother assigned to care for the territory. He should also date the note and state on it the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">specific</span><span class="font12"> nature of the difficulty. Thereafter, each publisher who is asked to work this territory should be especially careful to avoid irritating the Householder and not call at his home.—Review </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry of</span><span class="font12"> June 1974, Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, from time to time people move or perhaps experience a change of attitude. Depending on the circumstances, tactful inquiry can be made periodically by a capable publisher to determine the current situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We should not hastily conclude that such notations are required merely because an individual is disturbed or somewhat angry as a result of our calling at an inopportune time. However, where there is a request that we not call again or a need for caution, matters can be handled as outlined above. In this way we protect our brothers and ‘give no cause for stumbling or basis for finding fault with our ministry.’—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With Effective Introductions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Through theocratic education and experience in the Christian ministry, Jehovah gives us “the tongue of the taught ones.” (Isa. 50:4) This enables us to be more discerning in what we say to stimulate interest in the Kingdom message. Whether engaging in house-to-house work or street work, our initial expressions must be choice, reflecting an understanding of people and their varied circumstances.—1 Cor. 9:22, 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOUSE TO HOUSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Unique challenges confront us in the door-to-door ministry as we share Kingdom truths with ‘deserving ones.’ (Matt. 10:11) First of all, approaching a total stranger may be difficult. Behind the doors are persons of differing personalities, circumstances and viewpoints. These factors may have a bearing on our introductory expressions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If your introduction is to carry sufficient impact, advance preparation is required. Several different simple and pointed approaches will allow you to be more flexible. Be discerning, confident and adaptable. Is there anything that shows that the householder may be religiously inclined? Are there indications that children are in the home? Prayerful concentration on these features may aid in determining the direction of your opening remarks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Many publishers have enjoyed encouraging results using any one of the following suggested introductions:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">“In view of the insurmountable problems society is facing, some feel that man’s future on earth is doomed. Despite the increase in family breakdowns, the constant threat of war and other problems, we’re calling this morning to share good news with all persons who would like to have a secure future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Many families today do not feel confident about their future. Increased crime, unemployment and inflation have given rise to extreme depression and insecurity. We have made a special effort to visit you this morning to explain briefly how you and your family can have a bright outlook for the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“We have found that many in our neighborhood welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bible. That is why I am at your door now to discuss the hope it offers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You may find these suggestions effective in your territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our approach to people should . be friendly and conversational. Many publishers choose to begin by offering a free tract or handbill. Using this approach, one overseer said, “This method holds their attention just long enough to get into a Bible conversation.” Why not see if some of these methods will work for you!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STREET WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Street work also calls for both friendly and conversational introductions. People are busy and on the move. In large cities, fear of strangers may be a factor to overcome. There may also be a reluctance to speak in public about religious matters. Keep these things in mind in making your approach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Some publishers make effective use of pointed, thought-provoking questions to get the attention of passersby: “Our streets—will they be safe again?” Or, perhaps, “Will the earth be destroyed?” Keep in mind the need to tailor your question to fit the person and his circumstances. Does his appearance indicate that he is a student, businessman, laborer, and so forth? Try to determine wherein the person’s interest may lie and shape your introduction accordingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Each week many publishers use the early morning hours before work and the lunch hour to share in the witnessing activity. In visiting one local college the publishers pointedly address the students, seeking “opinions on man’s future in the next 5 to 10 years.” Many purposeful discussions have been enjoyed and one brother has already started four studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> We seek Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts to spread the Bible’s comforting message effectively. As we give thoughtful attention to our method and manner of approach, we can confidently expect his spirit to teach us “how to answer the tired one with a word.”—Isa. 50:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Before you can conduct a progressive study, you need to find someone who wants to study. If you are not presently conducting a Bible study, why not talk with those who are and learn from them how to start one. You might go along on. a study to see how the publisher conducts it. This may aid you in conducting a study in a progressive manner, using good teaching methods. Go to Jehovah in prayer, ask him for assistance in starting a study and then follow through in harmony with your prayers. Follow up all the interest you find. Some in the congregation who are particularly adept at starting studies may wish to help by turning some of their studies over to others. Very likely with our new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book, which we will begin placing with the public next month, many studies can be started. If we make practical use of the suggestions given here, those with whom we study may make rapid progress toward serving Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font12"> Sometimes a factor that can block the progress of a Bible student is opposition.

(Matt. 10:34-39; Luke 21:16-19) Help him to have the right attitude toward his persecutors. (Matt. 5:43-48; Rom. 12:17) If the persecution continues, help him to endure by pointing out Scriptural examples of those who</span></p>

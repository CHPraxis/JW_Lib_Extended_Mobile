<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10">B® at Ymir Preaching Urgently</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) With these words Jesus impressed on his disciples the importance of delivering the message of the Kingdom. An urgency was manifested in his words. The end of wickedness could not precede the delivering of this important message. God’s kingdom in the hands of his Son will act decisively against wickedness, but only after this message has been delivered “for a witness to all the nations.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Further highlighting the urgency of preaching, Paul counseled Timothy, “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, . . . do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” Timothy had to apply himself in giving instruction inside the congregation, but ‘evangelizing’ was also necessary. So Paul urged Timothy to ‘fully accomplish his ministry’ by sharing in the preaching work under all circumstances. He was to display the “art of teaching” and yet work with a sense of urgency.—2 Tim. 4:2, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN WE DO IT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Today we are being directed to preach “this good news of the kingdom” and we should be at it</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Benefit Fully from the Circuit Overseer s Visit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> How much we appreciate the visits of our traveling brothers! Truly, they are examples to us all “in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness” just as were Timothy and Titus to the congregations they served. (1 Tim. 4:12) Along with the Memorial and assemblies, the visits of these brothers are truly high points in the service year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> It is good to consider the various ways you can benefit fully from the circuit overseer’s visit. For example, many plan ahead so that they can share in the auxiliary pioneer service during the month of the visit. By spending full days in service with him, not only are auxiliary pioneers greatly encouraged, but they also are assisted in reaching their required hours for the month. Usually a number of interested ones are contacted that week and so there is opportunity for more return visits which may ultimately develop into fine Bible studies. Of course, such urgently. The world scene indicates that the nations are rapidly moving toward their end. Not much time remains to do this pressing work. How can we get on with the preaching work and get it done before the end comes? How can we be good teachers while working with a sense of urgency?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> A fine instrument has been provided by the “faithful and discreet slave” to aid us in getting our urgent work done. It is the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come” </span><span class="font4">We have been offering it along with the Bible during the past two months, and now we have the opportunity to offer this fine publication alone for a contribution of 75c. No doubt you have found it to be very helpful in focusing the attention of the householder on the Kingdom theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Have you been able to use the suggestions given in the last two months? Perhaps you have been able to use the boxes containing pointed information about the Kingdom, such as the one entitled “The Reality of God’s Kingdom” found on page 11. Or, you may have found success using the fine color illustrations in the book, such as the beautiful paradise scene on pages 4 and 5 or the full-page illustrations on pages 148 and 149 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

Review letter “Territory Seldom Worked.” Emphasize how this is a way we can increase our service on a temporary basis. Explain difference between serving where need is greater and working unassigned territory. Encourage brothers to consider working, on a temporary basis, areas that have not been covered in a year or two. (See article, “Step Over into Macedonia and Help” in June, 1980 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.)</span><span class="font4"> Explain how one can apply to work unassigned territory.

<p><span class="font4">this special week of activity. In fact, it is not unusual for a congregation to enjoy new peaks in meeting attendance that week.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, it may be that he will want to sit in on some of the studies that are being conducted with those who have been inactive. If a sister has been assigned to conduct the study, it would be appropriate for the circuit overseer to conduct it on this occasion since it is being held with 'an inactive sister. Both would report the time spent on the study and the return visit would be counted by the publisher who regularly conducts the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The circuit overseer’s visit provides opportunity for us to associate closely with a spiritually older brother and to benefit from his many years of experience in Jehovah’s service. We may also discuss with him any personal problems we have affecting our spirituality. He is in a position to offer fine counsel. We also have the opportunity to enjoy happy fellowship with the circuit overseer and his wife by inviting them to a meal. This association may also help the children in the family to develop greater appreciation for Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATIONAL BENEFITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> The entire congregation also benefits from the assistance the servants receive in caring for their responsibilities. They are aided in offering help to inactive ones and others needing encouragement. Often, the circuit overseer is able to provide encouragement to ill or infirm ones, even visiting them at their home or in the hospital, helping them to face tribulation with greater peace of mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Organizational matters as well as other questions or problems can be discussed with the traveling brother, particularly when he meets with elders and ministerial servants. As these responsible brothers follow through on the good counsel given, the quality of field service should improve. With the round of visits starting this month, the circuit overseer will spend time with the secretary and help him with his duties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Paul, Titus and Timothy set fine examples for traveling overseers todays How grateful we are to have faithful men like these visit our congregations, providing us with the encouragement and help we need to press forward in our ministry. (Phil. 2:22) Be sure to plan ahead so as to benefit fully from the circuit overseer’s visit.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Can They Be Helped?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>x</sup>We were happy to learn from last month’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> that there will be an increased effort during the coming months to help those who have stopped sharing the truth with others. Many of these no longer attend meetings. How grateful we are to Jehovah that he takes such a loving interest in each of us and directs the elders to take the lead in giving the needed help. Even if one has been inactive for many years but has some love for Jehovah, the way is open for him to return to active association with the congregation. Jehovah is patient and does not want any to be destroyed.—2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> As already explained, the secretary and service overseer will be taking the initiative in seeing that inactive ones in the territory are visited. You may be one of the publishers whom the service overseer will ask to help inactive ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PAST BENEFICIAL RESULTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Experience has shown that some will respond to loving efforts to help them come back, even though they have been away for many years and drifted back to some of their former worldly habits. A positive attitude and patience on the part of the publisher calling, along with Jehovah’s help, will bring success if the inactive one still has a love for the truth. If he is dealt with unkindly, there is less likelihood that he will respond.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> For example, a sister who had been away many years felt that Jehovah and the congregation no longer cared for her. A sister called on this ‘lost sheep’ and read selected paragraphs to her from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Learning that Jehovah did still care, the inactive sister began to weep. She had stopped associating due to many family problems and discouragement, wrongly assuming she had been disfellowshipped because of her long absence. This ‘lost sheep’ came to appreciate Jehovah’s mercy and that he was still interested in her. She soon found her way back to active service with the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In another case, where previous efforts had been unfruitful, an elder decided to try one more time to assist an inactive brother to return. He traveled many hours on foot through thornbushes and thick underbrush to reach the brother’s farm. He arrived bruised, scratched and dusty. The elder informed the inactive brother that he had traveled all that way to see how he was doing, and that the congregation was concerned about him. This so moved the brother that he was soon reactivated. A former opposer who was working alongside the inactive brother and listening in on the conversation could not believe what he had heard. He was so impressed by this elder’s efforts to .help the one who had strayed that he and his wife began to study and eventually became active publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> One young married couple had been away from the truth for twelve years. It might have seemed that there was little hope of their returning. An elder decided to make one last try. They had lost their spirituality and were cold toward the brother at first. He maintained a friendly, cheerful disposition and asked them how they came into the truth. This was the turning point. Their attitude warmed and they made rapid progress toward becoming reactivated. He had a positive attitude and did not conclude that there was no hope because of their long absence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP A POSITIVE OUTLOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> These few experiences illustrate that persons who have stopped associating can be helped, often to return. Many who have become inactive are not opposed to the truth but have stopped associating due to personal problems and discouragement. Others may have allowed the “thorns” to choke out the Word because of anxiety and materialism. (Matt. 13:22) Although these may have strayed far and been away for a long time, Jesus’ illustration at Matthew 18:12-14 encourages us always to leave the door open for their return. Many inactive ones can be helped. Jehovah blesses the efforts of those who participate in this work under the direction of the elders.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> In the coming months the secretary and service overseer will determine which inactive ones in the territory would likely respond to help. If you should be asked to study with an inactive one, you may report the time, return visit and Bible study until the individual has completed the study of one book. By that time it is hoped that the person will once again be regular in meeting attendance and field service. It is our sincere prayer that Jehovah will bless richly this special activity, and that many who have gone astray will respond before it is too late.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Witnessing to Prisoners</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Reports have come in from all over the country telling of the good work brothers are doing in contacting prisoners in various jails and penitentiaries, helping some to rehabilitate their lives spiritually. In a number of such institutions regular meetings are being held and several prisoners have studied to the point of dedication and baptism. Their changed pattern of life has been in itself a tremendous witness to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> In some cases, prisoners have been helped by brothers who have corresponded with them over a period of time. There is a danger, though, about which we wish to issue a warning. Some prisoners are willing to carry on correspondence, feigning interest, simply for their own selfish advantage. The love, compassion and generosity of Jehovah’s people sometimes make them an easy mark for such individuals. If correspondence is carried on with a prisoner, it would not be good to begin sending money or material things at the prisoner’s request. Rather, the giving of spiritual information and encouragement to apply Bible principles in his life should be the reason for writing.—Prov. 14:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Since it is not recommended that sisters carry on correspondence with male prisoners, it would be good for such to be done by qualified brothers. It is also ill-advised for members of the congregation to visit the prison indiscriminately and have close association with inmates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Where interest is shown by prisoners, it is good to turn the names and addresses of such ones over to the congregation nearest the prison, and let the brothers qualified to visit the prison contact these prisoners and arrange to study with them if possible. Usually these brothers know what is required and have special permission to enter prison facilities. It is not objectionable for these brothers to hold meetings with prisoners so that several may study at one time. We do not recommend that special events be held in prisons where publishers are invited to mingle with the prisoners indiscriminately. We believe the most good can be accomplished by just holding the regular weekly meeting where they are permitted by the prison officials. Thus, dedicated or interested inmates will be receiving the same spiritual feeding that Jehovah’s people on the outside are receiving.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Certainly we want to be of help to all persons who are hunger-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">[PRESENTING TKIE GOOD KEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">no one was found at home or where the householder has been too busy to listen at th$ time the call was made. If the tract is being left at not-at-homes, make certain that it is placed neatly out of sight of passers-by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> During recent years several tracts have been released and used in special efforts to get a brief message into every home in our territories. This present tract is intended for continuous use in field service. Have you made arrangements to carry a few of these tracts with you at all times so as to be able to use them on every appropriate occasion?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Tracts are particularly convenient for giving to persons we may engage in conversation when traveling, shopping or when going about the daily affairs of life. Several of these tracts may be kept conveniently available in a coat pocket, purse or briefcase. Why not keep a few at your place of employment or among your school books and papers? Having the tract with you may in itself encourage you to be more alert to opportunities to witness informally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Yes, using Bible tracts is a time-tested and effective means of presenting the “good news.” Be sure to pick up a supply soon and use them at every opportunity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT LIES AHEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> It is the coming of God’s kingdom by Christ and knowing what it will do that makes it possible for all praisers of Jehovah to have faith now. So, during these last days of Satan’s system, should we not be moved to speak the “good news” to others so they in turn may have faith and wait for God’s kingdom to remedy earth’s affairs? Surely we will want to make every effort during February to see that we distribute the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come&quot; </span><span class="font4">book to everyone that desires a copy. We should be at our work urgently since the time left to do it is short.—Mark 13:10; 1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Bible Tracts</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Early in the modern history of Jehovah’s Witnesses much of the public witnessing was accomplished through the extensive distribution of Bible tracts. Many first heard the Kingdom message in that way. Today, tracts still play an important role in our public ministry of the “good news.” —Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Last summer at our “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions, Kingdom News No. 30 was released and used from house-to-house in the convention cities. Since that time this new tract, entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Is Planet Earth Near the Brink?</span><span class="font4"> has been made available to congregations for free distribution to the public. (See announcement in the September 1981 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.)</span><span class="font4"> Are you making full use of this new tract?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> This attractive new tract with its thought-provoking title can prove to be most helpful in giving a thorough witness in your territory. Many brothers have effectively used the tract at the beginning of their presentation to catch the eye of the householder. Others prefer using it for stimulating further interest in concluding calls where no literature has been placed.

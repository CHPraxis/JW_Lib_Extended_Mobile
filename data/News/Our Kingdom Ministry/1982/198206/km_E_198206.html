<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Commencing with June and continuing through July we have the opportunity of again using the fine Bible study aid </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font13"> in our field service activity. As was previously announced, arrangements have been made to offer this book along with an older large-size book for a contribution of $1.00. These two months are usually district convention months for us and this means there may be some interference with our regular participation in the field ministry in our home territories due to traveling to and from and attending a district convention. However, that should not prevent our having a share in using this book in our preaching and teaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">- There continue to be various avenues of field service activity open to us whereby we can share with others the timely message in the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.”</span><span class="font13"> The door-to-door ministry, whether in our home territory or at the convention we attend, can include having this publication along with us.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUGGESTED PRESENTATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Note chapter 18 entitled “The Kingdom Triumphant!” On page 174 the introductory words ask: “Will mankind be destroyed off this earth?” Certainly in view of current conditions there are many among our neighbors who ask, or have heard others ask, if this will really happen. It is the type of introduction that may well bring a response from the householder and that could lead into the next two sentences of that opening paragraph which say: “No. And the Kingdom is the reason why.” From thaf. point you can proceed, according to the householder’s reactions, and endeavor to show how this publication answers numerous questions in the minds of people about that kingdom for which many have prayed for so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The first chapter with its delightful picture of paradise-like conditions on pages 4 and 5 also offers an introduction that can be simple but very appealing. Something might be said such as: “I’d like you to look at this very beautiful picture of the kind of world </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Summertime means different things to different persons. For many worldlings, it is a time to ‘plan ahead for the desires of the flesh.’ (Horn. 13:14) Sadly, these usually find that their selfish works do not bring them inner satisfaction and happiness. On the other hand, God’s people find the summer months filled with fine theocratic activities that do bring them much spiritual and physical refreshment. However, to make the most of our opportunities during warmer weather requires careful planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> First on the list of activities this summer there are the “Kingdom Truth” District Conventions. Have you made definite plans to attend, arranging for transportation and accommodations, if necessary? You must make haste because the conventions begin this month. In your convention plans, can you include someone in the congregation needing assistance in</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font13">getting to the convention? This may be a fine way to get better acquainted with a brother or sister you may not know so well. Also, you will likely meet up with old acquaintances at the convention. Would you like to spend time with them? Why not plan to work together in field service following the Friday afternoon session?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Have you been looking forward to a vacation for yourself and your family? This will no doubt -allow you to “rest up a bit” so you can return to your normal routine with renewed vigor and enthusiasm. (Mark 6:31) While being conscious of the need for relaxation, never forget what makes for genuine happiness and contentment—our spirituality. (Matt. 5:3) Arrange to keep your own spirituality and that of your family at a high level during the summer. How might this be done?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">tion often affords a refreshing change where you can enjoy the creative handiwork of Jehovah. This, in itself, can inspire greater appreciation for our Creator. But when this setting is combined with reading the Bible or Bible literature, what a deep impression this can make on our heart and mind and that of our children! (Ps. 19: 1-10) So, whatever you do, be sure to take along ample supplies of •spiritual food for the entire family and remember to use it daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Additionally, many brothers have found that the most memorable vacation experiences were enjoyed when they attended meetings or shared in field service in that area with the local brothers and sisters. They have thus ‘widened out their hearts’ resulting in a greater appreciation and love for the ‘whole association of the brothers.’ (2 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 2:17) Some have arranged to auxiliary pioneer with congregations needing assistance in covering their territory. Other families have made plans to work unassigned territory for two or three weeks or longer. They report that the time thus spent strengthened their family and old, to share in field ministry with magazines on Saturday.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Elders, be alert to plan for summer activities. With children being out of school consider their needs when arranging field service during the week. If various servants will be away, others should be assigned to handle meeting parts, service arrangements and care for other matters. If a book study location will be temporarily unavailable then the householder should notify the conductor in advance so that other arrangements will be made.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">Working Together in Unity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>x</sup>The wise man Solomon wrote that “two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their hard work. For if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up.” (Eccl. 4:9, 10) These words help us to appreciate the need to work together in unity, to be single-minded in purpose so as to accomplish our goal to get along with one another.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s people earth-wide in more than 200 lands and islands have a reputation for working together as one in preaching and teaching the Kingdom good news and in caring for one another’s interests. A Brazilian newspaper said of Jehovah’s Witnesses: “Although there are many imposing religions with their propaganda in all parts of the globe, there does not exist a single one on the face of the earth today that shows the same love and unity as the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> To maintain that unity each one of us must make diligent efforts every day to cultivate the fruits of the spirit in our lives and let the Word of God be our guide in doing so. How can we show we are working with unity of purpose in our regular contacts with one another in meetings at the Kingdom Hall, in field service and on other occasions when we are together? For one thing we must be careful that we do not think too much of ourselves. Paul wrote to the Roman congregation about that matter. (Rom. 12:3) There is a tendency in our human imperfection to feel that only what we think or what we do is right. This leads to disunity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> There are differing abilities and talents among Jehovah’s people. Some have greater aptitude than others in a certain field. But that is no reason for one who is gifted to become proud or haughty; rather it should make him humble and move him to use whatever aptitude or talent he has to benefit as many others as possible. (1 Cor. 4:7) In his letter to the Romans Paul further wrote about varying talents or gifts and showed that whatever abilities one has he is to use such for the benefit of others, and in brotherly love all are to have tender affection for one another. In fact, all Christians are to take the lead in showing honor to one another.—Rom. 12:6-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> What does all of this mean to us within the congregation of Christians where we are now associated? It simply means we need to love one another in spite of our differing abilities. What the Brazilian newspaper said about our love and unity applies to us individually as we make every effort to work shoulder-to-shoulder with one another. We are not in competition but are promoting pure worship together. At times differences may arise. If so, in the spirit of Colos-sians 3:14, 15 settle these quickly so as to maintain unity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s people are not without proper guidance. God’s Word and the many publications of the Society provide the help we need to work and walk together in unity always. Apply in your life what you learn from Jehovah through his organization. Encourage one another by upbuilding conversation. Watch your conduct and set a fine example for your brothers and sisters. We have a grand and important work to do, spreading the good news of the Kingdom in all the earth for a witness. Since “two are better than one,” invite others to share in the Kingdom proclamation. Be regular in attending congregation meetings. Doing all these things will enable us to walk in unity and avoid the divisive spirit that pervades the old world under the control of God’s chief adversary Satan the Devil. Thus we will be following the counsel: “Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.” (Rom. 12:21) As an organization of Jehovah’s zealous workers may we continue to experience the truthfulness of the words of Psalm 133:1: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font12">How should we react to public criticism of the Kingdom work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From time to time apostates and other opposers of the Kingdom message publicly criticize the activity and teachings of Jehovah’s people, using TV and radio programs or articles in newspapers and magazines. Usually the best way to handle such adverse publicity is to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ignore</span><span class="font12"> it, remembering the fine example of Jesus: “When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.’’—1 Pet. 2:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some may feel we should make a public reply to criticism, going on radio or TV to do so or perhaps writing letters to editors, and so forth. However, such action often serves only to publicize further the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">criticism</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">erroneous teachings</span><span class="font12"> of the opposers. Jehovah’s Witnesses are well known in most communities and many people appreciate our service and the fine publications we distribute. Usually any questions about our beliefs and organization which might be raised by public criticism can be answered at the door as we engage in our house-to-house witnessing. Thus, persons with good motives will have their questions answered and we do not provide opposers with additional free publicity. More importantly, the Kingdom good news continues to be preached with a minimum of distraction and disciplemaking goes forward as Jesus directed. —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If the elders in a particular locality feel there should be some public reply to criticism in order to defend Jehovah’s name and people, it is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">always </span><span class="font12">good </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font12"> to contact the Society, giving all the facts about the matter and explaining in full the proposed format of any written or other type of defense that might be proposed. The Society can then consider the matter and offer appropriate suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For further information on this subject please see the following articles: &quot;Replying to Critics’’ in January 1977 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service;</span><span class="font12"> “Should You Retaliate?” in May 22, 1974, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!; </span><span class="font12">and “What Defense Against Defamers of True Christians?” in the November 15, 1976, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Kingdom was the theme of his message for mankind. When speaking about his future presence, he said that one of the outstanding evidences of the nearness of the world’s end would be the preaching of that kingdom in all the world for a witness. Among his last words to the faithful disciples before ascending to heaven were these: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 24:14; 28: 19, 20) So our timely message about the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus, can be enhanced during June and July by effectively using the book, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font13"> and another older large-size book for $1.00. Many will benefit from this Bible-based message as we all make diligent effort to proclaim the Kingdom hope throughout our territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As Well-Trained Youths</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In most congregations of Jehovah’s people around the world there are many young ones associated. What a blessing it is to see youths who are conscious of their spiritual needs and who enjoy attending congregation meetings. (Matt. 5:3, 6) The parents of these children are to be commended for the line training they are giving their children in the spirit of Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But, should such training and discipline include only Bible study and meeting participation? Or should it also include training and participation in the door-to-door ministry? Most of us will agree that children should also become involved in the regular preaching activity. You may recall some excellent Bible examples of youths who were deeply involved in sacred service at a very young age. There was young Samuel, for example, who started temple service right after being </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">weaned</span><span class="font13"> by his mother. Yes, he started his career in sacred sendee at a tender age, comparable to pre-school age today. At first his responsibilities were limited, but they increased as he grew older. (1 Sam. 3:1, 15) Then there was Jephthah’s daughter, who complied with her father’s vow and took up sacred service' at the tabernacle when young. (Judg. 11:36-40) Young Timothy had a fine reputation as a zealous Christian youth. (Acts 16:2) Also, there were the four virgin daughters of the Christian evangelist Philip, and these all ‘prophesied.’ (Acts 21:8, 9) Yes, there are many fine examples in God’s Word of young people who were zealous for Jehovah and interested in taking up the sacred service assigned to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> So today we find many of our young folks zealously presenting the good news from door to door. Truly they are to be commended for their fine efforts. And all of us who are adults, but especially the parents, should take an-interest in encouraging and helping our youth to enjoy Jehovah’s service in the “last days” of this system of things. (2 Tim. 3:1) How can this be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Children should be trained at a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">very early</span><span class="font13"> age to accompany their parents in the field ministry. It seems that sortie parents leave their children behind while they are out in the field service. It may take a little more time and effort to get their children ready and take them along, but parents will find the effort is well worth it.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font13">And it is a part of their parental responsibility. The good example of parents taking the lead in the service cannot be over-emphasized. Taking the children along </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regularly </span><span class="font13">will give them the needed training and should help them to build good habits and to recognize the importance of field service as they grow older.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> What can a parent, or an adult minister, do to assist young ones who accompany him? For one thing, upbuilding conversation can have a fine effect on young ones. Good suggestions on proper behavior while in service are helpful if given in an upbuilding way. Also, help young publishers to appreciate the importance of the preaching activity and show them how they can have a share. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Very young ones can give householders a handbill or a tract. They might also be able to invite people to the Kingdom Hall, perhaps telling them the location and the time of meetings, letting them know they are welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Many young ones especially enjoy witnessing with the magazines. Although quite young, they prepare a brief presentation of the latest issues and offer them for a contribution of 30 cents. They have good results. Those a little older pick out certain articles they have enjoyed reading and highlight these as they present the magazines. In this way, many young publishers have even been able to start magazine routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> When young publishers who read well are working with older persons, invite them to read scriptures at the door. Adult publishers have done this informally or, in some cases, they mention that the youth enjoys going along or is being trained in the ministry. He can even comment on the Bible verse being used in the current Topic for Conversation. If the young publisher is old enough to carry on a” conversation from the Scriptures then it is appropriate for the -adult publisher to greet the householder, explain the purpose of the call, and introduce the young publisher who can then proceed with his presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup>.These are some of the ways in which to help our youth to share in the preaching activity on a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font13"> basis. By getting into the habit of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regularly</span><span class="font13"> participating in the field ministry, they will enjoy it more and more. This is part of the progress they need to make toward personal dedication and</span></p>

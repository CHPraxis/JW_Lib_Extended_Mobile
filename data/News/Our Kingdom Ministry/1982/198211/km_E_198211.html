</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When we witness to people, offer literature, leave tracts and handbills, we are sowing seeds of Kingdom truth. Jesus described our work as similar to that of a farmer sowing seed. (Luke 8:5-8) It is our desire to sow seeds in the hearts of as many as possible. Is that not the way you feel about it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During the month of November we will continue to feature subscriptions to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine or to both. All will want to make good use of these publications as we zealously share in sowing seeds of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Most of us spend a large portion of our service time in the house-to-house work and this is appropriate. We would like to speak with at least someone in each home. However, it is often necessary to call a second or third time to find someone at home. We may witness to others at their places of business or employment. Many publishers regularly engage in street work in an effort to contact still others. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> has encouraged us to approach people working in their</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PEAK OF 613,007 PUBUSHERS IN AUGUST!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In reviewing the 1982 service year, we thank Jehovah by saying in the words of the psalmist: “You have crowned the year with your goodness.” (Ps. 65:11) Considering the many blessings showered upon us, including the new peaks in attendance at the Memorial in April and the district conventions this summer, what a fitting way to close the service year by reaching another publisher peak in August! It represents an 8.8-percent increase over last year’s average and it also exceeds our July peak by 7,193 publishers. Now we look forward to the details of the year’s field service report, not only for the United States but worldwide. Let us continue to show ourselves thankful for all of Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness to us.—Col. 3:15.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Meeting to Fortify Us Spiritually</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>x</sup>Paul said that “solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) The congregation meetings supply solid spiritual food needed to fortify the mind and heart. Thus, the Scriptural command to ‘not forsake the gathering of ourselves together’ should not be minimized. There is good reason for us to obey this inspired direction. —Heb. 10:23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> While you regularly attend all other congregation meetings and participate in them, enjoying and benefiting from these, never underestimate the value of the weekly Congregation Book Study. The fact that this is an organized meeting of a smaller group contributes to its spiritual value. It allows for greater individual participation. gardens or yards as well as to speak to deliverymen and repairmen. Ecclesiastes 11:6 encourages us to ‘sow our seed’ conscientiously because we can never tell where it will take root.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RETURN VISITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The apostle Paul mentioned both planting and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">watering</span><span class="font12"> seeds of truth. (1 Cor. 3:6) This corresponds with Jesus’ command that we </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">teach</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">make disciples</span><span class="font12"> of people. (Matt. 28:19, 20) So, we have a responsibility to call back on receptive individuals and endeavor to water and cultivate the seeds of truth. How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To honest-hearted ones the Kingdom message is good news. The Kingdom will remedy their problems and provide for all of mankind’s needs. So when you call back, show them from the Bible what the Kingdom will accomplish. At the same time endeavor to become acquainted with their concerns and interests. It will help you to determine which of the Kingdom blessings may particular-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is often more time for scriptures to be looked up, read and discussed. Newer ones and children find it easier to participate and they progress quickly as they gain confidence in expressing their faith. Comments made by mature publishers on the more weighty material help to strengthen and fortify all in attendance. The interchange of encouragement at the book study invigorates all who support it, and a closer bond of union results.—Prov. 27:17; Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Beginning the week of December 5 we will be studying portions of the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand!</span><span class="font12"> at our Congregation Book Studies. By all means attend regularly and be prepared to participate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Doing Good to Those With Special Needs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Christians are commanded to “love one another,” to be genuinely interested in others and their wellbeing. (John 13:34; Rom. 15:1, 2) While there is still “time favorable for it” we want to work what is good especially toward those who are related to us in the faith. (Gal. 6:10) The inspired counsel says not to “hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it.”—Prov. 3:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In the Christian congregation there are fatherless boys, older ones, widows, the infirm, depressed, handicapped and others who have special needs. Immediate family members and other relatives should be primarily concerned with assisting these. In imitation of Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ, we should all show concern.—1 Tim. 5:4, 8; Ezek. 34:16; Matt 9:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN WE DO?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What can we do to assist? In some cases a visit and a friendly conversation will lift up their spirits. Or, we may be able to provide a ride to the meetings, invite them to join us in the field ministry, or accompany us on a Bible study we conduct. An older sister or fatherless boy could be invited to our family study and/or a meal. All in the congregation can have a share in assisting those with special needs. Teenagers and children might assist by running errands, doing chores or shopping. Youngsters with only one parent in the truth can start by providing this assistance right at home. There are many ways in which we can and should show genuine Christian love.—Acts 9:39; 1 Pet. 4:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is not unusual for those who are themselves in need to be among the first to respond to the needs of others. In fact, many have found ways they can help themselves. Self-help is a vital factor in a happy, productive Christian life. There are hundreds of pioneers who are physically ill, but they keep busy in the preaching work. Some full-time workers are blind, deaf or in wheelchairs. Many new pioneers being enrolled are older brothers and sisters, some of whom are ill and live alone. Instead of isolating themselves and focusing their attention inward with self-pity, they are optimistic and outgoing. They are intensely occupied in sharing the message of the Kingdom with others. (Acts 18:5) The same can be said for many fatherless boys who have entered the pioneer work, Bethel service or the missionary field. Of course, many of those with special needs are not in a position to undertake the full-time service. Nevertheless, the examples given underscore the spirit that all of us should have and the blessed results.—Mark 10: 28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> There are many things that any of us can do to keep happy and optimistic. We can regularly read the Bible, the magazines and other Society publications; listen to the Bible recordings on cassettes and let the truth fill our hearts; make telephone calls to sick or depressed individuals to encourage them. We can write letters and take the initiative in showing interest in others; set goals such as starting a Bible study or auxiliary pioneering; get to know the brothers better by inviting them over or visiting them. We can improve in our ministry as well as our teaching and speaking ability by enrolling in the Theocratic Ministry School. Brothers can reach out for the privilege of being a servant. (1 Tim. 3:1) The more we work at doing things for others, as well as ourselves, the happier we will be.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> All of us, regardless of personal needs, should clothe ourselves with love and humility. If we have special needs, we should guard against being overly self-conscious or allow pride to cause us to reject loving assistance from our brothers. If we are rendering assistance we should use good judgment and not embarrass or erode the self-respect or dignity of others. None of us should be guilty of abusing the generosity of our brothers or taking advantage of them. We should be positive in our attitude, reasonable, spiritual, rejoicing in our hope. (Phil. 4:4-9) The counsel to ‘love our brothers intensely from the heart’ applies to ALL Christians, because that is a very special need we ALL have. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">—1 Pet, 1:22.</span><span class="font12"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_________</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARE REGULARLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Usually it is best to schedule time regularly for making return visits and endeavoring to start studies. Many are making it a practice to share regularly in the house-to-house work on Sunday. Most have found it best to make their re &gt;&nbsp;urn visits soon after the initial contact. Have you ever made a return visit within a few days, while the interest is still strong? This can be very effective.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The talks will be 45 minutes long. Well-qualified speakers should be used. The material should be properly outlined and presented, not as a summary or a book review, but, as a discourse. There will be no need to read paragraphs from the book, but attention should be drawn to illustrations which fit the material, and should be suitably applied to fit the audience. It will be necessary for each speaker to prepare welt Presentation of the material should be carefully thought out. While developing the main ideas in the chapters assigned, the speaker should clearly emphasize the subject theme.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Speakers can be exchanged with nearby congregations so a speaker may give his talk in more than one congregation if desired. To facilitate this, the dates for beginning the series of talks can be staggered and dates adjusted as needed due to circuit assemblies or the visit of the circuit overseer. Where necessary the talks can run into the month of February.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Invite interested persons to hear these talks with you. Often our mentioning the subject material for the week will help them see the benefit of attending. The talks will help all of us to get better acquainted with the new publication and present it effectively in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It is reported that the business territory of many congregations is worked infrequently. In some cases business territory has not been worked for years. Is this the situation in your congregation? What can be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Many congregations have business establishments throughout their territory. Some are included as a part of the regular house-to-house territories. Hence, publishers may need to be reminded that they are to call also on the business establishments when they work the territory. If some business places are not open or you observe that they are too busy when the territory is first worked, note it down so that calls can be made later at a suitable time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Where there are large business sections, it would be well to have separate business territories for such areas. These can be worked by qualified publishers on a regular basis, just as residential areas are covered.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Regular preparation for the book study and participation in it strengthens us spiritually. (1 Cor. 16:13) Meetings become more interesting and encouraging when we have a part in them. The result is greater joy, satisfaction and spiritual growth. Our participation also serves to encourage and fortify our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To prepare for the book study, each family can best make their own arrangements according to the needs and circumstances. In some families each member individually prepares for the study. Some study a few paragraphs each day as they travel to and from work. To help their children, parents remind and encourage them to prepare for the study. Some families find it beneficial to set aside time to prepare the entire lesson together.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCTOR AND READER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>c</sup> So that all in attendance may receive the greatest benefits from the book study the conductor must be well prepared. (1 Tim. 4:15, 16) Also, since approximately half of the study hour is devoted to reading the paragraphs, a good reader should be assigned beforehand. He should understand the material well and read with appropriate emphasis and clarity. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font12"> June 1980, page 4, Question Box.)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If large sections of business territory cannot be cared for by the congregation, elders should discuss this with the circuit overseer. He can coordinate the efforts of other congregations in the city to get the territory worked by qualified publishers and pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When have you found it best to call on local business establishments? Some have found an early hour on Saturday morning to be a good time, whereas others find it advantageous to call later in the day when they are not so busy or on a weekday when owners are not so occupied.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>c</sup> Those working in business territories should be neatly attired. It is best to keep presentations brief. Some explain that they are calling because businessmen are not usually at home when we call. Use magazines, the current literature offer or tracts. The offer or approach may be varied according to the circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Could your congregation do more to work its business territory? Qualified publishers might be trained to share in this activity. Elders! Can you organize this work so that the good news is presented regularly in all business territory?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> we received direction as to proper dress when attending the book study. It said: “When attending the book study, it would be appropriate to dress as when attending the regular meetings at the Kingdom Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FJELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Wholehearted participation in the ministry is a safeguard for us and strengthens us spiritually. (Rom. 12:11) Our study and participation in meetings produce a desire and zeal to share what we have learned with others. Hence, the location for the book study is usually used as a meeting place for field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Keep fortified by regularly preparing for and attendi’ig ALL congregation meetings. Your participation will strengthen you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 1982</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vol. 25, No. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dear Brothers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How we rejoiced over the article on ‘God’s Ministers’ in the March 15, 1981, issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower! </span><span class="font9">As stated on page 18: “All dedicated and baptized Christians, regardless of sex or age, can be proclaimers, preachers, ministers, . . . provided they give proof thereof by their conduct and their witnessing.” As the apostle Paul did, we, too, desire to ‘glorify our ministry.’ Is that not the way you feel about it? In harmony with the information recently published on this subject, it is most appro-{jriate that the title of this pub-ication now appears as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Have you noticed also the new feature appearing for the first time in the January 8, 1982, issue of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine? </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> will now be carrying articles designed to appeal to those in their teens and early twenties. These articles will discuss questions that are on the minds of young people and can thus be featured in talking with young people in the field. In the January issues the articles are “Is Anything Worth Believing In?” and “Does God Really Care About Me?” Be sure to attend the service meeting the week of January 3 when the use of these articles will be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There were over 41,000 traveling overseers and elders throughout the country who benefited from the Kingdom Ministry School during the past three months. No doubt this should have a stimulating effect on the work during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The field service report for the 1981 service year gives clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on our united activity to his praise. On the average, each month there were 19,995 more publishers in the field than during the preceding service year—an increase of 3.7 percent. And there was a new peak of 588,503 publishers during the month of August! It is also </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Let Your Kingdom Come&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We have all prayed “Let your kingdom come.” What do these words from the Lord’s Prayer mean to you? (Matt. 6:10) Most of us immediately think of things that will affect us personally, such as an end to sickness, death, pollution, or we think of the coming of a paradise earth. (Rev. 21:4; Isa. 65:17) Are there any other reasons why we should want the Kingdom to come?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The coming of God’s kingdom will also mean a perfect government by the King of kings. Jehovah’s sovereignty will be upheld and Satan’s rule ended, A new world society will flourish earth wide. All human endeavors will reflect love of God and neighbor. It will mean the resurrection of billions into a new earth and the waiting arms of their loved ones. (Acts 24:15) That will be a time when the radiant joy of the 144,000 corulers with Christ will be reflected in the billions of Kingdom subjects on earth who are then advancing toward perfection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In appreciation for this bright hope and with an interest in the welfare of others, Jehovah’s people offer “a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips.” (Reb. 13:15) We are moved to carry on our</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Christian Ministers—Imitate David</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup>The Bible account in 1 Samuel chapter 17 helps us to appreciate the confidence that David had in Jehovah even in his youth. His love of Jehovah and his faith were so strong that he was willing to face Goliath. Can you imagine now Jehovah’s heart rejoiced to observe this young man take such a firm stand for true worship?—1 Sam. 17:31-37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Youths today face the challenge of standing fast for pure worship, too. As a Christian youth, you can make Jehovah’s heart glad by imitating David. Your course can give Jehovah a further basis to answer the one taunting him. —Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> While David took the initiative, offering himself in Jehovah’s service, it is important to note that he placed his confidence in Jehovah, not in himself. When approaching Goliath, he said clearly: “I am coming . . . with the name of Jehovah . . . This day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand.” (1 Sam. 17:45, 46) To serve successfully as a young Christian minister, you, too, will need to rely on Jehovah rather than yourself. house-to-house work with joy and earnestness as we seek those who are “sighing and groaning” over the detestable conditions that prevail in the earth. (Ezek. 9:4) When we find them, we see the need to go out of our way, even forgoing personal pleasures if necessary, to help them learn the Kingdom hope and make the necessary changes to become subjects of that government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> During the month of December we encouraged interested persons to obtain copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom. Come”</span><span class="font9"> book and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font9"> Did you meet an interested person who was glad that you called and who accepted the offer? As we continue to make the same offer in January, it may be that, you can do so more easily and effectively now that you have had some experience. Can you help members of your family or others in the congregation to have a share in the work during January? We encourage you to try.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> In addition to the house-to-house work, there are other occasions when we can talk to people about the Kingdom. Have you ever engaged a person in conversation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WILL YOU DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> David said of his Lord: “You have your company of young men just like dewdrops.” (Ps. 110:3) Is it not thrilling to realize that there are hundreds of thousands of young men, “like dewdrops,” who are carrying the refreshing message of truth to others, and there are hundreds of thousands of young women in a ‘large army telling the good news.’? (Ps. 68:11) Yes, it is a thrill and an honor that should always be cherished.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> From personal experience you younger ones know that it requires firm determination on your part to share regularly in the door-to-door ministry. You have no doubt also observed that most people put forth the effort to do what they want to do. So, what will you do when it is time for field service? Will you show that you stand on Jehovah’s side? Will you put forth the effort? Will you show your determination and overcome whatever obstacles are present? You have the ability. If you wanted to share in some other activity, you would do so. So, when </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

Take the initiative to engage others in conversation when this is appropriate. Many people have learned the truth through these methods of preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>s</sup> If you have already been successful in placing the offer with an interested person, do not forget the seeds that have been planted but go back and water them so they will grow.

Call attention to this fine aid so the householder can follow along. This may help him to find answers to other questions he may have.

<div>
<p><span class="font11">“Have Love Among Yourselves”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Most of us are well acquainted with Jesus’ words, “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” In fact, many of us were attracted to the truth because of the love that was shown to us as well as the love we observed being shown among Jehovah’s people. —John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> As dedicated Christians we have many responsibilities that include keeping ourselves and our families well fed spiritually and sharing fully in the preaching work. However, we also have a responsibility to assist our brothers in harmony with their needs.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH'S VIEW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> You will remember Jesus’ parable of the man with a hundred sheep who lost one, searched for it until he found it and then rejoiced greatly that the one lost sheep was found. Jesus said that there is even greater joy in heaven when the one who has strayed is helped to return, than over the 99 that needed no repentance. This illustration helps us to appreciate how Jehovah views matters and the concern he has for those who may have strayed. —Luke 15:3-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Are there some in your congregation who once were active in preaching the good news but who are no longer doing so? Reports indicate that on an average there were three or four in each congregation who became inactive in Jehovah’s service last year. There were also some who were assisted to renew their attendance at meetings and share again in the work of public preaching. Do you know of any who still need such assistance?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN BE DONE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If a member of your family or someone else with whom you are acquainted needs assistance and encouragement, it may be that you can be of help. It is always appropriate to encourage one another to study regularly, attend meetings and share in field service. Perhaps a kind word or an invitation that you </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font9"> to the meetings together or your offering assistance in the service will be just what is needed. Is there a need to remind the person that we must<sup>1</sup> never forget our personal responsibility to live up to our dedication? At times you may locate individuals in your territory who once associated with the congregation and who appreciate the concern we have for them. If so, by all means let one of the elders know about this so assistance can be provided.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> The elders have the responsibility to shepherd the flock, doing so out of love for their brothers. They are especially concerned about those who have become inactive. Brothers who are strong should be helping, in a loving way, those who need to strengthen their resolve to live up to their dedication to Jehovah. Many will respond to such loving concern. —John 21:15-17; Rom. 13:8; 15: 1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> The secretary and the service overseer are interested in doing all they can to arrange for help to be given to inactive ones. They may arrange to visit such ones or invite others in the congregation to do so. It may be that some inactive ones would appreciate having a Bible study conducted with them again. These elders may suggest subjects or the publication that would be most helpful to the individual. They might also determine who would be in the best position to help. Perhaps the inactive one may respond more quickly if the study is conducted by the one who originally helped him. Where an entire family needs help, it may be best for an elder to study with them as a group. An inactive sister may be helped by another sister who is capable and experienced. Younger ones may respond to assistance from a young ministerial servant or capable pioneer. Go to the inactive one and have a friendly conversation. It may take several visits before a study can be started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The ones privileged to conduct such studies will take a real interest in these individuals, helping them to regain their spiritual strength. Encouragement can be given to help such ones to attend the meetings.—Heb. 10:23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Each publisher who conducts such a study may count the time, the return visit and the study until one of the Society’s publications has been completed. Publishers can only report studies and field service time assisting dedicated persons when they have been specifically asked to do so as outlined above, or as described on page 3 in both the February 1977 and August 1981 issues, of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> The service overseer will certainly be interested in the progress of such studies, giving encouragement and making adjustments as necessary. Such progress can. be considered by the elders when they</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Benefit from the Circuit Assembly</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We have received many words of appreciation for the clear and helpful counsel given at our circuit assembly on the theme “Subjecting Ourselves to God.” Do you remember the fine encouragement to recognize our place in Jehovah’s theocratic arrangement and to avoid a course of independence? Surely we will benefit greatly as we heed this counsel ourselves and help our brothers to do so, too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Our next circuit assembly program beginning in February will have as its theme. “Be Blameless as Light Bearers.” (Phil. 2:15) There is a need for all of us to be blameless among a twisted generation and at the same time shine zealously as light bearers. But what does Jehovah require of his light bearers and what pitfalls must we avoid? Be sure that you and your family benefit fully from the fine program that has been prepared.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">encouraging to see that 18,816 arranged their affairs to share in the regular pioneer service, 1,888 more than last year. We spent 5.6 million more hours in the field than last year, placed 2.8 million more magazines and 81,000 more subscriptions. We made 1,9 million more return visits and on the average each month conducted 19,848 more home Bible studies. There were 28,496 baptized, 685 more than last year. And in April there were 1,463,070 who attended the Memorial, 101,458 more than the previous year. Truly, it was a wonderful year to Jehovah’s praise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With you we appreciate the reminder of our year’s text that we be steadfast and unmovable in our worship of Jehovah, We have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord” and pray that Jehovah’s continued blessing will go with us all as we share fully in the work i of Kingdom-preaching during the coming year.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> We are all very much interested in those who have associated with us in the past but who have become inactive in Jehovah’s service. By arranging to study with some of these individuals, we can demonstrate our love and desire to help them again share with us in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By Storting Studies in the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God’s “Kingdom </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">comes </span><span class="font9">to ‘bring to ruin those ruining the earth,’ to provide for the resurrection of the dead, to remove the enemy death and to make our globe a happy, peaceful home for mankind’s habitation.” (Rev. 11:15, 18; 21:1, 3, 4) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(“Kingdom Come” </span><span class="font9">book, page 21, par. 1) Our heartfelt desire is to help those who have received a copy of this book to gain knowledge and appreciation of the Kingdom—the primary theme of the Holy Scriptures. To accomplish this a Bible study usually is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Many brothers who have had success in starting studies say a very simple approach is best. After a friendly greeting, tell the householder you will be brief, but that you wish to demonstrate how he can get the most from the publication. Kindly suggest that he get his book. Turn to the illustration at the beginning of chapter 1 and ask what he finds attractive or appealing in it. (Allow householder to make observations.) Invite him to read the first paragraph, which provides a word description of the illustration. If he declines, you may read it. Thereafter, ask question 1 and allow householder to comment. Have paragraphs 2 and 3 read, followed by the question and discussion, and then proceed with paragraphs 4 and 5. You could also have him read the material in the box on page 7. Ask him if he would like to know what the Kingdom really is and tell him that you will be happy to return next week and consider the matter further with him. When you return, consider the next two pages, which answer the question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Another fine way to get into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font9"> book and start a study is by stating that since childhood most of us have repeated the Lord’s Prayer. You could then repeat the first portion of it asking, “ ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,’ where?” (Allow householder to answer.) If he hesitates or is unable to answer you could continue by stating, “The prayer goes on to say, ‘on earth as it is in heaven.’ ” Then ask the householder what he thinks the earth will be like when God’s will is done on earth. (Allow for comments.) Turn to the illustration in chapter 1 and discuss the conditions God’s kingdom will bring to</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font9">the earth. Have paragraph 1 read, ask the question and discuss. Consider a few paragraphs in this manner and make arrangements to return for further discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Another suggestion is: since so many millions of people pray for the kingdom of God to come, a logical question that many ask is: “What is the Kingdom?” Ask the householder what he thinks about the matter. Then tell him that his book gives the answer. Ask him to get his copy of the book and turn to page 8. Read the subheading and invite the householder to read paragraph 6. Ask the question and discuss. Then have paragraphs 7 and 8 read and discuss. Review what has been learned—that the Kingdom is truly a government. Ask the householder to take time to read the next three pages and assure him that you would be pleased to return on another occasion to consider these matters further with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font9"> book is designed for study and we hope you will be successful in starting many new studies with its aid. It should also be used now, along with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font9"> book, as the two books to be studied with new Bible students. May Jehovah bless your sincere effort to use it well to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Ministers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">it comes to the field service, make necessary adjustments, dress appropriately and share regularly in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>e</sup> Remember, also, that our faithful participation in field service goes further than merely placing magazines or turning in a monthly report. It should give evidence of our devotion to Jehovah and pur love for our neighbor, as well as our firm belief in the good news. Do you really believe that Ged’s kingdom will bring an end to this system shortly and bless all mankind under its righteous rule? Then, show that you believe it by sharing in the ministry and endeavoring to make progress in presenting the message effectively. As you do, you can be sure that Jehovah’s blessing will go with you.</span></p>

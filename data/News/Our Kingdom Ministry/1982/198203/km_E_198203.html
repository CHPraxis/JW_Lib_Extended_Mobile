<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Most Important Day in 1982</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> How much do you value the life of Jesus Christ? Judas valued it as worth no more than the price of a slave. On the other hand, Jehovah viewed his only begotten Son as the most precious of all his creation! His human life was so valuable it could be used to purchase all humankind. (1 John 2:2) This was accomplished by his death, one of the most significant events in the history of mankind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Appropriately, Christians are commanded to remember that event in the manner prescribed by Jesus himself. (1 Cor. 11:23-26) The correct date for this observance has not been lost but is accurately recorded and preserved. This year the Memorial falls on Thursday, April 8, making this the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">most important day in 1982.</span><span class="font14"> What can </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font14"> do to make it the most important day of the year to you? The importance each of us places on the Memorial of Christ’s death will, to a great extent, indicate the value we place on the redemptive sacrifice he made in our behalf. —1 John 5:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DEEPEN APPRECIATION FOR THAT DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In recent years the Society has been suggesting a Bible reading schedule for the week leading up to the Memorial date. The full schedule will appear in the April issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font14">Why not do more than just read the accounts this year? Some like</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Can We Help More to Attend?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Last year on Sunday, April 19, there were 1,463,070 present for the Memorial celebration in the United States. No doubt, the fact that it fell on Sunday, when most people are off from work, helped toward the fine attendance. This year it may not be so convenient for some, but can we aid more to attend? If we put forth a concerted and organized effort we can expect Jehovah’s blessing. The following is suggested:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">2 Week of March 8-14: Start inviting those with whom you are conducting home Bible studies. Following the study it would be a fine thing to use ten to fifteen minutes to explain why all should be present on April 8. Information about the Memorial celebration, who should partake of the emblems and who should not, along with other fine points could be drawn from the articles “ ‘Born Again’— Man’s Part and God’s Part” and “What Prevents Me from Getting Baptized?” in the February 1 and 15 issues of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font14">to pick a time of day when there will be no distractions so they can truly concentrate and meditate on the events that took place in Jesus’ life just prior to his death. Others have found that they can visualize the happenings by closing their eyes while playing those portions of the Society’s Bible tapes covering the suggested verses. (Ps. 63:6) In this way the action comes to life in our mind’s eye and can make a powerful impression, deepening our appreciation. Also, the Society has prepared a new outline that will be used by most Memorial speakers this year. This will provide the same general spiritual refreshment and reminders for the brothers everywhere.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> It is surely an appropriate time also to take stock of our own life course. Has your evaluation of Christ’s sacrifice for </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font14"> moved you to make the necessary changes in your life to gain his approval? The apostle Peter said of Jesus: “He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and five to righteousness.” (1 Pet. 2:24) As we reflect on our life course we may note certain adjustments for the good that need to be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> What about the day we celebrate the Memorial? Some have found they can devote the entire </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 4, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Other points from the articles could be considered in succeeding weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">a Week of March 15-21: Invite relatives to attend the Memorial with you. There are many of our relatives who have never attended a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Explain to them that Jesus encouraged his relatives to hear what he had to say and some of his immediate family became believers such as Mary and his brothers Jude and James.—Acts 1:14; Gal. 1:19; Jude 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">4 W<sup>7</sup>eek of March 22-28: Invite </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> subscribers and those on our magazine routes.

(If none in case of some small congregations, ask those who have been auxiliary pioneers in past to relate experiences and personal impressions of how it helped them.) Were any of those who raised hands housewives with children? If so, interview them on how they plan to get in 60 hours during April and care for their children. If some have older children ask the children how they hope to help parent by doing things at home during month. Will some be taking children along in service or will they be arranging for others to take care of the very young? Do they plan to take a lunch? Let some relate the weekly schedule they plan to follow. Discuss paragraph 3. Are there any who work at a secular job who plan to pioneer in April? What will their schedule be? If there are none, discuss with audience how one who works might manage to spend 60 hours in service. Discuss a tentative schedule. Mention that it is still not too late to enroll for auxiliary pioneering in April. Discuss paragraph 4. Are there any school children who plan to be auxiliary pioneers in April? What schedule do they plan to follow? If no school children have enrolled, discuss a tentative schedule that would allow for 60 hours of service by a student.

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Will You Be an Auxil</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> It is fitting for us to render our “sacrifice of praise” to Jehovah God at every opportunity. (Heb. 13:15; Ps. 44:8) This is especially true during the season when we observe the Memorial of our Lord’s death. (2 Cor. 5:15; 6:1, 2) Can you increase your praise to Jehovah by serving as an auxiliary pioneer in April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Annually, many brothers and sisters seize the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer in April. This is one way to show special appreciation for what Jehovah God has done for us and what Jesus Christ did and is doing for us. (Ps. 145:1, 11, 21) April is a fine month for spending additional time in field service. Also, in April many of us have time off from secular work and school because of the world’s holidays. In April of 1979, an all-time peak of 51,008, almost ten percent of the Kingdom proclaim-ers in the United States branch, shared in the auxiliary pioneer work. What a grand witness to Jehovah God we would give this year if at least ten percent, over 55,000 of us, are auxiliary pioneers in April!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO CAN BE AUXILIARY PIONEERS?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Ask yourself, “Can I be an auxiliary pioneer?” Surely you have thought about it before. Have you ever shared in this work? No doubt many brothers and sisters in circumstances similar to yours have served as auxiliary pioneers. With Jehovah’s help, perhaps you can do it too.—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The enrollment requirements are not difficult. To qualify, you must be baptized, have good morals and a reputation as an exemplary Christian. You should also have made plans that will enable you to devote 60 or more hours in the field ministry during the month. If you qualify, why not request an application, fill it out and return it to the service committee in your congregation? April is an especially fine time to auxiliary pioneer. Youthful publishers who are still attending school can take advantage of the world’s Easter holiday period to engage in the field ministry. Try it. We are confident that you will find the experience enjoyable and spiritually stimulating.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EXPERIENCES OF AUXILIARY PIONEERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Can you be an auxiliary pioneer? Will you be one? These are questions for you to answer. However, the experiences of hundreds of thousands who have been auxiliary pioneers strongly indicate that</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">iary Pioneer in April?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">many others could auxiliary pioneer sometime during the year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> A sister in Florida wrote: “I just wanted to express my appreciation for the auxiliary pioneer arrangement. Although working full-time, I was able to enjoy a fine spiritual boost serving as an auxiliary pioneer. I found witnessing from 5-7 p.m. to be very rewarding as I found many people home and I was able to talk with them, even if only briefly at times. Also, I was thrilled to start a Bible study! The brothers were very supportive and I enjoyed working with many different ones during the month. I hope to benefit from this fine provision again.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> In a number of congregations entire bodies of elders take the lead as auxiliary pioneers at certain times. In California where one body of elders did this, their wives joined them. So did most of the ministerial servants and their wives. When this was announced to the congregation, 26 other publishers also enrolled as auxiliary pioneers for the same month. Can you imagine the joy these 53 brothers and sisters had in the field service and the good results in the territory from this special effort? Their example heightened the congregation’s spirituality, and good effects were felt for many months thereafter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Will you be an auxiliary pioneer in April? Prayerfully consider your circumstances. In this connection, heed Paul’s exhortation: “My beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark10"></a>The Only Cure for Sick Mankind</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> This is the striking title of the special public talk to be given in all congregations throughout the United States on Sunday, March 28. What an appropriate subject to hear discussed just prior to the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal! Yes, the blessings of Kingdom rule all hinge directly on what was accomplished that Friday afternoon, Nisan 14, 33 C.E. God’s name was sanctified and a ransom was provided for all mankind who wish to take advantage of it. On the basis of this loving arrangement God has provided a cure for sick mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Do you not agree that such a provision merits the attention of all? “However, how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?” Those pointed questions directed to the Christians at Rome should reach our hearts as well and move us to preach. (Rom. 10:14) And as we preach during the month of March let us use every opportunity to inform people about the special public talk on March 28, followed by the Memorial of Christ’s death on April 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Special handbills have been provided for both of these events. You may want to use the one advertising the public talk in your house-to-house ministry both in magazine work and when presenting the regular offer. But when calling on relatives, making return visits, inviting those with whom you study or extending an invitation to others showing special interest, it would be good to present the two handbills together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The printed invitations can give the necessary information interested ones need but should be presented along with a warm, personal and sincere request that they attend. So imitate the spirit shown by Lydia when she extended an invitation. Acts 16:15 says she spoke “with entreaty!” To entreat means “to make an earnest request; to persuade.” Did Lydia’s persuading get results? Those who responded said: “She just made us come.” As we display a similar spirit during March and April, encouraging honest-hearted persons to assemble with us, just think of the prospect! No doubt thousands will not only hear but will put faith in Him of whom they have heard and will come in line for the only cure for sick mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As an Auxiliary Pioneer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The month of April will provide many of us with a fine opportunity to serve as auxiliary pioneers. As we thus spend more time in service distributing the special magazines, we will be able to acquaint many persons in the territory with the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Sisters who are housewives may need to make substantial adjustments in their regular schedules. For example, those with children will have to take them and their needs into consideration. The older children might be able to help in making breakfast or caring for other responsibilities around the home, even doing some of the shopping so that mother can have more time for field service. With pre-school children there is often much greater- flexibility. Can they be taken along in service? What about a number of parents taking turns to care for very young children as there may be a need? If automobiles are available for service, could you take along a lunch and eat it in the car to make for better use of time available during the day? Of course, on weekends children out of school can go along in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Those who must work full-time at a secular job would have to make good use of time before and/or after work in order to be auxiliary pioneers in April. Would your employer grant you some adjustments in your daily work hours? Why not consult with him on this? Also plan full days of service on weekends. Get an early start and try to work until late in the day, having in mind contacting the greatest number of persons.</span></p></li>
<li>

What about using recess periods and lunch time for witnessing to others? Some may be able to witness while commuting to and from work or riding on the school bus.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> So regardless of your personal circumstances, strive to have a full share in field service. Utilize those times when you can talk to the greatest number of people. Evenings and weekends are fine times to find people at home. During the daytime on weekdays we may approach them also in business areas or on the streets. Our purpose in spending time in field service is to find and talk to people wherever they may be.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Those who have rural territory may find it best to work things out somewhat differently from those who witness in city territory. If you can enroll as an auxiliary pioneer for April, now is, the time to finalize your plans and turn in your application. May Jehovah bless your careful planning.</span></p></li></ul>

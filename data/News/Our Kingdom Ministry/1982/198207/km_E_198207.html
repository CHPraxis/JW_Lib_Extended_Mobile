<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL-TIME PEAK OF 599,950 PUBLISHERS IN U.S. ATTAINED BY INTENSIFIED ACTIVITY DURING APRIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Outstanding Peaks Also Reached</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Unquestionably, Jehovah’s rich blessings were poured out • upon our united efforts during April. The following reports show that all-time peaks were reached in the categories indicated below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 599,950. This surpasses the previous peak reached in August 1981 by 11,447.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 75,538. Our previous peak was 51,008 reported in April 1979. The report this year represents an increase of 48 percent over the figure three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 10,616,267. Compared with our previous peak, the April report this year shows 57,478 more hours were devoted to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Home Bible Studies: 378,430. Our April report exceeds the March peak by 14,864.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The extra surge of activity that swept through the country in April is powerful evidence that Jehovah’s spirit is operating mightily upon the work of his people. We have every reason to rejoice. How thankful we can be for having exerted ourselves in the ministry! As we go on zealously preaching, may the word of Jehovah keep moving speedily to reach more of those who will listen and join us in praising God.—2 Thess. 3:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Making Wise Use of Our Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During the year 1982 the literature offer for our door-to-door work will have changed eight times. Why do we make these different literature offers? There are many good things that result from this tried and proven arrangement. As a whole, it makes for wise use of our literature.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY WE HAVE CAMPAIGNS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> For one thing, it gives variety to our literature presentations in the field. We meet people of different educational and cultural backgrounds and so, while this month’s literature offer may not appeal to a certain person, it is possible that a future literature offer might. The apostle Paul wrote: “I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.” Our goal is the same as Paul’s. —1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> It also makes for interesting and educational variety for the publisher himself. The change is good for us, personally, in a number of ways. For example,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14">Are You Studying Together as a Family?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Recently a Christian husband who was speaking to an elder said: “I try to conduct a family study regularly but I find it difficult. Sometimes I am guilty of canceling it, or my wife does not feel like studying, or the children have something else to do. Weeks go by without a serious effort being made to get back into the routine of a family study. I know we need the study and any suggestions or help we can get will be appreciated.” Do these comments sound familiar to you? They may since a number of families encounter these and other difficulties when it comes to holding a regular family Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">we get better acquainted with our own literature, having to review its general contents in order to describe it and, in addition, selecting certain paragraphs in order to give specific examples of its benefits. Also, we try to give all persons in the territory a full opportunity to obtain and read the good news in its various forms that all of us cherish and benefit from so much. We all unite in presenting a vital testimony on a timely subject throughout the country. —Acts 20:21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> To add to the variety of literature we offer to the public we should keep in mind the 24 new issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and the 24 new issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> that we make available during the year. Can anyone accuse us of continually “coming around with the same old thing”? Hardly!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ORDERING AND CARING FOR LITERATURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Of course, in order to be able to share fully in these service </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Think about these questions: Why is a regular family study so important and what is its objective? Who should take the lead in conducting the study? What publications can be used? How can the study be kept lively and interesting, especially when children are of different age levels? Why are consistency and devotion so important to regularity of the family study? The Bible and Christian experience provide us with the answers to these questions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PARENTS’ RESPONSIBILITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The Scriptures leave no doubt as to who should take the lead in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">campaigns and offer the literature specified for each month, it will be necessary for the congregation to have that literature on hand. The Society has heard from congregation publishers, pioneers and traveling overseers who say that they are not always able to get the needed literature for that month from, the congregation supply. So, it will be good for the one caring for literature supplies and the service overseer to be aware, some months in advance, of what the coming literature campaigns will consist of, and in this way the needed literature can be ordered well ahead of time. (Compare Proverbs 30:25) What the literature offer is going to be is listed under Announcements in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> usually about three or four months in advance so there is ample time to order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Those responsible for placing the order will want to give careful thought to the quantities needed so that enough literature will be available but not so much as to become overstocked. When the publishers keep themselves informed of what the literature offer is for that month and when the congregation, through its elders and other responsible servants, sees that supplies are adequate, then it is possible to make wise use of our literature.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Yom</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Can Benefit</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Many have expressed pleasure and anticipation since learning that we will use </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness—How to Find It in</span><span class="font4"> the Congregation Book Studies. You may well feel the same. But how can you benefit the most from the study? Or, if you will be conducting the study, what can you do so that all gain the most from this publication?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Recall that when we got the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font4"> book at the Convention we learned that ,it was specially prepared for use with the sort of persons that we often meet today. This was highlighted in a letter from Brazil: “We are so thankful to have the book in Portuguese. It came at the right time, because people today are not so much interested in doctrines as they are in knowing who created us, why, and how they can overcome everyday problems.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The book does cover the major doctrines of the Bible but they are treated in a different fashion compared to other books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> At the book study, then, keeping in mind the book’s design will be important. If you are a book study conductor, you can do much to help by carefully planning your opening comments and closing review of each study. Highlight points such as: What type of persons could be helped with tonight’s material? What main points can you remember so as to use them? How could you begin talking about this subject and then use this chapter—during the house-to-house work? During informal witnessing? How could a Bible study be started in this chapter? What in this chapter will touch the heart or motivate the student?</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font14">Assisting New and Reactivated Publishers in the Field Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup>When you first learned about the need to share in the field ministry likely you were not just given a territory to work and told to preach. No, someone kindly gave you a helping hand and assisted you to get started in this most important work. Would it not be fitting, in turn, to offer your assistance to a new or reactivated one, thus experiencing firsthand that there is “more happiness in giving than there is in receiving”?—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESSIVE ASSISTANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> How would you go about assisting such a person? Of fundamental importance is preparation. You can do this together by discussing either the current Topic for Conversation or some talking points in the literature being offered. It is important for the new or reactivated one to be familiar with the literature being presented in order to feel more comfortable at the door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Another thing that can be done is to discuss common objections that come up and what you would say in response. Why not have practice sessions, taking turns being the householder and raising common objections? This would help to avoid becoming flustered at the door because of an unexpected objection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Your companion may be nervous and unsure of himself at the beginning, so it helps to have a definite appointment to work together. He will appreciate that someone is working with him to help out if the need arises. (Eccl. 4:9, 10) Initially it might be beneficial to work in a territory where it is easier to get into conversations so he can become involved and thus gain confidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Afterward it would be beneficial to discuss the calls made and what could be done to build interest on the next visit. Be positive and commend him for the effort put forth. (1 Thess. 5:11) Endeavor to make a specific appointment to work together again. In time he will develop confidence in his ability not only to present the Kingdom message at the doors, but to express the truth more fully to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> As we progressively work with such ones we can discuss how to use the concordance or the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Topics for Discussion;</span><span class="font4"> how to lay the groundwork for a return visit on the initial call; how to prepare for and to make a return visit; how to start a Bible study and how to improve continually as a teacher. All of these are the important tools and skills of a productive minister.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOK STUDY CONDUCTORS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Each book study conductor should take a personal interest in those in his group so as to notice when someone is missing from the meetings or not doing well in the field ministry. (Prov. 27:23) He should strive to work with as many as possible in the various features of the field service, providing loving assistance when needed or requested. Why not see if you can work with your book study conductor or other capable publishers and benefit from their experience?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> So, “in proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness.” In doing this we do not seek glory for ourselves, but desire that “in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.” As you use these ‘gifts’ to assist others you will be having an added share in glo</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">rifying G</span><span class="font4">od.—1 Pet. 4:10, 11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Family Study &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">teaching the children. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Fathers, </span><span class="font4">... go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” (Eph. 6:4) Fathers should willingly accept their responsibility, yes, even be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">eager</span><span class="font4"> to impart knowledge and counsel to their children. However, if the father is an unbeliever, the believing wife should do her part to teach the children and conduct the family study. (2 Tim. 1:5) Or, due to other circumstances, a sister may have to assume full responsibility for teaching her children. (Prov. 1:8) In other cases an elder or another mature publisher can provide some help, depending on the particular needs in each situation. But such an arrangement should not be used to relieve parents, especially fathers, of their Scriptural responsibility to teach, train and care for their children. —Deut. 6:6, 7; 1 Tim. 3:2, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FLEXIBLE AND INFORMAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Flexibility will help to make the family study practical and stimulating. It may include reading and discussing portions of the Bible together and considering subjects or specific articles from the magazines or other Society publications. Material should be chosen according to the needs of the family. Problems youths face such as peer pressure in school, dating, involvement in school progr</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ams</span><span class="font4">,</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THEOCRATIC NEWS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;0&gt; </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Word has been received that the activities of our brothers in Poland were not adversely affected by events in that country during recent months. Although the curfew and travel restrictions did hamper the movement of people in general, our brothers were able to continue their work of preaching the good news and meeting together in private homes without interference from military patrols. The clear, consistent neutral stand of our brothers has been observed at their places of work and otherwise. Food is rationed and people often have to stand in line to buy their supplies but apparently nobody has really had to go hungry. There is no urgent need for clothing at this time. Travel restrictions have been lifted during the past few months. We are pleased to learn that, considering the overall situation, our brothers have been faring quite well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">sports, selection of music, fads and immoral tendencies can be considered. Repetition of Scriptural principles and viewpoints is beneficial, especially in anticipation of future dangers and temptations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> What are some things that should be taken into consideration when the family study is being conducted? While studies need not be as formal as congregation meetings are, they should be instructive. Make family studies enjoyable, not using the occasion to scold. Encourage the children to comment in their own words, since this will enable them to learn faster. Even if younger ones are not able to appreciate fully or understand everything that is being considered, their presence should be acknowledged and they should be helped to take part in the study. Wise parents give attention to each child’s needs, his comprehension, attention span and his ability to express himself. Family unity and increased spirituality will surely be the result of your diligent and loving efforts.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Why is stick-to-itiveness so important in connection with the family study? Because life has many distractions and things tend to interrupt schedules for study. However, do not allow these to unduly interfere with arrangements for the family study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Regular family Bible study trains and equips children to cope with life's problems. You parents are in the best position to help your children by assuming your God-given responsibility. Surely Jehovah will bless you if you make every effort to hold your family Bible study consistently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To All Kinds of Men</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> One of our chief goals in the field ministry is to reach the hearts of those to whom we preach. The apostle Paul was very effective in doing this. The Bible record shows that he was instrumental, not only in helping many individuals to the Soint of baptism, but also in estab-shing many congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> What contributed to his success? At 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23 we read of one thing he did that should be helpful to us. He wrote: “I have become all things to people of all ^sorts, that I might by all means save some . . . , that I may become a sharer of it with others.” He adapted his approach to the kind of person he was speaking to, whether Jew, or Gentile.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> He found it beneficial to adjust his presentation to suit the personal needs of each one. In that way his hearers would be more receptive to the message. (Prov. 25:11) We can greatly improve our effectiveness in the witness work by following Paul’s example.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE IN ADVANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Before sharing in service some Sublishers go over in their mind ow to vary their approach in speaking with men, women, children, older persons, Jews, Catholics, atheists, evolutionists, and so forth. They consider what can be said that may appeal to the heart of the householder, avoiding that which may unnecessarily offend. They are ready to refer to different pages in the publication (s) being offered to help the householder appreciate that the literature will truly benefit him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> This month we are offering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;‘Kingdom Come”</span><span class="font4"> book. If the householder is concerned about world conditions, we could discuss appropriate information on pages 6 and 7 with him. If the person is upset because God has permitted wickedness, we can refer to chapter 5 and use selected points highlighted at the top of page 44. When witnessing to youths, take advantage of the illustration at the beginning of chapter 1, perhaps discussing the first paragraph as appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Some have found it is helpful to have a variety of publications available which contain information appealing to different types of individuals. These might include books such as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution, Family Life, Great Teacher, Happiness, Truth,</span><span class="font4"> and so forth. Do not hesitate to offer a particular publication whenever you discern that the information it contains has special appeal to the householder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BE ADAPTABLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> When witnessing to all sorts of men, it is best to try to find a common ground, avoiding controversy wherever possible. If you meet a person of the Catholic religion, you may choose to center your Scriptural presentation around Matthew 6:9, 10, referring to the “our Father” prayer, thus using his terminology and appealing to that sort of person. When conversing with Jews, it is often best to use a presentation from the Hebrew Scriptures, like Daniel 2:44. You will note from 1 Corinthians 9:19-21 that the apostle Paul thoughtfully considered the attitudes of those to whom he preached and adjusted his approach accordingly. We will improve our effectiveness and our joy in Jehovah’s service as we show a similar heartfelt concern for those in our territory today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Conf d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Since some chapters are on matters that most brothers know or accept, the study conductor faces a challenge. Can he help all to see the material’s practical value for the ministry? Can he, as a good teacher, aid the brothers to learn </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and remember</span><span class="font4"> lines of reasoning, facts and specific texts to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">use<sup>1</sup>?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> This publication does not have prepared and numbered questions at the bottom of each page to correspond with each paragraph. So when preparing for the study Sive thought to the ‘points for iscussion’ at the bottom of the page. In covering the material in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Happiness</span><span class="font4"> book the study will not be simply a matter of getting answers to specific questions. Rather, there will be opportunity for more discussion, keeping in mind that this is what is often needed with the sort of persons for whom this book is particularly suited. From time to time the conductor will ask an auxiliary question or two.</span></p></li></ul>

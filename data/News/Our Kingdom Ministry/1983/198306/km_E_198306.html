<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">United Supporters of God’s Kingdom</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Our brothers worldwide are united in their support, of God’s Kingdom. They are nof adversely affected by factors that divide worldly groups and organizations, including Christendom. That is why the psalmist stated: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (Ps. 133:1) Jehovah’s people today are experiencing this condition, and during June we will have many opportunities to reflect joy in demonstrating our Christian unity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions scheduled for the United States will be held within a six-week period during the months of June and July. By now all of us should have made plans to attend one of these conventions, and we are no doubt anticipating a rich spiritual feast. (Mal. 3:10) Such gatherings will serve to demonstrate that Jehovah’s Witnesses ar$ a united people. They also provide occasions for us to strengthen the unity of our Christian brotherhood. While listening to the convention program, make note of suggestions given that will strengthen our brothers worldwide.—Eph. 4:3; 1 Cor. 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Not only do we want to attend the “Kingdom Unity” District Con</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">‘How Will They Hear . . . T</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The greatest worldwide Kingdom proclamation ever undertaken will soon draw to a close. (Matt. 24:3, 14; Mark 13:10) Our times are exciting and marked by a sense of urgency as we accomplish our God-given commission. Our ministry should be both </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">progressive</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">expansive</span><span class="font14"> as we consider not only the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">quality</span><span class="font14"> but also the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">quantity of</span><span class="font14"> our service. Why so? Because there are still scores of individuals and families scattered throughout our territories who have not had an opportunity to hear the message of faith. Since “faith follows the thing heard,” how appropriate the question: “How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?” —Rom. 10:14, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> A number of congregations have assigned territory that is not frequently worked. It may be in either distant rural areas or nearby city territory. To work such territory may require not only a little more effort and time but also additional expenditure of money. If your congregation has territory that is worked less frequently than deventions but we want our Bible students and other interested persons to attend as well. Would it not be a cause for joy if all of those who were present at the Memorial celebration this year were also in attendance at the conventions this summer? They could observe firsthand the unity of Jehovah’s people. They would receive information enabling them to take a definite stand for the truth. This is necessary if they are to become united with God’s people in proclaiming the Kingdom message to others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE FULL SHARE IN FIELD MINISTRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> This summer, arrangements will be made for field service on Thursday afternoon, following the conclusion of the session. This will give all the opportunity to share in the field ministry during the early evening. Make plans in advance and invite others to work with you. Family groups especially will want to participate together. Many fine experiences have been enjoyed by those who have shared in it in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In addition, look for opportunities to witness while traveling to the convention each day. Talk to others while at hotels or motels, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2) </span><span class="font14">sired, what can be done to correct this? How can other congregations and traveling overseers help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> With pleasant summer weather ahead, congregations should concentrate on covering all unworked territory. A strong desire to work hard and make careful advance preparation is needed. (Neh. 4:6; 1 Tim. 4:10) Good results are being enjoyed by witnessing with magazines during the late afternoon or early evening hours. Our objective should be to herald the Kingdom message throughout the territory as quickly as possible. Notations can be made only of the interest shown for appropriate follow-through by return visits or letters. Why not organize car groups and plan full days of service, perhaps one weekend out of the month? Get an early start. Driving time can be used to discuss the text and have a practice session along the way. Prepare a lunch to take with you and make the best possible use of the time. Perhaps some could pool their re-</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Note: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer.

<p><span class="font14">8 min: Local announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">10 min: Since many will be attending the district convention or otherwise traveling, it is a good time to look for opportunities to do informal witnessing.

(See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">1983 Yearbook,</span><span class="font14"> pages </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">169, 170</span><span class="font14">.)

On paragraph 7, arrange for a brief demonstration to show how a study might be started using the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The above words fittingly describe not only our new </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book but also the timely arrangement to begin considering this material at the Congregation Book Study this month. No doubt all have read the book through. Hundreds of thousands of copies have been placed in the field during the past few months. It is being used effectively in conducting many home Bible studies. How appropriate it is now for this publication to be used in the Congregation Book Study. Everyone is encouraged to attend regularly each week and enthusiastically share in the joyful feast of spiritual good things.—Matt. 5: 3, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> A reasonable amount of material is being allotted for study each week. This will give everyone, including children, an opportunity to participate freely. Time should be allowed to read and discuss thoroughly some of the key texts. All of us, especially the conductors, should diligently prepare, acquainting ourselves with not merely the answer to each question but also “the reason of things.” (Eccl. 7:25) If we do, each week our group study will result in increased knowledge, understanding and faith.—Prov. 14:6; 2 Pet. 1:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In addition to strengthening our faith, our weekly study will equip us with talking points for use in the field ministry. You may have already developed effective il</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Hear . .. ?' ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">sources, thus sharing the expense so that no one person will be unduly burdened. How fine it is to ‘slave for the furtherance of the good news’!—Phil. 2:22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> There is also much that you can do to aid congregations in your circuit or neighboring ones. The circuit overseer is responsible for coordinating activity to ensure complete coverage of all territory. If you desire to assist, inform the elders and they can contact the circuit overseer to ascertain where a need exists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> All of us can share in this vital work. Families may decide to take a vacation or weekend excursion to an area where the territory needs to be covered. Some car groups might be willing to cover distant areas. Older publishers can be invited even though they may be limited in the number of homes they can work. Those unable to travel a great distance might be able to assist in nearby territory that for some reason has not been worked recently. Think of a way that you, lustrations or enjoyed interesting experiences. At times there may be opportunity to work in helpful field points briefly that will contribute to making the study lively and progressive. The Congregation Book Study should help us to become even more effective teachers. —Compare Proverbs 27:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The book study is also an excellent provision for acquainting our Bible students with Jehovah’s organization. Invite them to attend regularly and experience an interchange of encouragement while also growing in knowledge. (Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10:24, 25) Regular attendance each week will help them to draw closer to the congregation and build faith in God’s Word.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Consider some of the thoughtprovoking subjects for discussion: Chapter 1 contrasts life in this dying old system with the beauty of living in Paradise. We are impressed with its reality! Chapter 4 describes in detail the grandeur of Jehovah, the reasonableness of his existence and the magnificence ,of his personality. Later chapters build on this foundation so that we can develop a personal relationship with Jehovah that will benefit us both now and in the future. This excellent provision will heighten your conviction as to the truths found in the book, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Experienced publishers and new ones alike can enjoy the challenges that accompany Kingdom preaching in such unique circumstances. In some rural areas it may be practical to obtain a detailed county map showing all roadways and the locations of homes. Plan to cover the territory systematically to accomplish the most good in the time available. Cooperation among congregations, zeal for the ministry and good organization of efforts will help toward getting all congregation territory worked at least once a year.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> We all share a responsibility for the lives of people in our territory. (Ezek. 33:6-9) Your call may be one of the last opportunities for ‘those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life’ to become believers. (Acts 13:48) We have been sent forth to preach to all who will hear. So, let us do so “as out of sincerity, yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ.”—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Goal of Starting Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commanded his disciples to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">be preachers.</span><span class="font14"> (Matt. 10:7) A preacher is defined as one who speaks in public, usually offering religious advice. Later, Jesus made it clear that they were to be more than just preachers. They were to become </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">teachers,</span><span class="font14"> ones who show how, train, give lessons. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Preaching would make others aware of the Kingdom message, but in order to make disciples it is necessary to teach, and that means starting and conducting home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Paul told his brothers that they “ought to be teachers in view of the time.” (Heb. 5:12) The present times are critical. We are being trained to be teachers. Have you made progress in this area? Our primary means to teach others is through Bible studies. Are you sharing in this activity? If not, is there more you could do to start a study so that you can share in teaching others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Our attitude largely determines our success. Some say their territory is unresponsive and there is little hope of finding sincere ones who will study. Without realizing it, they may have judged those in their territory as unworthy of help. Yet, we can all recall examples of bitter opposers who have later on accepted the truth.—Gal. 1:13, 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">* All of us would like to find joy in what we do, especially in the disciple-making work. What brings the greatest joy? Not simply an impressive report. Genuine joy comes from helping others. Paul described those whom he had assisted as his “joy.” (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) We find joy in diligently searching for ones who want to know Jehovah. Once we locate them, we will use our abilities to the full to present the message in the most understandable, appealing manner possible. Where there is</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The report for March is a very encouraging one. We reached our seventh consecutive peak in regular pioneers. A total of 413,055 home Bible studies was reported, exceeding the peak in February of this year by 10,456. Let the light continue to shine forth so that others may glorify God as a result of seeing our fine works.—Matt. 5:16. </span><span class="font14">response, our goal is to convey some Scriptural truth that will touch the person’s heart. Keeping a record and making definite plans to return will confirm our sincere concern. This positive mental attitude assures that we, too, will reap “great joy&quot; in our ministry.—Acts 15:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> A positive approach may determine how much we accomplish. If we really </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font14"> to help someone, we can usually find a way. Genuine love does not give up easily. (1 Cor. 13:7) A positive attitude shows we are sincere and convinced that what we have is good. If we offer to study with others and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">mean</span><span class="font14"> it, that in itself may produce a favorable response.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Jesus had a positive mental attitude, He was moved by genuine love for others. (Matt. 9:36) He felt very strongly about doing his work well. (John 4:34) He was convinced that the truth could change people’s lives. (John 8:32) He was willing to sacrifice his own comfort to help them. (Mark 6:31-34) Everything he did in his Father’s service reflected the happiness that he promised would come from giving. (Acts 20: 35) How appropriate that we earnestly ask Jehovah to help us be like Jesus!—1 John 5:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah continues to make fine provisions to help us in the ministry. The book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font14"> is especially designed to help both teacher and student. Its eye-catching appearance makes it easy to place. The material answers many questions that are on the minds of people everywhere. Its concise and simple message is appealing to the heart. Colorful illustrations bring Bible events to life, making a vivid impression on the mind. In what better way could Jehovah answer our request for his aid in becoming teachers? Of course, it is Jehovah who brings the increase and he is due the praise for what is accomplished. However, if we maintain a positive attitude, take advantage of the help he provides and do the best we can with our abilities, then we will receive our own reward as God's fellow workers.—1 Cor. 3: 5-9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">• How should family Bible studies or studies conducted with nonbaptized minor children of dedicated Christians be reported?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Caring for the responsibility to teach children Jehovah’s way requires much time and effort on the part of dedicated Christian parents. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:4) Whether all the time involved is reported as field service has no bearing on the seriousness of the parental responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The congregation’s field service report is compiled to represent primarily what is being accomplished in the field ministry preaching the good news publicly and teaching the truth to persons who are not dedicated and baptized Witnesses. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) However, if a dedicated Christian parent regularly conducts a family Bible study and minor nonbaptized children are involved, he or she may report a total of no more than one hour and one return visit each week that the study is conducted and one home Bible study for the month. This will be the case even if the study is extended for more than one hour at a time or conducted more than once a week. Additional studies or time spent teaching the children individually would not be included in a field service report, but would rather be viewed as an expression of the parent’s earnest desire to train up the children in godly devotion.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What if, for some reason, parents should need help in sounding down the truth into the heart of their children? They may ask others to give them the needed assistance. If another publisher is asked to render such assistance, it would be well to discuss this with the presiding overseer or the service overseer. If the parents are new in the truth or otherwise need help with their children and it would be advisable for another publisher to conduct a Bible study with them, that may be done. In such a case, the one conducting the study would be able to count the time, return visit and study if the children are not baptized.—See “Are You the Only Member of Your Family in the Truth?” in the January 1980 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service </span><span class="font14">and “Working What Is Good Toward Younger Ones” in the August 1980 issue.</span></p>

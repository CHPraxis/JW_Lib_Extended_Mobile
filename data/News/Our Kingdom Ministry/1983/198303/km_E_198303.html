<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Appreciation for the Ransom Provision</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Due to the sin of our forefather Adam, mankind was in need of a redeemer—a perfect man who could buy back what Adam had lost. Our loving Father, Jehovah, came to our aid by sending his only-begotten Son to this earth. The life force of this mighty spirit creature was miraculously transferred to the womb of Mary. In due time Jesus was born. He grew to manhood and, in line with his heavenly Father’s will, gave his perfect life so that we might live. (Matt. 1:20, 21; John 1:1-3, 14) The effect of his sacrifice was precisely the opposite of that of Adam’s sin. —1 Cor. 15:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> True Christians show appreciation for this ransom provision by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and following in his footsteps. We also manifest appreciation by obeying the Scriptural command to attend the annual celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal. (1 Cor. 11:24) This year Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the earth will gather for this celebration after sundown on Tuesday evening, March 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVANCE PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> As outlined in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> last month, elders will want to check carefully to see that necessary advance arrangements have been made. If two or more congregations will be using the same lo</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Abound in Love Toward One Another</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Love is a quality that all true Christians are obligated to have. (1 John 4:11) Within the Christian congregation, brotherly love is being demonstrated. But can we “go on doing it in fuller measure”? —1 Thess. 4:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DEMONSTRATE LOVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Concern and thoughtfulness are qualities that we all appreciate when they are demonstrated toward us. When we show thoughtfulness to our elderly and our infirm brothers we imitate our God, Jehovah, who highly regards “gray-headedness . . . when it is found in the way of righteousness.” (Prov. 16:31) But how cam we show love for these older ones? By picking them up for meetings, visiting them in their home, going shopping for them, running errands, inviting them over to our home for a meal, and so forth. (Gal. 6:10) How about the fatherless boys? Have we shown concern for them lately?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Good manners are always in order for true Christians. How refreshing it was to be reminded, in the September 1982, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Min</span><span class="font11">cation, they will want to coordinate their efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Individually, each one of us will want to take sufficient time to reflect on the significance of this special occasion. Elsewhere in this issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry we</span><span class="font11"> are including a suggested Bible-reading schedule for the week leading up to the Memorial date. All should carefully consider these verses. It is suggested that, if possible, we read this material as family groups. In addition, some have found it helpful to reflect on other printed material such as pages 917-933 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font11"> book, which reviews the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ as well as his works and personal qualities. By prayerfully considering such material we will come to have a better appreciation of the sacredness of the Lord’s Evening Meal and the ransom provision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Having in mind Jesus’ splendid example of wholehearted service, why not schedule some house-to-house activity for earlier in the day? However, be sure to arrange your affairs that day so that you will be alert during the discourse, listening intently to the speaker, concentrating on the information that is presented. Helpful suggestions on the art of listening were given in the May </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 4, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col. 2} istry, of</span><span class="font11"> the need always to manifest good manners! Reviewing this information periodically will help impress it on our mind. Why not discuss it as a family?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah,” says the psalmist. (Ps. 127:3) Thus, parents have a weighty responsibility before Jehovah to train their young ones in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah. (Eph. 6:4) These young ones need to learn how to demonstrate love to one another too. Parents need to remind their children always to be respectful, not to run in the Kingdom Hall or put gum or candy on the chairs or on the floor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Since love is so important' in the life of all of us, we need to demonstrate it to new ones that are coming into Jehovah’s organization. It is only proper that we give them a warm welcome when they visit the Kingdom Hall. When they are shown sincere interest they see that we are following the command to love one another from the heart.

<p><span class="font10">• Questions have been raised as to how long one must wait after a reproof or reinstatement before qualifying for appointment as an auxiliary pioneer.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> A life expectancy of 70 years gives hope of somewhat more than 25,500 days in all. When young, this may seem to be many days, but how quickly they pass! (Ps. 90:10) Even these are not guaranteed to us in this system, as ‘we do not know what our life will be tomorrow.’ (Jas. 4:13-15) Since our days are so few and time is also running out for this world, how appropriate is the prayer of Moses: “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.” (Ps. 90:12) Do you desire Jehovah's help in making the most of each day of your life? Yes, we want to count, or evaluate, our days properly so as to honor Jehovah and benefit our fellow humans.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If we have wasted time in the past, we cannot retrieve it. But we can do something about our future if we plan ahead. Thirty precious days lie before us in April. Now is the time to consider how these days can be used to best advantage. Ask yourself: Will these be good days for me? Will I use them wisely? What will I accomplish? Will I do others lasting good? Will Jehovah God be pleased with my use of these days?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS APRIL?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Many of Jehovah’s people have found that April is an opportune month to auxiliary pioneer. The weather is often mild, and some have time off from secular work and school due to worldly holidays. Do you remember how many auxiliary pioneers we had in April 1982? In anticipation of last April’s activity, the March 1982, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> commented: “What a grand witness to Jehovah God we would give this year if at least ten percent, over 55,000 of us, are auxiliary pioneers in April!” What a happy surprise all of us received when we learned that 75,538—over 13 percent—shared in the auxiliary pioneer service! What a fine response to Jehovah’s invitation! But what will happen in April 1983?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Can you make it your goal to pioneer as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a family</span><span class="font11"> during April? Why not talk it over and make it a subject of your united prayers to Jehovah? We are confident you will find that the blessings far outweigh the effort and the sacrifice made. One year in April an entire family decided to share in the pioneer work. The mother was already a regular pioneer. The father had a full-time job and was serving as an elder. Nevertheless, he saw how he could be an auxiliary pioneer by scheduling time during the evenings and on weekends. The three children had school vacation during the first two weeks of April. During the last two weeks they joined their parents in service after school and on weekends. What were the results? They report: “When the family has one goal—that of trying to help as many 'people as possible within an allotted time— they are all drawn together and there is much more cooperation.” Furthermore, two of the children were thrilled to be able to start Bible studies, and as a family, they devoted 351 hours in Jehovah’s service!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> As a congregation, what will be your goal for April? Can your congregation surpass the number of auxiliary pioneers of last year? It appears that the 60-hour quota is an achievable one for many publishers if all work together and put their faith in Jehovah God to supply “the power beyond what is normal.” (2 Cor. 4:7) One small congregation of 29 publishers rejoiced to have 12 enrolled as auxiliary pioneers. It was not easy for many of them. Some had the added responsibility of serving as elders or ministerial servants. Several sisters had unbelieving husbands and small children. One was a faithful 70-year-old publisher, not in the best of health. When the month ended, was their faith rewarded? All of them had reached their quota of 60 hours and the group actually-averaged 72 hours. During the month they covered their entire territory thoroughly, including not-at-homes, and many other publishers, unable to pioneer, were stimulated to do more. The presiding overseer commented: “This has drawn the congregation closer to Jehovah and to one another.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We recommend that the body of elders include on their elders’ meeting agenda for the month of March a discussion of what can be done to encourage and support the auxiliary pioneer service during April. Some congregations have scheduled additional meetings for service during such special months of activity. For example, besides early morning meetings for service, they have also scheduled afternoon meetings at 3:00 for schoolchildren and then one later around 5:00 p.m. for those who were secularly employed. Also, extra attention may be required to care for the territory and literature needs of those pioneering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH SHOWS US HOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah God shows us how to count our days by providing his example of making good use of time. His days are filled with productive work that benefits his creatures. (John 5: 17) Imitating him can make each day in April a good one for you and those who listen to you. (1 Tim. 4:16) May they be happy days and may Jehovah add days without number to your lifetime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Older Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Truth does not lose its value with age. The truths stored in our heart and mind regarding God’s Kingdom are like priceless treasures, some old, some new. Christ Jesus exhorted his disciples to 'bring out’ these new and old Kingdom truths in their work as •public instructors.’ (Matt. 13:52) Similarly today, Christ’s “faithful and discreet slave” has provided a variety of publications from which we have learned many things regarding the Kingdom. Some are new, some are old; but do you not agree that all our literature contains valuable information that can benefit the public? If so, then you will want to share in bringing out these printed Kingdom truths to the people in your territory during the month of March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’The elders in your congregation will determine what older books are . available and should be featured. They will announce this, and the brother overseeing the literature supplies will make them available to you. Be sure to pick up your supplies from the literature counter if you do not have them already. Bear in mind, though, that whatever literature we offer to the public should be clean and presentable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ When using the Topic for Conversation, “Living Forever—Not Just a Dream!,&quot; how will you present the literature offer? We believe that no matter which publications you offer, somewhere within their pages they will have comments dealing with the prize of everlasting life in a Paradise earth. Take a few moments to review the contents of the books you will present and decide what you will highlight following your Scriptural discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* You may have many booklets in stock. If so, why not make an effort this month to carry some of these in your witnessing bag? If we have the subjects of the booklets in mind we will be ready to offer one of them to a person who manifests interest in a particular subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Would you like to see the persons with whom you study the Bible deepen their Scriptural understanding and knowledge? Why not recommend that they read some of the older books? And, if you are newly associated with Jehovah’s organization and have not read some of these publications yourself, you may wish to add these to your library and read them or use them for reference as you have opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• If the congregation is overstocked with some publications and the elders decide that they will not be used within a reasonable time, then they may let other congregations in the area know what they have. To facilitate this, the circuit overseer can be given a list of the overstocked literature and he can inform other congregations as to what is available. For details regarding transfers of literature from one congregation to another, see page 8 of the current </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Cost List.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ It is our prayer that the many fine books and booklets presently in our home or Kingdom Hall will be brought out and used this month of March to instruct those of the public who want to hear the good news of God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• What two books should be studied with new Bible students?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For some time now we have recommended that those conducting home Bible studies complete two of the Society’s books with the student in order that a full opportunity is provided for the student to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. It was felt that the student should have not only a good understanding of the basic doctrines of the Bible but also a good grasp of what the Bible teaches concerning moral standards, Christian living and related matters. It is felt that this procedure should still continue. We want to do all we can to prepare our students for what lies ahead, providing them with a sound education in Jehovah’s purposes as well as high Christian standards and requirements. If a student is baptized before the study of two books is completed, then it would be good for the study to continue after his baptism. The time, return visits and study can be reported by the publisher until the completion of the second book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the Bible study is being held in the latest book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,</span><span class="font11"> then the second book can be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come.&quot;</span><span class="font11"> If the first book being studied is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come,”</span><span class="font11"> then the second can be the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font11">publication. Of course, in languages in which we do not have the above publications, the brothers will have to use what they have available.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">again individuals have written to the Society, expressing appreciation for the love that was shown to them. Can we “widen out&quot; in our heart to include new ones?—2 Cor. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* When brothers or sisters become seriously ill or have family members in the hospital, how do we respond? Our brotherly love will move us to see how we can support them in their time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Peter writes: “Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8-10) The Greek word rendered “intense” means ‘stretched out.’ The love that we should be demonstrating toward our Christian brothers should not be halfhearted, restricted to doing only what we feel we must do, or what we feel will not inconvenience us. Nor should we limit it to just a favored few in the congregation. We also need to back up our love with Christian deeds that will bring lasting blessings to our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> By thus responding in love we will be giving others much to say about the God that we worship. As an organization, we are doing well in this. How about each one of us individually? If we need to make some improvements, why not do so now? Then we will truly be imitating our loving God, Jehovah, who has shown the greatest love for us.—John 3:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup>We desire that our Bible students and other interested persons be present with us on this sacred occasion. Therefore, during March we will put forth a special effort to contact them personally, making good use of the Society’s printed invitations. You may be able to invite others by telephone or by writing letters. Make arrangements to provide transportation where appropriate and practical. Some have found it helpful to make a list of all interested persons that should be contacted. Once they have been called on, their names can be checked off. Be warmly enthusiastic when inviting these interested ones. Show them the Scriptural significance of this special occasion. Whet their appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’We will want to arrive early on Tuesday evening, if possible, so that we can welcome the new and' the inactive persons who may come. Make them feel at home and introduce them to others. Invite them to the special public talk that is scheduled for April 10. It is hoped that their attendance at the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal will be a stimulus that will encourage them to associate regularly with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> How many of the more than 4 billion people on earth will come to appreciate their opportunity for everlasting life made possible by the ransom, we do not know. But we are assured that “a great crowd” of people will exercise faith in “the blood of the Lamb” and be saved. (Rev. 7: 9, 10, 14) Last year 6,252,787 persons attended the Memorial worldwide! May Jehovah bless our efforts this year as we encourage thousands more to join us in showing appreciation for the ransom provision.</span></p>

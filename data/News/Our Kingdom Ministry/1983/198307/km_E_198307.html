<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Outstanding Increases in Other Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's blessings upon our activity during April were truly bountiful. We greatly rejoice in the following report that shows what was accomplished:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 642,286. This is 27,293 more publishers than our last peak in January 1983.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">/''Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 84,285. An increase of 11.6 percent over the outstanding total of 75,538 for April 1982.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">✓^Regular Pioneers: For the eighth month in a row we have had a peak in regular pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 11,902,964. This is 1,286,697 more than our peak in April a year ago—a 12-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits: 4,048,481. Exceeds our previous peak by 6,311.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: Our fifth peak this service year and 23,445 more than the peak last month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely, ail of this is evidence that Jehovah’s spirit is moving his people to give a tremendous Kingdom witness. As long ago foretold, those having spiritual insight are letting their light shine with ever greater brightness as they turn many to righteousness. (Dan. 12:3) Let us continue to make the most of our privilege to share without letup in this glorious work!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let Your Kingdom Come”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The phrase “Let your kingdom come” is one of the most familiar, but perhaps least understood, passages in the Holy Scriptures. Happily, Jehovah’s Witnesses are blessed with the Biblical understanding of these important words of the Lord’s Prayer.—Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In 1981 at the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions, we received </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Your Kingdom Come,&quot; </span><span class="font13">a 192-page book designed especially to assist us in our vital preaching activity. Since its release just two years ago millions of copies of this book have been produced in many languages for distribution earth wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In July we will continue using this publication in our field service activity. Its timely message will be helpful to us as we carry</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Planning Summer Activities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We know from experience that good results come from wellthought-out plans. (Prov. 20:18; 21:5) Jehovah assures us that he will help us to make our way successful.—Prov. 16:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In planning summer activities, you may find it helpful to review your summer goals and determine which activities should take priority over others. This will be helpful if you find available time is running short. (Luke 14:28-30) Obviously, in establishing priorities, Kingdom interests should be put ahead of other considerations.—Matt. 6:33; 1 Pet. 2:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Among our primary spiritual considerations would be attending and fully benefiting from the rich spiritual program at one of the “Kingdom Unity” District Convenout our commission to preach the “good news of the kingdom.” (Matt. 24:14) How can this book be used effectively in our field ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Why not use a simple introduction? Call attention to the very first chapter, entitled “‘Thy Kingdom Come’!” and the artist’s conception of what life will be like under Kingdom rule. The first two sentences of the opening chapter would serve as an appropriate introduction. There we read: “Few words of prayer have been repeated more often than the above. Perhaps you the reader have uttered that prayer.” From that point you could briefly inform the householder of the contents of the book, referring to the table of contents, and then offer it on a contribution of 75c.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">tions this summer. Joining with our brothers in united worship of Jehovah must be among our first priorities.—Ps. 95:6; 100:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Summer months provide an excellent opportunity to auxiliary pioneer. Young people who are on school vacation are encouraged to spend at least one month this summer as auxiliary pioneers. Why not get other youths interested in working along with those who enroll! Time spent in this way adds to one’s spiritual growth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Some may want to schedule reading the entire Bible during the summer period. When reading the Bible, you may find it helpful to make notes or underline points of interest either for personal appli-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font13"> I)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 80</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements and Question Box. Outline service arrangements for second Saturday and briefly comment on talking points in current magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: “Let Your Kingdom Come.” Question-and-answer coverage of material. Have publisher prepared to demonstrate briefly paragraph 4. Also discuss presentation of the brochure as outlined in paragraph 6, especially showing how it can be helpful to young ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Encouraging talk on “Where Can I Turn When I Have Problems?” from July 8, 1983, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> Also remind brothers to bring along February 8, 1982, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> next week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">12 min: Local announcements and accounts report. Also, consider “1984 Calendar.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Planning Summer Activities.&quot; Question-and-answer discussion of material. As time permits, interview some families and individual publishers, including young ones,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">cation or for future use in the field service. Reading God’s Word is beneficial for everyone.—Ps. 1:2; 2 Tim. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Another priority is to spend a reasonable amount of time in field service, making good use of your Bible knowledge. (Prov. 15:2) It may be possible to assist a nearby congregation in working territory that has not been covered for quite some time. Or how about not-at-homes in your own territory that is covered often? If the same residents are consistently not at home, are not such homes like unworked territory? Make it your personal concern to try different times to approach those who have not been at home. Why not try late afternoon or evening witnessing as a starter? Then try calling on different days. Since so many people subscribe to the worldly view that weekends are for fun, you may find that calls during the week will enable you to reach these people. For those who cannot be found at home regardless of when you call, you might try contacting them by letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ Those who will be taking vacation trips will want to locate the nearest Kingdom Hall so they can regarding their theocratic summertime goals. Are some planning to auxiliary pioneer? Mention various ways to witness informally while traveling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Be Ready Always to Give an Answer. Audience discussion of question sometimes raised in field service: Do Jehovah’s Witnesses believe in miraculous gift of speaking in tongues, or other gifts of the spirit? How can we prepare to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Elder leads discussion based on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid,</span><span class="font13"> page 655 (Gifts of the Spirit) and page 656 (&quot;Tongues”), also February 8, 1982, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> pages 7 to 11. Highlight the following: Gifts of the spirit served to establish early Christian congregation as having God’s approval. (Heb. 2:2-4) Gift of speaking in tongues enabled Christians at Pentecost 33 C.E. to reach foreign-speaking Jews. (Acts, chapter 2) Gifts of spirit transmitted only by an apostle chosen directly by Jesus. (Acts 8:18; 19:6) Thus, with death of the apostles the transmittal of miraculous gifts ceased. Paul foretold cessation of such gifts, including gift of tongues. (1 Cor. 13:8) Those speaking in tongues today usually not understood by others. Apparently not God’s spirit working attend the meetings and share with the congregation in field service. We want to maintain our wholesome, theocratic “routine.” (Phil. 3:16) While visiting other congregations, there will be opportunities to make new theocratic acquaintances. We do enjoy and benefit from ‘widening out’ our affection to include others. (2 Cor. 6:11-13) We can learn much about new ones by listening to their comments and observing the zeal they manifest when in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Some time will properly be set aside for reasonable recreation. (Eccl. 3:4) As to the amount of time scheduled and the type of recreation pursued, one should guard against the negative aspects that the spirit of the world promotes. We know how easy it is for such matters to get out of hand. (1 Tim. 4:8) Many have accepted views such as ‘be good to yourself . . . you deserve it.’ (Luke 12:19) But as we plan our summer activities we do so with the prayerful view of Psalm 90:12. By the time summer ends we will have no cause for regret if we have planned wisely and used our time profitably. We will have a wealth of pleasurable, theocratic memories. through them. Identification marks of love (John 13:35; 1 Cor. 13:13) and separateness from world (John 15: 19) not found in charismatics but in Jehovah’s Witnesses. Witnesses also show love for Jehovah (Matt. 22: 37, 38) and continue with God-given work of making disciples. (Matt. 24: 14; 28:19, 20) Thus prove they are true Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Consider April service report and information on page 1 highlighting new peaks. Encourage congregation to press forward zealously with local activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 62 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 55</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements and appropriate Announcements from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Consider congregation field service report for June. Also encourage all to support magazine activity the fourth Saturday of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">18 min: “Presenting the Good News—With Tact.” Discuss article with questions and answers. Read selected paragraphs and scriptures as time permits. Include comments from audience on how to deal tactfully with circumstances that may arise in the field ministry.</span></p>

As time permits entertain comments from young publishers on what they can do to strengthen this relationship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">18 min: “What Makes a Pioneer?” Question-and-answer discussion of article. Read some paragraphs and scriptures according to time available. Get comments from regular or auxiliary pioneers. How did they arrange their affairs to pioneer? What blessings have they enjoyed by pioneering? Many choose to start regular pioneering in September, so now is a good time to consider it. Get applications from presiding overseer or secretary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What Makes a Pioneer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What makes a pioneer? Individuals answer that question differently. Some may say that pioneers are a unique type of people that seem to have more time available to use in the field ministry. Or they may point to certain health or age advantages, having financial security or secular learning ability, which make it possible to be a pioneer. These may be factors but they do not entirely explain what enables a person to get into the regular pioneer service and what keeps him there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There are many persons with reasonably good health and adequate financial resources who are not pioneers. Yet others who have relatively poor health and limited material means are faithfully sharing in the pioneer work. Could more who are in good health, perhaps retired with a fixed income, or persons temporarily out of work consider regular or auxiliary pioneer service? In the final analysis, individuals whose circumstances permit it become pioneers because they </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font13"> to. That desire is the result of many factors including love, appreciation, zeal and loyalty. When the desire is strong enough, seemingly mountainlike obstacles can be overcome.—Matt. 17:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">’ As a person makes progress in the truth, getting filled with accurate knowledge and exerting himself in the field service, he will experience the joy of helping others to learn the truth. His service takes on meaning and brings a sense of accomplishment. The fruitage of hard work becomes a cause for joy. (Eccl. 2:24) Such good work is the during the first week of August, using the regular Literature Order form (S-14) and indicating the number of English calendars desired under “Controlled Stock Items.” Calendars in other languages should be listed under “Other Language Publications,” showing the quantity for each language separately. Additionally, specify 1984. Do not send the remittance with the order. Calendars are controlled stock items and payment is to be included in the regular remittance sent to the Society following receipt of the calendars. See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List,</span><span class="font13"> paragraphs 20 and 21. Until shipments are made beginning in late October, the 1984 calendar will appear as “Back-ordered&quot; on congregation invoices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">result of cultivating and practicing godly qualities. (2 Pet. 1:5-8) It is from these basic elements that the desire to pioneer springs. (1 Pet, 4:2) The recent all-time peaks in regular pioneers show that many have cultivated this desire.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Those who reach the goal of pioneering and stay in full-time service will receive many added blessings from Jehovah. (Prov. 10:2?) Parents may ask, How can we help our children to cultivate the desire to pioneer? If you can take the lead by pioneering, your children will be encouraged to follow your example. From an early age, train them to become good students of God’s Word. (2 Tim. 3:15) Remember, it has the power to motivate. (Heb. 4: 12) It can teach young people right principles and how to apply them. (Heb. 5:14) Such instruction combined with a good parental example provides a solid basis on which to build.—1 Cor. 3:10-13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">’ Training should include the basic idea of helping people. (Matt. 9:36) Encourage youths and the ones who are new in the truth to follow the example of Jesus in this regard. This will help them to view people as Jehovah does. (2 Pet. 3:9) Show them why helping others is such a vital part of Christian worship.—Matt. 22:39; John 21:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">• Young people of high school age have to consider their long-range goals in life and how they will use their varied resources. Why not aim for pioneering? Older ones who are retired or nearing retirement age can consider pioneering. The way we use our opportunities, makes a big difference in the blessings we receive.—Luke 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ Are you positively trying to make room for regular pioneer ser-vj^e in your life? Are you satisfied with your present priorities? If not, why not reevaluate them? Ask yourself, ‘What is there that prevents </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span class="font13"> from getting into the pioneer service?’ Do you </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font13"> to? (Col. 3:23, 24) If you do, there is a good possibility that you, too, have what it takes to be a pioneer.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As we call. on people in their homes or meet them on the street, in stores or other places, there is a need for us to be tactful. Why? Because we live in the “last days” with their “critical times.” Paul wrote that people living in these days would be “self-assuming,' haughty, . . . not open to any agreement, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . headstrong.” (2 Tim. 3:1-4) So it is apparent that these times call for tactfulness by Jehovah’s people when telling out the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But what is tact? One dictionary definition is: “A keen sense of what to do or say in a difficult or delicate situation in order to maintain good relations with others or avoid offense.&quot; Certainly as Christians we wish to maintain good relations with people and avoid needless offense. So, ’as far as it depends on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">us,</span><span class="font13"> we will be peaceable in word and action with all men?—Rom. 12:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> It helps when we can put ourselves in the position of the person to whom we speak. Perhaps when we call we have interrupted something important. Often the householder is not expecting someone to call at his door. So we have to be tactful, thoughtful, showing deep concern for the individual along with a loving desire to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Paul was a fine example of a tactful Christian witness. Recall that in speaking to the Athenians, he did not berate or condemn them for their idolatry and worship of so many false gods, even though his spirit was irritated by such things. (Acts 17:16) Tactfully Paul used their interest in the worship of many gods as a fine introduction to his speech to the people of Athens.—Acts 17:22-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We too will meet people who have their own religion and will tell us so. What should we do? We must be tactful. We should not be pushy, belligerent or critical. Rather, we should seek to find points of agreement, if possible, and pursue them. There is no need to refute or</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Tactfulness includes being a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">good listener as</span><span class="font13"> well. By listening to and considering the thoughts of a householder, we will know what he is thinking. Often we can tactfully pursue his line of reasoning to develop a good conversation and give a witness. Questions are helpful, but we must be careful that they do not put the householder on the spot. Rather, they should be used to draw him out and get his viewpoint. We can then follow Paul’s example: “I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.” —1 Cor. 9:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> At all times our words must be carefully chosen so as not to give offense. (Prov. 25:11) Then householders will appreciate that we are making </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">friendly</span><span class="font13"> calls with an encouraging message. If our words and facial expression convey personal interest, kindness and friendliness toward all, most people will note this and often respond in a receptive way. Remember Paul’s advice: “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.”—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">• Even when people are definitely not interested, our tactful manner will seek to avoid offense. Thus we can leave a favorable impression and pave the way for the next Witness who calls. Let us continue to present the good news in a tactful way so that we may impart what is good and favorable to those who listen to us.—Eph. 4:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Perhaps you have already developed an approach that is quite appropriate and effective. If so, why not share that with others as you work with them in the ministry? When using this publication, you will be talking about the theme of the Bible, God’s Kingdom, and what it will do for mankind. So the offer is very timely and fits in closely with what our work is all about.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> During July we will also be using the brochure released in 1982 at the “Kingdom Truth” District Conventions. The brochure is entitled </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! </span><span class="font13">This outstanding 32-page publication of magazine size can be a de-• When the service overseer visits a Congregation Book Study group, who conducts the meeting for field service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The service overseer will conduct the meeting for field service. In this way he can set an example for each study conductor as to how to conduct a meaningful meeting for field service based upon the current outline in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Also, he can effectively organize the groups for field service. He will thus demonstrate that in no more than 10 to 15 minutes an informative meeting can be conducted and the group properly organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It would be helpful if the service overseer would make specific arrangements to work with various ones in the Congregation Book Study group. He can give them general encouragement in connection with the field ministry. Likewise he can provide specific suggestions to help them improve the quality of their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The book study conductor and all in the book study group look forward to the visit of the service overseer. They will want to put forth extra effort to give full support to this special week of activity for their study group. In this way they show appreciation for the arrangement by the organization to have the service overseer make meaningful visits to each Congregation Book Study group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">light for young ones and those with limited reading ability. It traces vital Bible history. It presents information from the time of the rebellion in Eden to the time of the restored Paradise on this earth under the Kingdom of God. This illustrated and easy-to-understand brochure, effectively imparts lifegiving knowledge and instruction about Jehovah, his Son Christ Jesus and the promises of the Holy Bible.—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> During July look for opportunities to offer these publications to as many persons as possible. Doubtless thousands more earth wide will yet join with us in unitedly praying, “Let your kingdom come.”</span></p>

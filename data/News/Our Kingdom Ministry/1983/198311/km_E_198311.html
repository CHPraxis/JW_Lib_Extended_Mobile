<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Live Forever in Paradise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 37:29—The Bible says you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:4—What God will do.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Train Your Perceptive Powers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Few, if any, of us get through life without facing momentous decisions. Some decisions seriously affect our future and our happiness, perhaps even our relationship with God. For example: The doctor insists that if you do not have a blood transfusion you will die. Or you are ordered to compromise and break your Christian neutrality. That “nice” worldly boy at school asks you for a date. The coach wants you on the team. Friends invite you to pioneer with them. You. face serious decisions indeed!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When confronted with serious decisions, people react in different ways. Some procrastinate. Others want someone else to shoulder the responsibility of making the decision—perhaps mother, father, a friend, the elders or the Society. Some become physically ill from indecision! But there are others who are prepared to make proper decisions, having had “their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) Paul says these are “mature people.” They have reached the point where they can make mature decisions on serious matters without having others tell them what to do.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PUBLISHER PEAK FOR AUGUST—643,170!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is good to give thanks to Jehovah,” wrote the inspired psalmist. (Ps. 92:1) We have added reason for doing this in view of the fine August service report that closes out the outstanding 1983 service year. The total of 643,170 publishers represents a 10.5-percent increase over last year’s average. The 23,943 regular pioneers for August is a new peak, the ninth during the past service year. Along with the many, many memorable events and blessings of the 1983 service year, the August report strengthens our resolve to keep on declaring the Kingdom good news with even more determination so as to produce fruitage to God's glory.—Phil. 1:11.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Use New Book</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> We were all thrilled this past summer to receive the new book, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship of the Only True God,</span><span class="font12"> when it was released at the “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions. On page 2 of that book the statement is made: &quot;Millions of persons have a knowledge of basic Bible teachings. But to experience to the full the joy of sharing in united worship of the true God, they need to press on to Christian maturity. This book has been prepared to help all such persons to broaden and deepen their understanding of God’s Word and to apply it more fully in their lives.” Since we received this book have we put it into the hands of someone who could benefit from it in that way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It would be a kindness to offer it to anyone with whom you are conducting a home Bible study. Even if some will not be ready to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">How have they been able to do so? Two phrases used by Paul in Hebrews 5:14 that give the clue are: “through use” and “solid food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAINING NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our perceptive powers are trained through use as we feed our minds regularly on the solid spiritual nourishment found in the Bible. In addition, we are helped to make right decisions if we take full advantage of the wholesome provisions from the “discreet slave.” Experience in making right decisions on a day-to-day basis trains us to make proper decisions on more important issues that involve the doing of God’s will.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BIBLICAL EXAMPLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Can you think of individuals mentioned in the Bible who relied on the solid food of God’s Word to aid them in making right decisions? What about Jesus when faced with three temptations at a time when he was weak from 40 days of fasting? In each case Jesus demonstrated that his perceptive powers had been trained to distinguish right and wrong. His ready response to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1}</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>to Help Others</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">study a second book for a number of months, their having the book may whet their appetite. It may also stimulate them to do additional reading, and that can hasten their spiritual growth. You have something good. Do not hold back from sharing it with them.—Prov. 3:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We suggest that you also carry a copy of the bbok when sharing in your regular field ministry. Why? Because tens of millions of copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book have been placed with interested persons. With many, home Bible studies have been conducted. If they continue to show some interest, present this new book, and then offer to study it with them. This is appropriate at any time, regardless of what our regular literature offer for the month may be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As you have observed, the chapters in the new book are each just seven or eight pages in length. That is about right for a Congregation Book Study. But it may prove to be more than you can cover effectively in an hour at a home Bible study. When using this book for study, do not rush through the material. Allow time for the student to look up the scriptures personally and to reason on them. Some paragraphs have a number of scriptures cited; all of them are valuable. If answers given to the study questions are superficial, use auxiliary questions to direct attention to important points that might otherwise be missed. Be sure that the student really understands what is being studied and its value to him personally.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “You ought to be teachers,” Paul wrote to the Hebrews. (Heb. 5:12) That is no less true today as the great teaching assignment given by Jesus reaches its climax.

This applies to the entire publication being studied as well as to a particular chapter and individual paragraphs therein.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The title of a book presents the main theme that is developed. When teaching from that book, the teacher should learn to relate each chapter title to the book title. Help the student to see the relationship between the two. Usually the subject considered in a particular chapter qualifies or deals with a particular aspect of the overall subject. For example, the chapters “Getting Along With One Another in Love&quot; and “Making a Success of Family Life” help the student to see what is required before you can live forever in Paradise on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Subheadings throughout an article or a chapter are helpful in isolating the key points. Each paragraph in a chapter is related in some way to the chapter title. Learn to look for the specific point in each paragraph that is most closely related to the chapter theme. This will be the key point you will want to impress on your student when teaching. Note subheading in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book,</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Finding Joy in</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist has pronounced “happy” the one whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah&quot; and who reads it “in an undertone day and night.” (Ps. 1:1, 2) Do you regularly experience that joy of heart, yes, true happiness, that comes with taking in accurate knowledge of our loving God Jehovah? Many do. But why is it that some find study and meditation a chore, truly hard work that brings great benefits, yes, but not necessarily joy during the process? What can be done to turn this seeming chore into a joyful experience?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN WE INCREASE OUR JOY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> First we must appreciate that taking in such knowledge actually </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">means life</span><span class="font12"> for us. (John 17:3) So important is this that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> once stated: “If you ‘cannot find time’ for Bible study, then you are, in effect, saying that you do not want life.” But should the gaining of everlasting life be the sole motive of our Bible study? Note Jesus’ an-page 120 and paragraphs 4 and 5 that follow.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When teaching from a publication with printed questions, you will usually find that the answer is to be found in one simple phrase, and sometimes in a single word. Teach your student to confine his underlining to that single word or phrase. This has several advantages. He can spot the answer quickly without having to reread much of the paragraph. Encourage him to phrase answers in his own words rather than reading from lengthy portions he may have underlined. By looking at the few underlined words, he can quickly formulate a mental outline of what the material is all about.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Of special value to the teacher and to the student is the use of italics, which highlight key words and phrases in a paragraph or key portions of Scripture texts. Be sure your student understands the application that is made of the italicized material. This will be helpful to him when explaining his beliefs to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> These basic ideas dealing with key points are applicable whether one is teaching as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">Study conductor, as a Book Study conductor or on a home Bible study, as well as when teaching children. Jesus said we should ‘make disciples, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">teaching them.'</span><span class="font12"> (Matt. 28:19, 20) Learning to make the key points stand out will help us to carry out that commission.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Personal Study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">swer to those Jewish leaders seeking to kill him: “You are searching the Scriptures, because you think that by means of them you will have everlasting life; . . . but I well know that you do not have the love of God in you.” (John 5:39, 42) Yes, our personal study must be motivated by a love for God and a desire to help others.—Acts 20:35; 1 Cor. 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For instance, by preparing thoroughly for all congregation meetings, we will be more inclined to participate, and our comments will be more meaningful. In this way we can encourage and incite others to love and fine works. (Heb. 10:24, 25) And how will this affect our field ministry? Our advance preparation for meetings will impress more deeply upon our minds the spiritual truths we learn at the Kingdom Hall, and thus we will be able to recall these points when witnessing to others. We will be better equipped in all </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page if, col.</span><span class="font12"> I)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Calling Back on Subscribers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> November is now the second month of our current </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription campaign. Undoubtedly many individuals became new subscribers during October, and it is good for us to follow up and see if a Bible study might be started. How may we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Most of these new subscribers will not be receiving their magazines in the mail as yet, so we could call back with the latest issues. After several of such visits a friendship begins to develop. A good conversation can often be started on the basis of one or two articles that may appeal to the new subscriber. The key is to know the magazines well and make the visit a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">friendly</span><span class="font12"> one. Let the subscriber see that you are interested in him and that the information you have is vital to his welfare and happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Remember, our objective with subscribers is to start a Bible study. Their having information is not enough. The eunuch had the book of Isaiah but he needed Philip to explain it. (Acts 8:27-36) Philip used the direct approach, and a productive Bible study was held immediately. Why not try the same with subscribers? Whether this initial effort is successful or not, make a definite offer to return and study the Bible with the individual. Here is one way it could be done:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As subscribers, we will know approximately when the issues are received through the mail. So we could call within a few days and point out interesting articles in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Study &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d}</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">features of service to offer to others 'a reason for the hope within us,’ and our ministry will be much more effective.—r Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FINDING THE TIME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">finding</span><span class="font12"> study time a problem? If we appreciate that Bible study actually means our life, and if we sincerely desire to use what we learn to benefit others, we will be moved to ‘buy out time’ from less important activities. (Eph. 5:15, 16) It may require limiting our television viewing or our reading of nonessential material. Perhaps we could make better use of some time in the evening just before retiring, or we could rise a little earlier in the morning. Even 15 or 20 minutes each day used in this way is beneficial, especially when latest issues. Sometimes it is good to sit down with the subscriber and read a few paragraphs together, where this is possible. Such friendly discussions can often lead to a home Bible study’s being developed in time. In making such a call, one could greet the fellow subscriber warmly and then say something like this: “I know you must have just received your [issue date] </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> [or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!] </span><span class="font12">in the mail, as I have just received mine, and I thought of you when I read this article. [Show title.] If you have your copy nearby, I would like to show you a point that really interested me.” Such calls, while brief, could be made longer and include further discussion as a friendship builds up. Eventually the householder is looking forward to his weekly Bible discussion with your help. When the time is appropriate a study may be started in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We hope you will have good success in obtaining subscriptions and then in starting studies with these individuals who show interest in God’s Word. Remember, we want to help them become true disciples of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Be friendly on your calls; let people know you are genuinely interested in them and their family. Help them to she how the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines they receive will further improve their knowledge of God and his purposes. At the appropriate time offer to study with them and then be dependable in making your calls to assist them in taking in the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. —John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">done </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">regularly.</span><span class="font12"> Just 15 minutes of personal study </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">every day</span><span class="font12"> adds up to more than 91 hours in a year’s time!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> But for us to reap the fullest joy from our periods of study, we must use the time well. We should avoid daydreaming or letting our mind wander, but, rather, focus our thoughts on a specific subject. By setting a goal and removing ourselves from distractions such as the television or a noisy room, we will be more productive. Real personal study requires thoughtful meditation on the practical value of what we are learning. If we follow Paul’s advice to “ponder over these things; be absorbed in them,” we will feel satisfied with what we are able to accomplish and will find real joy in personal study.—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li></ul>

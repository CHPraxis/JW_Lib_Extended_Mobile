</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> We are living at a time of abounding increase in true worship. As the divinely authorized marking work foretold for these last days rapidly moves toward its completion, honest-hearted ones everywhere are responding to the good news. They conform to Jehovah’s righteous standards and dedicate their life to him. They, in turn, are striving to have a full share in helping still others to become marked for salvation. —Ezek. 9:2-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Some of us have been sharing in this prophesied work for 5, 10, 20, 40 or more years. Others have been added to the ranks of ministers of the good news more recently. But individually we all do well to ask ourselves from time to time, ‘How do I feel about my privilege of being a Kingdom minister today?’ Also, we could ask: ‘Do I still view the work of the ministry with a sense of urgency?’ Are we individually concerned with increasing our share in the divinely authorized work?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE OF THE ‘FAITHFUL SLAVE’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> “The faithful and discreet slave” continues to take the lead in moving ahead with this work. Year after year missionaries are sent out to expand this marking work in many parts of the earth. The house-to-house ministry and other features of service are used to accomplish the preaching of</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Working in the Harvest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Harvesttime is a time for work. When the crop is ripe, the harvest must begin. Any delay can result in serious loss. Everyone is asked to help, including women and children. Other tasks of less importance are temporarily set aside. Each day’s work may start before the sun comes up and often extends late into the evening. Even so, harvesttime brings great rejoicing.—Isa. 9:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Likewise, spiritual harvesttime calls for much v^ork. Jesus pointed this out when he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9: 37, 38) In addition to bringing more workers into the field, some of those already serving may be able to spend additional time working in the field. In the modern spiritual harvesting work many have responded to the need in the field by enrolling for one or more months as auxiliary pioneers. Their reward has been increased proportionately as they have located in-the good news. New publications are made available and we are instructed on how to use them effectively.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> One example is the new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font14"> We have now had time to read it carefully. At recent Service Meetings we have discussed the contents and received timely suggestions on how to offer it. We have also benefited greatly from the talks based on this new book. Surely all such timely instruction, practical assistance and encouragement have moved us to want to increase our share in the divinely authorized marking work. We all want to use this fine new publication to good advantage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Now we have had one full month of offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book from house to house and we are continuing with this same offer during February. Will we all take advantage of every opportunity during this short winter month and further increase our share in the ministry? In those areas where inclement weather may make regular house-to-house witnessing difficult, why not expand our ministry in business territory, or work apartment buildings and call back on not-at-homes listed on our house-to-house records? Depending on local circumstances, we may be</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">terested ones and have even begun studies with some of them. It has been extra work, but they are “filled with joy” as they share in reaping a bountiful harvest of new disciples. —Acts 13:48, 52.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The auxiliary pioneer service has opened the way for many to increase their share in the harvest work. It only takes an average of about two hours per day in Kingdom service to meet the auxiliary pioneer requirements. Some have been able to arrange to spend less time at their secular work. In some schools, students have been permitted to schedule classes in order to be dismissed early in the day. Others have made good use of holidays and vacation periods. Many housewives have found it possible to share in the auxiliary pioneer service by simply budgeting their time and having the cooperation of the family. Many are receiving blessings because of making the necessary adjustments.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Some of us may be able to increase the amount of time we spend in the field ministry. We may be able to enroll as auxiliary pioneers for a month or longer. This would help prepare us for the special activity planned for March and April. Pioneers usually spend more time in the field during those months. Vacation periods may be used to good advantage to increase our time in field service. And then what about planning to spend some extra time in the ministry during the visit of the circuit overseer? He and his wife will appreciate the support and we will personally benefit. But whether serving as regular pioneers, auxiliary pioneers or congregation publishers, the important question is: Are we endeavoring to do all we can to help others to become marked for life in Paradise?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Even if other obligations do not permit us to spend more hours preaching and teaching, can we still increase our effectiveness in the field through more efficient use of the time we do spend in the ministry? Let us take full advantage of all theocratic training arrangements in the congregation, seek Jehovah’s assistance through prayer and remain optimistic about the possibilities of increasing our share in the divinely authorized marking work.—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">“Working in the Harvest as an Auxiliary Pioneer.” Questions and answers. Read selected paragraphs as time allows. Interview some who are auxiliary pioneers this month, or who plan to enroll for March or April, and get suggestions from them as to how it can be done. Call attention to all-time peak of auxiliary pioneers in April 1982. Note </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry of </span><span class="font12">July 1982, page 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> One sister writes: “As a housewife and mother, I have been able to enjoy auxiliary pioneering and it has been spiritually upbuilding to me and my family.” A 15-year-old schoolgirl tells of using her two-week spring vacation to share in the auxiliary pioneer service, and says: “I can really see the difference, especially an improvement in conversation. My results are outstanding, and I was able to hold many more conversations with people at the door.” Another Witness wrote: “Auxiliary pioneering has caused me to develop more love in my heart for the dying human race.” •</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> As you make your plans, why not talk with others who have successfully pioneered, to get the benefit of their experience? Also, it is always beneficial to go to Jehovah in prayer, asking for his help. We need both spiritual and physical strength for the work, and this he imparts to all who offer themselves willingly. (Isa. 40:29-31) We can ask him for wisdom to say and do the right things and for his spirit to sustain us.—Jas. 1:5; Luke 11:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> How privileged we are to be living in the spiritual harvesttime near the end of this old system! The requirements of the harvest may draw heavily on our time and energy, yet our shaving a share rewards us with a surpassing joy. Efforts to increase our participation in the disciple-making work through auxiliary pioneer service will bring Jehovah’s blessing.—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Showing hospitality is rewarding to both the giver and the receiver. It is a Christian obligation. (Heb. 13:2) Some are now in the truth due partly to the good influence that Christian hospitality had on them. Do you demonstrate genuine hospitality? Are you seeking ways to improve in doing so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Hospitality is defined as “the cordial and generous reception and entertainment of guests or strangers.” The word “cordial” comes from a Latin word that relates to the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">heart. </span><span class="font14">So for hospitality to be genuine and rewarding it must come from the heart. Like Lydia, a genuinely hospitable person just ‘makes the guest come.’ (Acts 16:14, 15) Truly hospitable people look for opportunities to extend kindness to others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW IT IS SHOWN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> How can we show hospitality? To whom can it be shown? Hospitality was shown, in ancient times, to prophets and special servants of God. Some even entertained angels because of manifesting the spirit of hospitality. (Gen. 18:3, 8) Imagine the rewards received by Zacchaeus, Martha, Mary and Lazarus because they displayed human kindness to Jesus! (Luke 19:5-10; 10:38-42) In our day many have similarly been blessed by being hospitable to traveling overseers, visiting speakers, pioneers and missionaries.—Rom. 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Also, there are new ones in the congregation who will benefit from our hospitality. Some in the congregation may be shy. Others may be of little means, while still others are advanced in age or failing in health. Some youths do not have parents in the truth. What effect would it have on them if they were invited into our home for a meal, some form of wholesome recreation or to join in a period of study? Remember the wise advice of Jesus at Luke 14:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Our displaying hospitality should not be limited to those associated with the congregation. Do we respond hospitably when our neighbors are in need due to an accident, sickness or a death in the family? Do we take advantage of opportunities to extend hospitality to relatives? We should be balanced and use good judgment in devoting precious time to these things; maybe we could use such opportunities to give them an informal witness or words of encouragement, in addition to possibly helping in other ways.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REWARDS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Showing Christian hospitality takes time and effort. But this giv-ing of ourselves helps to identify us as Christ’s disciples. (John 13:35) Jehovah wants us to be givers. We get more satisfaction and happiness from giving than from receiving. (Acts 20: 35) Although extra work is involved, we want to have in mind that work is a gift from God. (Eccl. 3:13) The generous soul can expect a reward for his cordial giving.—Prov. 11:25; Luke 6:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> We experience deep joy when we see that our Christian hospitality has influenced someone to have a full share in the more important giving, Kingdom preaching. What satisfaction will be ours if we observe ones to whom we were hospitable partaking of Jehovah’s eternal provisions in the New Order! Yes, demonstrating hospitality to others can be eternally rewarding to both the givers and the receivers.—Matt. 25:34-40.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Is it not thrilling to know that thousands have already accepted the new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth?</span><span class="font14"> Every indication is that this Bible study aid will prove to be a most valuable instrument for use in the field as the ingathering continues.—Isa. 60:8, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> But placing the book is only the first step. There must be a meaningful follow-up with return visits and progressive home Bible studies. Since the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book is designed for conducting Bible studies, we can approach this work enthusiastically and with confidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Do not delay calling back on interested people. Although they may have accepted the book, pressures of everyday living and resultant anxieties can cause interest to fade rapidly, even as illustrated in Jesus’ parable of the sower. (Matt. 13:18-23) It may take several return visits to get a study started with some individuals, but many publishers still obtain good results by offering a free home Bible study on the very first visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> But how might interest in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book be developed into a Bible study? You might say: “This book answers many of the basic questions that people often ask about God and the Bible. For example, many religions teach that hell is a place of eternal fiery torment for the wicked. What is your personal belief on this point? [Allow response.] Sincere persons have been surprised to learn that God’s own Son, Jesus Christ, went to hell! [Using a copy of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version,</span><span class="font14"> read and discuss Acts 2:31.] Can you see that if we accept this common view of hell, then we are forced to believe that God’s perfect Son, Jesus, was wicked? Obviously that would make God’s Word a lie. On the other hand, you may be interested in learning the Bible’s truthful answer to the question What Kind of Place Is Hell?’ ” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Live Forever,</span><span class="font14"> page 81) At this point some publishers like to exchange books with the householder, allowing ■ him to use a book with the answers marked. After considering the first three paragraphs, draw attention to the difference between their book and yours, showing the advantage and necessity of preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Another approach might be: “Have you ever thought about living forever? [Allow response.] Of course, many would not relish the thought of doing so in view of the suffering, violence and hunger that already plague us.” While turning to pages 11-13, you might say: “But suppose you could live forever under conditions like these—would not that be pleasurable? [Allow response.] To do so, however, requires something of us. Notice what paragraph 19 says. [Read.] Let me demonstrate how this book is designed to help you do just that.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Have you already placed one or more of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> books? If so, do not fail to call back and follow up the interest you have found. You will no doubt find that the many excellent features of this book will make it easy for you to start and conduct a progressive home Bible study even if you have never conducted a study before. Ask Jehovah to help you, and then do your part in putting this fine new Bible study aid to good use in helping someone else to learn of the hope of living forever in Paradise on earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question SBox</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">O What factors should be considered in selecting homes for use as book study locations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What a fine privilege it is to have a Congregation Book Study in one’s home! The book study is an extension of the congregation and is appropriately viewed as a part of Jehovah’s arrangement to instruct his people. At times, new or additional locations are needed due to some homes no longer being available or due to expansion. Any in the congregation who desire to volunteer their home as a book study location should inform the elders. Even if your home is not chosen, you can be confident that your offer was greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Besides considering the convenience of location, the elders should also give some thought to the matter of safety. After choosing what appear to be the best locations, arrange for and encourage the brothers to travel together so as to assist one another. We are always grateful for whatever accommodations the brothers are able to provide. Good judgment should be exercised to see that the Congregation Book Studies are in the best possible locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The home that is neat and orderly is always appreciated. When there is sufficient light and ventilation, this is good. (Acts 20:8) The family whose home is used should</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Plans</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> On Tuesday, March 29, after sundown, we expect upwards of a million and a half people to meet with us in the United States to commemorate the most important event that ever took place on earth. This is the Memorial of the death of Jesus. (Luke 22:19) Are we planning now in such a way as to demonstrate our appreciation for the significance of that event?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Here is a list of some things to be cared for in advance (1 Cor. 14:40):</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">(1) Are there any special needs for cleaning and repairs so that the Kingdom Hall will reflect well on the importance of the occasion?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(2) Is there need for adjustments or additions to the seating arrangements?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(3) Has someone been assigned to obtain the bread and the wine? Also, have the attendants and brothers who will serve the Memorial emblems been assigned and instructed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(4) Final arrangements for the Memorial speaker.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(5) Reminders to all to invite relatives, Bible students, inactive ones and others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">(6) Encouragement for all to increase personal field service activity and, for those who can, to enroll as auxiliary pioneers during the months of March and April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> It was pleasurable to see the response to the Memorial in 1982. We had an all-time peak attendance of 1,499,284. In April we also had an all-time peak in auxiliary pioneers of over 75,000. What will 1983 bring? May Jehovah bless our diligent efforts as we plan for this most important event.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Living Forever—Not Just a Dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 37:29—Man created to live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 55:11—Why we can believe.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Use New Book in Proclaiming Kingdom Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How did we feel when we first started taking in an accurate knowledge of the truth? It was a delightful experience—an undeserved kindness from Jehovah. We felt as did the two disciples to whom Jesus miraculously appeared on the road to Emmaus. According to Luke 24:32 they said to each other: “Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?” Yes, our hearts, too, were filled with appreciation as the meaning of the Scriptures was first opened up to us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> But we were not given the truth for just our own benefit. ‘How will they hear without someone to preach?’ asks the apostle Paul. (Rom. 10:14) The answer comes from more than 2 million of Jehovah’s people, who want to be like Isaiah and say: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) Now is the time for Kingdom truth to be proclaimed far and wide. We should feel responsible for doing this in the territory assigned to our congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Something that will help us proclaim Kingdom truth in our territory during January and February is the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font12"> We have been waiting to offer it from door to door and now the opportunity is</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Assisting Others Through the Congregation Book Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Early Christians met in homes in order to worship Jehovah. (Rom. 16:3, 5; Philem. 1, 2) In many lands today, especially where our brothers work under difficulty, meetings are held in the homes of the brothers. Today, too, many Congregation Book Studies are held in the homes of the brothers and this arrangement continues to have Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Through the Congregation Book Study, elders can give more personal attention to each individual’s spiritual growth.—something that may be difficult to do at larger meetings. The study conductor makes a special effort to become well acquainted with all in his group, shepherding them primarily and caring for their spiritual needs. (Prov. 27:23) He endeavors to work with them in the field service and at times to visit them in their home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> A study is generally located in the vicinity of those attending. For this reason it usually becomes a focal point for field service arrangements. here. Likely by now you have read it and so know for yourself that it is an outstanding Bible study aid. With Jehovah’s blessing we trust that it will accomplish a tremendous work in the months ahead.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">OFFERING IT IN THE HOUSE-TO-HOUSE MINISTRY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How might we effectively present the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book in our house-to-house work during January and February? There are some fine suggestions given on page 8 under Presenting the Good News. Additionally, we can keep in mind that the book often places itself. People see it with its intriguing title and they want it. But if they are not sure, a brief look inside at the chapter headings and the beautiful illustrations quickly helps them to make up their mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Why not try to place it at every opportunity? There are those who have previously shown an interest in the Bible and may even have taken literature. Show it to them. Offer it to those you meet in your daily activity, such as tradesmen and neighbors. Keep a copy where it can be seen and offer it as opportunity affords. Do not forget your nonWitness relatives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 7, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This provides you with opportunities to work with different ones in your group and thus benefit from observing their approach at the door. Right after the book study is a good time to make arrangements to work together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">SHOW PERSONAL INTEREST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you find that there is a familylike atmosphere at your book study? When all show a personal interest in other members of the group it contributes to such feelings of closeness. (Gal. 6:10) For example, do you notice when some are not at the meeting and then let them know’ that they were missed? If a family member was missing from a meal it w'ould surely not go unnoticed by others in the household. All would be concerned. Such a spirit in a book study group draws brothers closer together and encourages them .not to miss a “meal.” When you take a personal interest in each one in the group you will be help-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 7, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font12"> 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 2 </span><span class="font12">Song 103</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements and Announcements in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> Briefly review instructions in July 20, 1980, letter regarding use of Medical Alert card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: “Use New Book in Proclaiming Kingdom Truth.” Talk, along with questions and answers. (Invite publishers a week ahead of time to bring </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book with them for this discussion.) As various features of the book are considered, chairman can refer to certain pages as examples. Thus, we all get better acquainted with the book. Chairman should be well prepared and enthusiastic so publishers appreciate value of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book and will want to share in presenting it in the territory. (Ask brothers to bring </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book again next week.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font12">‘“Young People Ask’—A Series With Bible Answers.” Talk and discussion with audience based on January 8, 1983, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> article. Stress the need for parents to use this material in assisting their own children spiritually. It appears in every issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Encourage participation in magazine work on second Saturday of month. May have opportunity to highlight this feature or other articles in the magazines. Announce field service arrangements. Song 10 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JANUARY 9 </span><span class="font12">Song 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements, including field service arrangements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font12">“Presenting the Good News—With the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">Book.” Discuss paragraphs 1 and 2 with audience. Then review new Topic for Conversation. Help the brothers appreciate the main idea we want to leave with the householder, namely: Man </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font12"> live forever. Psalm 37:29 brings out three main points: (1) Life is promised only to the righteous; (2) life will be on earth; (3) life will be everlasting. Isaiah 55:11 establishes that the promise of everlasting life is not just a dream, for God holds true to his word. Encourage publishers to use appropriate questions in developing the Topic for Conversation at the doors: Was man created just to grow old and die? Is it not the natural desire of man to live? Would a loving God create humans with a desire to live forever and then not make it possible for them to fulfill that desire? Man does react to death as something unnatural. Why does man alone have a concept of eternity? Why is only man able to think about the future? Is it not logical that man, who can cultivate abilities and a sense of values, should continue living? Is it not strange that some animals and trees live longer than man? Following the above discussion, review with audience the suggested presentations in paragraphs 3-5. Comment on the value of being familiar with the references quoted in paragraph 3 and using them if the circumstances are appropriate. After considering paragraphs 3-5 present two well-rehearsed demonstrations based on paragraphs 3 and 5. Conclude with paragraph 6, encouraging all to keep in mind these points so as to be effective in using the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book. Keep in mind two important objectives in this assignment, namely, helping the publishers to use the new Topic for Conversation effectively and helping them to present the new book effectively.</span></p>

While we have had only the first part of January in which to place the book in the door-to-door work, a number of publishers may have had encouraging experiences with the book. Also, we have had the book since our “Kingdom Truth” District Convention last summer and some have had experiences placing the book and studying it with relatives, friends and interested persons. It will be upbuilding to heetr these. Arrange for experiences in advance of meeting.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Circuit Assemblies </span><span class="font5">—A Spiritual Stimulus</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What a fine circuit assembly program was presented to us on the theme “Making the Truth Manifest in Our Lives.” (2 Cor. 4:2) It certainly made us aware of the need to take practical steps in making the truth manifest not only by proclaiming it but also by demonstrating it in every aspect of our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The theme for the series of circuit assemblies starting in February is “Be Rich Toward God, Not Covetous.” (Luke 12:15, 21) The program on Saturday will give full consideration to the subject “Working What Is Good Toward All.” (Gal. 6:10) It will strengthen our determination to lay up spiritual treasure and conquer imperfect fleshly desires. The Sunday morning part “Producing Doers of the Word” will assist us in being more effective in our home Bible study work. The • Scriptures encourage us to be not just heardY-s of the Word, whether at congregation meetings or assemblies, but doers—workers in Jehovah’s service.—Jas. 1:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Circuit assemblies are an important part of the worship of our God, Jehovah. Listening carefully to the program that has been prepared by the ‘faithful slave’ class will stimulate us spiritually, enabling us to receive added refreshment. Make sure you attend every session of your next circuit assembly. It will be spiritually rewarding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In a world so divided, is it not a pleasure to observe the peace and unity of our brothers as they assemble at conventions in large numbers? (Ps. 133:1; Eph. 4:3) Last year 1,108,022 unitedly met together at the 104 district conventions in the contiguous United States and 12,202 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism, thus becoming united praisers of Jehovah. Plans are now being made for approximately 100 “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions to be held this summer. These conventions have been arranged by the “faithful and discreet slave” to build even greater unity. For this to be accomplished in our behalf, it is vital that we be present., To assist you in making any necessary arrangements in order to be there, you will find a list of the 1983 “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions on page 6. Additionally, the following information will prove beneficial as you arrange to attend and help others to be there.—Matt. 24: 45-47; Acts 20:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING YOUR CONVENTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Listed on page 6, in date order, is each convention city and the circuits (or portions thereof) assigned to attend each convention. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should attend the convention to which your circuit is assigned. Where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, you should attend on the dates shown for your circuit or portion thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) may have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it is preferred that you attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit, such as V2 or V4, is assigned to a particular location, it simply means that those congregations in the part of the circuit closest to that convention should attend where indicated and the rest of the circuit should attend the convention closest to them as shown elsewhere on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Our attendance at the “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions will be extremely rewarding. We should attend every session as it will help strengthen our unity with Jehovah, his Kingdom and our brothers. —1 Cor. 1:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the hotel or motel by using the information that will be provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay less than the regular rates charged by the hotel or motel since the convention has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms to be set aside for this purpose. These rooms will be assigned by the hotel or motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. By the middle of December 1982, your congregation will have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates and the phone number to be used in making your reservations. PLEASE NOTE: The program again this year will start at 1:40 p.m. on Thursday, thus saving lodging expenses for many.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: As soon as </span><span class="font13">your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization you should IMMEDIATELY phone the hotel or motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">deposit</span><span class="font13"> will be required at all locations to hold the room and should be sent directly to the hotel or motel as soon as your reservations are confirmed, well in advance of the cutoff date listed on the sheet(s) received from the rooming department. Do not make rooming arrangements you do not intend to keep. (Matt. 5:37) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Motels or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date without a deposit.</span><span class="font13"> If you find it necessary for good reason to cancel your accommodations you should write or phone the hotel or motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who need accommodations. The convention rooming department will monitor the arrangement and provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels or motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel or motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font13">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel or motel listing. Those needing accommodatiohs of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font13">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf or other needy ones. Also, they may care for needs in other ways, such as assisting in making arrangements or even aiding financially, if possible and where needed. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3: 17, 18; Acts 20:35) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all needy ones. (2 Cor. 6:11-13; John 13:35; Gal. 6: 10) However, the convention rooming department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who can be cared for neither by themselves nor by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though the convention coordinator forwards it to the convention rooming department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodation by the rooming department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention rooming department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">, <sup>10</sup> Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money, such as for a vacation. They are for the convention period </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only.</span><span class="font13"> It is improper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates extra days so as to visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">H </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font13">District conventions are arranged at many locations to reduce travel. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if a few for important reasons must attend a location other than the one assigned, they may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where they wish to attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless these persons have special needs, they should </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the hotel or motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels or motels they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">12</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED: </span><span class="font13">The smoothness with which this rooming arrangement functions depends largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention rooming department, it could cause a major breakdown in negotiations. Also, it could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose, for one reason or another, to make their own arrangements with facilities not listed that have not cooperated with the convention rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels or motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so as to be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> As shown in the accompanying chart, sign language translation will be provided </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font13"> at 16 specific convention cities. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(No </span><span class="font13">provisions will be made at any other conventions for sign language.) This arrangement worked well last year. We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers can do much to let the deaf in their congregation know of these arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Upon receipt of this insert, the congregation convention coordinator should meet with the presiding overseer before the next Service Meeting to determine from the circuit list which city and dates their congregation is in as of February 1, 1983. (If the coordinator is caring for both positions, he should meet with another member of the congregation service committee.) Where a fraction of a circuit (¥2, ¥4, and so forth) is involved, they should determine which convention their congregation should attend and plan accordingly. Then, please announce at the next Service Meeting as well as the following </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> Study the location and dates assigned by the Society for the congregation. It would be good to underline on the circuit list the assigned convention city and dates for the congregation and post that portion of the insert on the information board.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> The elder serving as the convention coordinator should conduct one of the Service Meeting parts covering this insert as scheduled, as well as handle other convention material and announcements on the meetings. This will help to acquaint the congregation with their convention coordinator. When covering this insert the important paragraphs should be read. All the elders will want to cooperate fully and offer suggestions to ensure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">AN EXCELLENT STUDY BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Why can we be confident that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book is an outstanding Bible study aid that will have a great part in the future ingathering? Because what was learned in using the successful Bible study aids </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</span><span class="font12"> was drawn upon in developing this new book. Thus it contains basically the same Scriptural material along with the fine teaching techniques found in these older books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Much consideration was given as to how the various Bible doctrines could be explained in a clearer, more pointed way. Time was taken to make illustrations, .both visual and verbal, more effective and questions more searching. One constant goal was to reach the student’s heart. One publisher writes: “Even more than its lovely presentation and abundant illustrations, I just love the powerful use of scriptures and questions and the personal approach—to make the student see all things in connection with his relationship to Jehovah. The clear-cut contrasts made should help people see the need to make decisions, yes, changes in their beliefs, conduct, attitudes and religion.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">A WIDER RANGE OF SUBJECT MATERIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> In addition to its improved, effective way of presenting Bible truths, the new book covers a wider range of subject matter than our previous study aids. Information vital for new’ ones has been incorporated to benefit the student. For example, in recent times the matter of moral conduct has been a big stumbling block that hinders many newer ones from progressing in the truth. So this master is given thorough treatment. Not only is direct counsel provided regarding what wrongs to avoid and how to avoid them but also there is encouragement to do what is right.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> In house-to-house ministry, in street witnessing, in making return visits—it is recommended that each publisher be equipped wdth one or more copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book. Do not go in the field without it! Your positive attitude in presenting the book, describing its contents and placing it will prepare the way for starting many new home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">.<sup>10</sup> Let us present the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book enthusiastically during January and February as we take advantage of the privilege Jehovah has given us in these final days to keep proclaiming Kingdom truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">ing to engender this “family” spirit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Can you think of additional ways to show personal interest in others? One thing you can ..do is to make a special effort to engage others in conversation at the meetings, not just greeting them. Some may tend to be shy but are looking for someone to talk with and would respond if approached. There are many other things that can be done. Your book study conductor may have some specific suggestions. Why not ask him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> How can you help when another member of your book study group seems to be discouraged or to have a problem? The counsel to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls” would surely be fitting. (1 Thess. 5: 14) If someone is ill, how comforting it is when friends stop by to visit and offer assistance! Often just knowing someone else noticed, and cares is all that is needed. The book study conductor, much like a parent, should especially be alert to notice signs of discouragement and to offer needed help.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">HOW CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> There are other ways you can contribute to the book study arrangement. Your good example is one w<sup>T</sup>ay. For instance, when you dress as you would to attend a meeting at the Kingdom Hall you show respect. You set a positive example for those who may have developed the habit of dressing casually. Do you make it a practice to be on time so as not to disturb the meeting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> It is clear that the study is more lively when all prepare well, perhaps underlining the answers and then commenting in their own words. Looking up cited scriptures in advance and then commenting on them can add muqh to the meeting. Some also find time to look up supporting material on important points and then they share this with the group. This is appreciated. All these things contribute toward making the Congregation Book Study spiritually refreshing and upbuilding to all in attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Those who regularly- attend the book study are convinced that it- has Jehovah’s blessing. It is a place where one can get personal assistance and contribute to the spiritual refreshment of others. If you are not attending this meeting regularly, why not make the necessary adjustments in your schedule so that you can enjoy this excellent meeting that Jehovah and his organization have prepared for you.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Eternal life in perfection in a beautiful earthly paradise! What a sublime gift from Jehovah! His love should impel us to share this hope with people in our territory, using the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In order to be well equipped to discuss the subject of living forever in paradise on earth and to present this new book, all of us should first have read it ourselves. No doubt you have some interesting field service points that can be used with the new Topic for Conversation. Knowing the kind of people living in our territory will aid us in determining which chapters or specific points may be used to arouse their interest in Jehovah’s promise of everlasting life. Note illustrations that will capture the householder’s interest in the truth. Have these in mind when presenting the new book in your territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">SUGGESTED PRESENTATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The illustrations in chapter 19 are excellent for field service. After reading Psalm 37:29, you could say: “What do you think conditions on earth will be like when the righteous live here forever?<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">1</a></sup>[Allow householder an opportunity to reply.] Please note these illustrations and comments starting on page 156 of this new book.” Then, depending on the time available, point out some of the features of God’s New Order as illustrated on pages 156-158, 161 and 162. Help the householder to appreciate the Scriptural support for the statements made. Then you may conclude with Isaiah 55:11, showing that we can fully rely on these promises. Offer the book on a contribution of $2.50.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Chapter 1 harmonizes nicely with the new Topic for Conversation. After greeting the householder, you might say: “My purpose in calling is</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">January 30: Pages 161 to 168 to share with you God’s promise to make this earth a paradise and give man unending life. Many people feel that the possibility of living forever on earth is just a dream. What do you think? [Allow for a response.] Scientists claim that man is made in such a way that he ought to live forever. These men say that the body’s ability to replace cells and thus renew itself should really continue indefinitely. [For more information see </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth </span><span class="font12">book, page 28, paragraph 3; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font12">April 22, 1977, pages 3-5.] The Bible agrees with that and speaks clearly and confidently about man living forever in a paradise earth. Notice what is stated here at Psalm 37:29. [If time permits, you may also read and comment on texts such as Isaiah 45:18; John 3:14-16, 36; Revelation 21:3, 4.] Some may be skeptical about this promise. However, since Jehovah God cannot lie, we have every reason to believe it. His words in Isaiah 55:11 assure it. [Read.] Is that not a wonderful prospect? [Allow for a comment.] I will be pleased to leave with you this new publication entitled </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font12"> Chapter 1 discusses further why living forever is not just a dream. The book is yours for a contribution of $2.50.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you are working in a territory where many do not believe in God, you could say: “My reason for visiting you today is to share information about the future. Have you ever wondered if it is possible for man to live forever? [Allow for comment.] Some are not inclined to believe this as they feel that God does not exist. So, living forever is considered just a dream. This book makes an interesting point that builds confidence in God’s existence and in the basis for believing his promises. [Point to page 35 and read paragraph 3.] Thus, when he created the earth and man, he had a purpose. [Read Psalm 37:29.] He has assured us that his purpose has not changed. [Read Isaiah 55:11.] It will be a pleasure to leave this new book with you on a contribution of $2.50.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In view of what Jehovah has done in our behalf, we have much for which to be thankful. Show appreciation for his loving-kindness by aiding others with the help of the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book.

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Question SBox</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font12">When should an assistant be asked to conduct the Congregation Book Study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The <sub>t</sub> assistant would conduct in the absence of the appointed conductor. It would not be appropriate for him to conduct the book study periodically as training. The assigned conductor is responsible for teaching the group and, when present, he should do so unless there are extenuating circumstances. (Rom. 12:7) In most cases elders are assigned as study conductors since teaching is a weighty responsibility. (Jas. 3:1) It is not a matter of simply reading the questions and calling on persons for comments. The insight and experience of spiritually older men can be very beneficial to those in the group, helping them to understand, to explain and to apply in their lives the truths being studied. Of course, well-qualified ministerial servants may be assigned this responsibility if qualified elders are not available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An assistant can learn effective methods of teaching by observing closely the assigned book study conductor. He can acquire teaching ability through diligence in preparing and delivering Theocratic Ministry School talks, parts on the Service Meeting and by conducting home Bible studies with individuals and families. Thus, he will be in a good position to benefit his brothers when he is called on to substitute for the assigned conductor. Also, assistants can be very helpful in organizing and leading the group in field service when the assigned conductor is unable to do so.</span></p>

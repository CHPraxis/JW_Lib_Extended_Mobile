<p><span class="font0">John 17:3—Everlasting life is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">John 17:17—We can believe the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Why has the Bible exercised such a powerful influence on the lives of millions of people for centuries? One reason is that it contains direction from man’s Creator. (Ps. 19:7-11; 119:105) Bible writers themselves testify that the Scriptures did not come by their own efforts but by inspiration from God. (2 Sam: 23:2) They wrote as they were directed by holy spirit. —2 Pet. 1:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When we study and apply the words written under the direction of holy spirit, we find they exert power in our lives. This can be seen by the way many persons have been moved to make great changes in their lives so that they come into harmony with God’s Word. Thousands have been influenced by God’s Word to dedicate their lives to Jehovah and do his will.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POWER IN OUR LIVES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Does the Word of God exert power in your life? We should be “intensely occupied with the word” and anxious to help others learn more about it. (Acts 18:5) Paul wrote: “When you received God’s word,... you accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truth</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">Punctuality—A Mark ©1? Thoughtfulness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Better late than never!” or “I may come late to the meetings, but I am there!” Have you heard someone make such expressions? But what has the individual missed by coming late to the meetings? Perhaps he missed the joyful singing, which is an essential part of our worship. Or, he missed the priv<sub>7 </sub>ilege of uniting with the congregation in prayer. Latecomers are not there to benefit from an interchange of encouragement before the meetings. Also, when we arrive late, we may distract others and prevent them from receiving the full benefit of the program.—Eccl. 3:1; Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Punctuality is a mark of loving consideration and thoughtfulness. 14 requires good planning and foresight. It is true that there may be times when one is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting. Public transportation may be delayed, or the car may break down. We must make sure, however, that a lack of good planning, indifference or simply not leaving home on time does not result in our being habitual latecomers. We ought to make a genuine effort to be present before the meetings begin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some persons may be tardy because they have not seen the importance of training themselves to fully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in you believers.” (1 Thess. 2:13) It takes a careful study of God’s Word to gain this conviction. God’s Word certainly was at,work in Paul’s life, as it motivated him to undertake his strenuous missionary tours, preaching the good news about the Christ. —Rom. 15:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> For God’s Word to exert power in our life we have to know what it teaches and apply it. (Heb. 4:12) Some choose to ignore the direction it gives. (Elph. 4:25-32) But those who follow the direction of the Scriptures enjoy a fine relationship with their Creator.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPING OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Have you met people who question whether the Bible really is God’s Word? Some say it may be “inspired” in the sense of being from the pen of gifted writers, but they doubt that it is actually from God. Such persons, as well as others, owe it to themselves to examine the Bible, put it to the test and see that it actually is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the truth. </span><span class="font12">(John 17:17) For this reason our offer of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Transla-(Continued on page If, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">be punctual. One who is habitually late, without good reason, may lose the respect of others. How so? In the minds of many he may be viewed as being thoughtless or unreliable and thus considered undependable in regard to other matters as well. On the other’hand, being punctual is a way of displaying the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit.—Gal. 5:22, 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How encouraging it is to come to the meetings and find the elders and ministerial servants there, waiting to greet us, giving us a warm feeling of deep appreciation for the fine theocratic family of which we are a part.—Rom. 15:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Arriving on time is also important when meeting for field service. Punctuality results in more time being spent in the all-important preaching and disciplemaking work. But if circumstances make you late for the meeting for field service and you want to work with the group, you may be able to meet the publishers in the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Our punctuality will build Ye-spect for us and for the organization we represent. Yes, punctuality reflects thoughtfulness. It demonstrates orderliness. (1 Cor. 14:40) For example, when invited for din-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">ner, your being punctual shows consideration for your host and the other guests. Is it not true that being on time for spiritual meals with the congregation is even more important? We should always show respect for our Host, Jehovah God, and for his other guests, as well as for the provision of spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Parents can set a good example for their children by being punctual. All of us, including our children, should recommend ourselves and the organization we represent by demonstrating punctuality.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Our Teaching Ability —By the Use of Questions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “When he saw the crowds he went up into the mountain; and after he sat down his disciples came to him; and he opened his mouth and began teaching them.” (Matt. 5:1, 2) Jesus, as the Master Teacher, instructed with skill. Through his effective use of questions, he stimulated the thinking ability of his listeners. He sounded down the truth into their minds and hearts. As Jesus’ disciples, we want to copy his methods in our teaching activity.—Matt. 17: 5-7, 24-26; 18:12; Mark 11:29, 30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE VALUE OF QUESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Much of our success in helping the student depends on the effective use of questions. When used properly, they become outstanding tools for teaching. They cap guide the student’s mind from one point to another in an orderly way, so that he reaches proper conclusions. Questions help in at least three basic ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> First, they help the student express thoughts in his own words. In that way the teacher can ascertain if the student really understands the points being made. Note that in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font12"> book not only are questions found at the bottom of the page and within many paragraphs, but additionally there are questions in a “Review Discussion” box at the end of each chapter, drawing together the overall main points. These questions test the understanding of the student and help him to see how he can make practical application of the information he is learning. Also, questions and suggestions combined with an illustration are used throughout the book as teaching vehicles. Examples of these are found on pages 27, 34 and 101.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Second, questions can help the student to see the reasons for points made. They help him develop reason^ ing ability. He learns to put things in proper perspective, comparing his former beliefs with the truths he is now learning from God’s Word. See questions on paragraphs 13-19 on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Refinements &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> With these refinements, the appropriate method of giving counsel becomes more clearly defined for the benefit of the school overseer as well as for the students. As was pointed out in the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1983, the school overseer need not follow the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip, but rather he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. His objective in giving counsel is to help the student progress in the ministry. Instructions pages 61-63 and paragraphs 13-17 on pages 95 and 96 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Third, you can use viewpoint questions to determine how the student feels personally about a point of truth. For example, during the Bible study you may have occasion to ask one or more of the following questions: Does this sound reasonable? How do you personally feel about what you are learning? Do you think it is important to apply these things in your life? By carefully listening to his answers, you can determine the best way to assist him to love Jehovah with his “whole heart.”—Matt. 22:37.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">KINDS OF QUESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Questions basically ask for facts —Who? What? When? Where? Or, they may ask for conclusions or opinions—How? Why? Viewpoint questions are illustrated in the preceding paragraph. There are also multiplechoice, true-or-false, review and leading questions, to name a few others. Short, concise questions usually are the most effective because they involve only one main idea.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Our objective in asking questions is to help the student gain knowledge and grow in understanding. His answers help us evaluate his progress and heart attitude. (Eph. 3: 17-19) Also, well-worded questions can help lead the student’s mind to Bible answers that will educate his conscience. (Compare Paul’s method at Galatians 3:1-6, also his 17 questions in 1 Corinthians 9:1-14.) Questions skillfully used in teaching will move the student to put to work in his life the truths he is learning. —Isa. 25:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Rewards for being a good teacher are great. When we teach we share something valuable with another person. We give of ourselves to help someone else. Will you make the effort it takes to be a good teacher? Teaching others is an enriching experience that can add joy to life and bring a sense of wholesome accomplishment.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">in the new School Schedule offer further clarifications on how this can be done, under the heading “Counsel and Remarks.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you have not done so already, take time now and carefully study this portion of the Instructions so that you will be able to take full advantage of the training available to you in the Theocratic Ministry School during 1984. You can be sure that Jehovah will richly bless whatever effort you are able to exert toward improving your ministry through this congregational arrangement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark13"></a>To Relatives</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom message is refreshing good news to our ears, but others, whose hearts are not inclined toward Jehovah, are not moved by it. (Matt. 13:15) When approached with the good news, they show little interest. Most of us have unbelieving relatives like this. Yet our family relationship may offer an opportunity to witness that may not be available otherwise. (Compare John 1:40, 41.) Many now in the truth got started through help from a relative. Have you tried to take advantage of this unique opportunity to witness? You may be the only one who can get your relatives to listen.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNITIES TO WITNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Relatives not in the truth may come for a brief visit or to stay for a few days during vacation time. This may provide opportunities to give a tactful witness. Appropriate items of literature might be left in convenient places in your home. The prayers you offer at mealtimes may give you a chance to talk about your relationship with Jehovah. Invite your relatives to the meetings. Your faithfulness in attending meetings during this time may give you an opportunity to tell what goes on and why you feel it is important for you to attend. Their sitting in and listening during your family study could result in a real blessing to them. If you should be visiting in their home, you may find other ways to give an effective witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Children are often the center of attention when families get together. Having that in mind, parents might review some basic aspects of the Kingdom message with the children beforehand. Some casual state</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Word &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">tion of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> along with any one of the older 192-page books will provide them with what they need to make this examination. The contribution of’$3.75 is nominal,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> It is not just the placement of literature that is important. The question is,. Can more persons be helped so that God’s Word will exert beneficial power and influence in their lives, and on their families as it has for us? Our Topic for Conversation, “What Hope for a Happy Future?” is appropriate, as the Bible is the only book that gives a sure hope and accurately foretells the future. John 17:3 shows that our hope includes everlasting life, and at John 17:17 Jesus testifies that God’s Word is truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Use questions to involve the ment or incident might prompt the children to speak up in an appealing way that touches the heart of other family members. At times such expressions have a more telling effect than much witnessing by older ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Occasionally relatives are brought together under sad circumstances, such as when someone is seriously ill or there has been a death in the family. Comforting thoughts based on God’s Word may give cause for hope and touch a heart that has been unresponsive in the past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Opportunities may present themselves under other unfavorable circumstances. The relatives may insist on an explanation because you decline to participate with the family in observing some holiday or family custom. Let them know in a tactful manner what you believe and wjiy. (1 Pet. 3:15) Your sincere response without criticizing their beliefs could make a lasting impression.—Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSING BY YOUR CONDUCT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Even if your relatives are strongly opposed, you are still able to give a witness by your conduct. ('1 Pet. 2:12) Always conducting yourself in a thoughtful, respectful manner may favorably impress others. This is especially important when they say things to provoke you or test your determination to be guided by Bible principles.—1 Cor. 10:31-33; 2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> There is cause for special joy when a family member accepts the truth. Perhaps nothing could bring us more satisfaction than to see a loved one find the way to life. That prospect should be enough to motivate us to seek opportunities to witness to our relatives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">householder and help him see that a happy future is possible. For example, you could ask, “Did you know that at John 17:3 Jesus talks about living forever?” Or in commenting on John 17:17, we might say: “Did you know that the person who taught and influenced more people than any other man who ever lived pointed to God’s Word as the source of truth? That Teacher was Jesus, and he said: [Read.].”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> During the month of December we will also have opportunity to offer the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font12"> for a contribution of 25c. This will be of special interest to persons who may have reading difficulties. Also, many families will enjoy having this brochure to discuss with their children. It can help them learn more about the Kingdom and how Jehovah will car</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Brochure to Be Featured) m Congregation Book Study</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As announced in the October issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font12">Congregation Book Studies for the weeks of January 1 through February 5, 1984, will be conducted in the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century</span><span class="font12"> (1979 revised edition). The material in this publication is especially designed to inform inquiring people about Jehovah’s Witnesses—their background, work, beliefs and goals. A careful study of this brochure will help equip us to use it effectively in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It will be necessary for the study conductors to prepare appropriate questions, since none are provided. Simple questions designed to emphasize the Scriptural basis for our work would be best. Time should be allowed to look up and make application of some of the cited scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The study for the week of February 5 has been set aside for considering page 13, dealing with “What Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe.” Forty-two fundamental beliefs are listed along with supporting Scripture texts. In covering this material, we recommend that the conductor state each belief; then comments should be made on the cited Scriptural references, pointing out how they support the belief. Key Scripture texts can be read as time permits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The study of this brochure should heighten our own appreciation for Jehovah’s modern-day organization. Endeavor to be present at the Congregation Book Study each week and become equipped to use this information to good advantage in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">ry out his will to make the earth a Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Interested persons need to« study the Bible and become convinced that it is really the Word of God. Keeping that in mind, we should try to start Bible discussions. If the person is not convinced that the Bible is inspired, you could talk about this when you make a return visit.—See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font12"> under “Bible, inspiration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Only by learning the truth and being convinced that the Bible is inspired of God will sincere persons be motivated to follow its direction, which leads to everlasting life; (Prov. 2:1, 20, 21) If we do our part, we will see the influence of the Word of God grow’ in our territory as new’ ones become obedient to the faith.—Acts 6:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Are These the Last Days? Luke 21:10, 11—What Jesus said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 21:28—We can survive.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bearing Witness to the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is “the God of truth.” (Ps. 31:5) His Word and his law are truth. The psalmist prayed: “Make me walk in your truth and teach me, for you are my God of salvation.” (Ps. 25:5) What a change it would make in this world if everyone spoke the truth and walked in it! There would be no reason for mistrust of one’s mate or suspicion that business matters were being misrepresented. Courts would no longer have the tremendous task of trying to determine who is speaking the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Especially vital to all of us is knowing the truth found in God’s Word, as it holds out the promise of everlasting life. (1 John 5:13) Yet the Roman ruler Pilate seemed so perplexed after listening to Jesus’ testimony concerning His Kingdom and the truth that he asked, “What is truth?” (John 18:36-38) Despite the fact that he found nc fault with Jesus, he was willing to bow to the pressures of religious opposers of the truth. We certainly do not want to follow his course.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BRINGING TRUTH TO OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Many persons today, like Pilate, do not recognize the testimony of truth when it is presented to them. Others oppose it. But Jesus said</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Sacrifices to Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What do we have to offer our Grand Creator? In the days of Israel various sacrifices, or offerings, were presented to Jehovah. There was the communion offering denoting peace with Jehovah. The thanksgiving offering expressed appreciation for God’s provisions and loving-kindnesses. Sin offerings were presented for forgiveness of many kinds of sin, while guilt offerings were for special sins by which a person had contracted guilt. The offerings could include a number of things, depending on the reason for the sacrifice and one’s personal circumstances. It could be a valuable bull, sheep or goat, or perhaps a turtledove or pigeon. Grain offerings of fine flour or cakes might be offered or perhaps a drink offering. All served to emphasize the need for a favorable relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We have this same need today, but since we are no longer under the Law covenant given to the Jews, our sacrifices are of necessity different. As Christians, we are to offer “a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to [God’s] name.” (Heb. 13:15) We are encouraged “to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptthat some persons, sheeplike ones, would hear his voice as his message is carried to them by persons of faith. To bring.this spiritual freedom and truth to such persons, we need to handle the Word of truth aright.—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦ To do this, do you take time to prepare for service? Do you work with others in the field to improve your ability and effectiveness? What can you do to make your presentation more interesting? One thing is to review the Topic for Conversation beforehand or when meeting for service. Then you will know just what to say when you go out. You should have an enthusiastic introduction. Will the presentation appeal to others? Help your family with such preparations also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OBTAINING SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Since </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is a primary channel for dispensing the truth to others, we need to be well acquainted with each magazine we present. This means reading it through first and then looking for points we would like to use in the field. In each issue we can find points that tie in with our Topic for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2} </span><span class="font11">able to God through Jesus Christ. (1 Pet. 2:5) What about our sacrifices of praise? Are they acceptable to Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> There are certain things acceptable to Jehovah that all of us can offer. As in the days of Israel, we may have certain material things that can be used to advance the Kingdom interests. (Mark 12: 41-44) But whether we have little or much in a material way, we do have time and a certain amount of energy. Also, of importance for all of us is our knowledge and appreciation of the truth. Does our heart motivate us to share this good news with our neighbors? Whether we started in Kingdom service many years ago or just recently, our efforts can be well pleasing to Jehovah. (Matt. 20:1-16) He knows what we can do and is pleased to see us share the good news with others according to our circumstances.—John 15:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ENLARGING OUR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* The way to move ahead in the service is to take advantage of the opportunities you have. Are you regularly conducting a study with your family? This will help your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font11"> i)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 109</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Welcome and local announcements. Outline field service arrangements for the week. (1 Tim. 2:7) Mention importance of turning in field reports promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Review of “Bearing Witness to the Truth.” A talk on opening three paragraphs can serve as an introduction to the part, with the balance being covered by questions and answers. In conclusion, report number of subscriptions obtained during April and, as time permits, briefly interview some who obtained subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Our United Efforts in Accomplishing Our Ministry. Handled by elder as outlined in Society’s letter of February 1, 1983. Song 16 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 81</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7 min: Local announcements, including congregation field report for April, national report for February and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: Question-and-answer coverage of “Presenting the Good News—By Developing Magazine Routes.” Include brief interviews with any in the congregation who have magazine routes. For paragraph 7, have two publishers who do well in the magazine work discuss briefly the article in each current magazine that they plan to highlight. Then demonstrate presentation in paragraph as a return visit on a person who took the magazines. Encourage support for second Saturday magazine activity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font11">Handling the Word of Truth Aright. After book study elder discusses with publishers need for personal research and study in order to be able to handle ‘the Word of truth aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) He has heard that the brothers at the Society’s office are getting an increasing number of phone calls and letters asking Bible questions, when oftentimes a little research in the indexes would provide the answers to these questions. Imagine the problem if each of the Approximately 600,000 publishers in the United States would write in, asking just one question a year! Good to do personal research or ask help of husband, study conductor or another elder, if necessary. Sister mentions she has trouble finding answers to questions. Group mentions </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font11"> book as good source or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font11"> if specific scripture is involved. Another asks about smoking; not mentioned in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font11"> book or referred to in Scripture, as it was not a practice in Bible days. Brother explains principles to be found in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font11"> under that topic. Mentions 1976-1980 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font11"> reference, under subhead “addiction,” to January 8, 1978, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> pages 27-8; briefly discusses key scriptures. Group agrees it is satisfying to do own research and do want to save brothers at the Society unnecessary questions if they can find the answer themselves. Encourage use of congregation library if publications not available at home. Conclude with audience review of Question Box. Song 63 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MAY 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 116</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">15 min: Consideration of “Our Sacrifices to Jehovah.” May wish to cover first three paragraphs as introductory talk and then handle remainder with audience discussion. 25 min: Discussion of “1983 ‘Kingdom Unity’ District Convention” insert from beginning to section on “Fine Conduct” on page 4, column 2. Read key paragraphs if time permits. Stress importance of making arrangements now to attend so as to enjoy spiritual benefits.

Telling why </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font11"> find the magazine interesting and of value may help the person to decide that he would also benefit from receiving this fine spiritual material. Is the person religiously inclined? Does he believe the Bible or perhaps attend church? Then he should find the material in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> enlightening, faith-strengthening and revealing. On the other hand, many people believe in God but are not associated with any religious group. They may have been disappointed by what they saw in organized religion. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> will appeal also to them.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Song 85</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Local announcements. Encourage magazine distribution fourth Saturday in month. Highlight one article in each of current magazines that would make good talking point for magazine distribution. Encourage all, including interested persons and Bible students, to attend Congregation Book Study regularly and enjoy study of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book. Especially encourage families to help children prepare to share in book study.—Deut. 6:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font11">Audience discussion of balance of convention insert from “Fine Conduct” to conclusion, including “District Convention Reminders.” If any in congregation foresee problems in getting to entire convention, encourage them to talk with others to see if arrangements might be made so that no one will miss any of this fine spiritual provisioa from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 min: “Auxiliary Pioneering —A Stepping-Stone.” Questions and answers. When considering paragraph 2, ask audience to comment on how auxiliary pioneering has personally benefited them in their field ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">a divisive force but that following the teachings of the Bible unites people of all races. Additionally, it holds out the hope of a united world by means of God’s heavenly Kingdom. It does not present a false hope of converting the world. Neither does it advocate a “kingdom” of faith found only in the heart of believers and without impact on others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Yes, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> covers a wide range of Scriptural topics. It has helped many of its readers to make over their personalities. It is our hope that by offering the yearly subscription of 24 issues for $3.50 ($2.00 for monthly issues), we may help many more to know and accept the truth of God’s Word. As we appeal to Jehovah to send out the light and truth to others, let us take every opportunity to bear witness to the truth by offering this fine source of truth and encouragement to them.—Ps. 43:3.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1983 “KINGDOM UNITY” DISTRICT CONVENTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Portions of the Program to Be Heard From Key Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How appropriate that the theme of the district convention this year is “Kingdom Unity.” In Micah 2:12, God declared: “In unity I shall set them, like a flock in the pen.” Unquestionably, Jehovah is directing and unifying his people through the Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Time and again observers have noted the Christian unity of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It stands out in sharp contrast to Satan’s disunited, dying system. For example, the Brazilian newspaper </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">O Tempo </span><span class="font12">reported: “Although there are many imposing religions . . . there does not exist a single one on the face of the earth today that shows the same love and unity as the theocratic organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” And our yeartext reminds us that love is ‘our perfect bond of .union,’ a union that embraces the entire association of our brothers throughout the world. (Col. 3:14; 1 Pet. 2:17) At this year’s conventions love will add strength to our unity, making it stand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AN ADDED FEATURE: </span><span class="font12">An added feature to enhance the convention theme is the arrangement for all conventions to be tied in by telephone wire to a key city at certain times. Each week at conventions in the United States and Canada all assembled will be united as one throng in listening to portions of the program originating in a key city. In each of the six successive weeks that conventions are scheduled, there will be days when Jehovah’s people will have opportunity to hear certain talks by members of the Governing Body who will speak from a key city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No matter which convention your circuit has been assigned to attend, you will be able to benefit from some program parts presented by these brothers from the Brooklyn headquarters. When you attend your convention, you will learn which is the key city for that week when the program comes through. There is no need to write the Society about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As you know, provision is being made for missionaries to visit their home country and to attend a district convention with their families and friends. A special part on the program will deal with their activities. Even though there may not be any missionaries personally present at the convention you attend, there will still be opportunity to hear something on the program regarding the fine work missionaries are doing. In many places, however, missionaries will be invited to share their experiences. This will add further interest to the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> for January 1983 provided a complete list of convention dates and locations. The procedure for obtaining rooming accommodations was also outlined. Will you be there? Again, this year we eagerly anticipate gathering together to worship Jehovah at our “Kingdom Unity” District Convention. As King David stated in Psalm 133:1, it is “good” and “pleasant” that we do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTEND ALL FOUR DAYS: </span><span class="font12">Psalm 119:33 expresses the fervent prayer: &quot;Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last.” Surely, these words reflect the sentiments of all of Jehovah’s dedicated servants. “The faithful and discreet slave” has scheduled four days in which Jehovah’s “regulations” will be discussed and demonstrated. Will you be seated and attentive during all the sessions from the opening song and prayer on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. to the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon? No one would want to miss any of the convention program. It would be incorrect to conclude that any day or even a part of a day would be less important than the rest. The ent tire four days should be regarded as a complete theocratic meal, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> of which is needed for our spiritual health and growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many will have to make adjustments in their weekly schedule in order to be present for the entire convention. This may mean requesting time off from your secular employment or taking vacation time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For many, some effort and sacrifices will be required to attend a district convention. One brother who traveled to the convention last summer with his family wrote: “We drove 400 miles to our convention, spent a considerable amount of money and made many sacrifices, yet we felt the blessings we received were 100 times greater than anything it took to be there.” Every effort should be made so that none in the family will miss any of the program. Understandably, there may be extenuating circumstances preventing a few from attending all four days, but in such cases, it would be a loving gesture if some would share the high points with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We again urge you, please attend the convention to which you are assigned when this is possible. Some convention sites may appeal<sup>1</sup> more desirable because of being located in a scenic area or because the facilities themselves may appear to be better. But considerable work and planning are put forth by the Society and the brothers locally to see that there are adequate seating, literature and food for everyone. In some instances in the past, hardships were created when more people than expected attended a convention outside their assigned area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INTENT LISTENING BRINGS BLESSINGS: </span><span class="font12">In Isaiah 55:2 Jehovah commanded Israel: “Listen intently to me.” The word “intent” is defined as “directed with strained or eager attention.” Israel had good reason to listen intently because Jehovah was directing a message of liberation that was like nourishing food and refreshing drink. The message Jehovah has for his people today</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1983</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">is of no less value. In reality it is even more precious because it is a message dealing with life everlasting. Who does not want to have understanding of Jehovah’s purposes for mankind? If we are attentive during the convention we will eagerly “listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) To listen and to learn at a district convention usually takes more effort and concentration than it does at the Kingdom Hall. You are sitting for longer periods of time and there are more distractions. What can be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We need to remember our purpose in attending the convention. Because it involves a sacrifice of time and finances to be present, would it not be sensible to benefit fully from this expenditure? No question about it! To this end, would it not be advisable to arrive early, take care of any matters that need attention, such as obtaining convention tickets and literature, and then be seated when the program begins? This will leave you relaxed, with your mind uncluttered with concern over matters not related to the program. There is also no substitute for an adequate night’s rest. Convention time affords a good opportunity to renew friendships, but if we choose to do this by visiting late into the night, would we be alert enough the next day to “listen intently”? We may struggle just to keep awake. A good night’s sleep will make concentration easier. As you listen, weigh the information being presented. In your mind, compare it with what you already know. Taking </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font12"> notes will also help because if you try to write down too much, you may miss important points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Parents with small children face an additional challenge to good concentration. It is usually more difficult for the little ones to sit for several hours. They are naturally more restless. The result is that their parents and, at times, others around them are distracted. And yet, it has been observed that some children, even of preschool age, will sit quietly through most of the program. What is the secret? Unquestionably, it is proper training at home and in the Kingdom Hall. Parents who have deep respect for the spiritual food coming from the platform will make every effort to instill this same respect and appreciation in their youngsters. Children can be trained to sit still at home and also through congregation meetings without needlessly going to the restroom. This good training will produce dividends at the convention in that both parents and children will benefit from the program. The naturally shorter attention span of children can be improved if parents suggest that their children take notes of Scripture citations on a writing pad rather than allowing them to draw pictures. Of course, there will be times when parents have to leave their seats to take a child to the restroom or even to administer discipline. Please do this as quietly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIAN MANNERS, A MARK OF LOVE: </span><span class="font12">The good conduct and manners of Jehovah’s Witnesses have often been commented on by others arid this has been especially true with regard to our large conventions. One manager of a civic center stated: “This letter is to tell you how pleasant it was having the Jehovah’s Witness convention here ... I had been told in advance how'organized and how clean the group would be and they certainly lived up to all their advance publicity. I do not believe I have worked with a group of people more willing to cooperate on all matters, whether small or large.” Our good reputation for fine Christian manners even compelled one principal of a school, where quite a few young Witnesses are students, to send a bulletin to his staff of teachers suggesting that, if necessary, they reschedule their final exams for the Witness children who were planning to attend one of the earlier conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, it is evident from reports received from different parts of the country that there is still room for improvement. The problem of seat saving persists. The brother quoted earlier who drove 400 miles to the convention and made many sacrifices also stated: “Yet, I was deeply troubled by the problem of seat saving.” Another brother writing about the same matter mentioned that this has always been a problem, but “this year, I believe, was probably the worst!” Some brothers reported that they arrived early for the convention with their families, only to find that most of the seats were already saved. Ip many cases one person would arrive when the building opened and save entire rows of seats for his family and friends who would sleep late. Another brother who observed someone saving seats mentioned that the only reason more seats were not saved was because the person ran out of items to place on the chairs. Remember the newspaper writer from Brazil who praised the “love and unity” of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Love has been defined as a perfect expression of unselfishness. Christ Jesus also revealed that unselfish love would be a primary means of identifying his disciples. (John 13:35) Is the saving of large numbers of seats a good example of this godlike love in action? And when you think about it, when a person attends a sports event his admission fee entitles him to occupy just one seat. Since the Society organizes and pays for the convention facilities, do we even have the right to save seats that we will not occupy ourselves? Some of the saved seats were never occupied, and when the attendants attempted to fill them they met with some resistance. We are asking that you please cooperate with the attendants who have been assigned by the convention organization to try to find seats for everyone as well as to maintain an atmosphere conducive to learning. Would we not thus be following the golden rule?—Matt. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FINE CONDUCT: </span><span class="font12">First Peter 2:12 counsels: “Maintain your conduct </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">fine</span><span class="font12"> among the nations.” In the past it has been necessary to bring to our attention that there was room for improvement in our conduct at hotels, motels and restaurants. We are happy to say that favorable reports have been received in this connection. In fact, a newspaper in one convention city reported: “Women wearing dresses and looking like women. Men with neat looking haircuts, wearing suits and ties and looking respectable. Husbands arm and arm with their own wives. Parents and children together as families. Children obeying their parents, and not being disrespectful or destructive. People carrying Bibles, instead of knives or switchblades. No stealing or shop-lifting.” Indeed, this was a fine report, and we found it encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nevertheless, some information has come to our attention from brothers involved in convention organization that there is still need for us to work on our conduct at conventions. Children have not always been kept under control while staying in motels, and some have shown a lack of respect for private property. This has also been true regarding the convention facilities themselves. One report from the convention organization stated: “It makes it very difficult for us to build a good name as Jehovah’s Witnesses when our children are making it difficult for the motels in the convention city.” One motel had to close its pool because it was no longer suitable for use after some Witness children had been in it most of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Likewise, we continually need to be conscious of our attire during the convention. It has been observed that some have been dressed quite casually, as though on a picnic or outing. The same casual clothing is worn by some even while visiting the Society’s branch offices. Surely we should dress appropriately fot the occasion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The wise man said: “For everything there is an appointed time, ... a time to keep quiet and a time to speak.” (Eccl. 3:1, 7) During the program is the time to be quiet. Some conventions reported excessive noise and talking during the sessions. This has occurred in the corridors as well as in the auditorium. Some were talking loudly to those near them, disturbing others in the area who were trying to listen to the program. Both youngsters and adults have been involved. Along with the conversation, there was, at times, the passing of food and drink to friends and family sitting nearby. Sometimes the conversation and the movements in the corridors became so loud that those seated near the back or the exits had difficulty hearing the program. One brother wrote: “We were not able to hear much because people were talking and walking around. There was a brother in the back row talking all through the assembly.” Another: “It seems that many did not take to heart the counsel given in the chairman’s talk about needless walking and talking in the hallway.” Attendants had limited success in their efforts to curtail unnecessary activity in the hallways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Wrote the apostle Paul: “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.” (1 Cor. 10:24) There will be times when children become restless, and babies will cry when they are uncomfortable. In harmony with the Biblical principle, would you not be seeking the other person’s advantage by not permitting the child to disturb those around you? This may require leaving your seat temporarily, but, unquestionably, others who are trying to hear will be grateful for your thoughtfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS: We are </span><span class="font12">pleased to inform you that there will be special field service arrangements on Thursday afternoon, immediately following the session. Even before leaving for the convention, why not make definite plans to participate in the ministry? Besides the fine witness that will be given in the convention city, devoting some time to the field service will heighten your enthusiasm for the entire program. It would be to your advantage if you would </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">pick up territory as soon as you arrive </span><span class="font12">rather than waiting until the Thursday afternoon session has concluded. Car groups should also be organized so that no time will be lost. Publishers should bring their own magazines for use in the field as there will be only a limited supply at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font12">At times, managers of buildings we use for our conventions and other observers have commented on how hard everyone works to make the convention run smoothly. The manager of the civic center referred to earlier was pleased to “work with a group of people . &lt;&nbsp;. willing to cooperate on all matters.” We are again inviting those who would be able to spend at least some time during the convention in volunteer service to do so. There is a greater feeling of satisfaction that comes to anyone who has contributed some of his time and talents to making the convention a success. Whatever work you are privileged to do, such as in keeping the convention facilities clean, you would want to do so eagerly, reflecting the good example that Jesus set at John 13:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Have you considered volunteering as a family? This has proved to be an excellent idea. The entire family is able to work together and even those under 16 years of age can have a share, which would not be possible if they were by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As in the past, convention departments will be requesting brothers locally to volunteer ahead of time. Usually this does not fill all the convention needs for volunteers. The larger departments, such as food service and cleaning, are often in need of additional help. This is where others with a willing spirit can have a small share in making the convention a success. Your congregation’s convention coordinator will be notified in time as to which departments need additional help, and he will share this with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font12">One feature of a district convention that we always appreciate is the availability of food and drink, usually served in the same building where the program originates. This not only makes it convenient but also saves us the time it would take to travel to a restaurant. We are also afforded the opportunity of enjoying fellowship with our brothers between the sessions. Do we not appreciate the hard work of the brothers in the Food Service Department, providing us with adequate meals at a reasonable cost?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Convention tickets to purchase food and drink come in sheets worth $1 each. Tickets will be available in advance at your congregation. We suggest that you estimate your needs ahead of time and purchase the tickets you will need for the first two or three days. Surplus food sales will also be held at the conclusion of the convention. You may use your tickets to purchase any of the surplus items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truly we are the most blessed people on the earth today. Soon we will have the joy of gathering again with thousands of our brothers and sisters at the “Kingdom Unity” District Convention. The words of David at Psalm 122:1 express our feelings when he said: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’ ” May we recognize these conventions for what they are—a loving arrangement of our heavenly Father to strengthen and fortify us through the final days of this present system. Who would consider missing any of the spiritual gifts that Jehovah has in store for us? During our presence in the convention city and while traveling, we never want to forget that our good conduct will reflect directly on the God we worship. The motivation with which we are clothed is our deep love for Jehovah and for our brothers. May it continually prove to be “a perfect bond of union.”—Col. 3:14.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font11">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so- immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer and camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font11">At most locations, the talk for baptismal candidates will be on Saturday morning. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the questions with elders in their congregation prior to the convention. A bathing suit and towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font11">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. In all convention cities the program will begin with song and prayer on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. Late Thursday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service and so the sessions will conclude by 4:30 p.m. In the Central and Mountain time zones the program on Friday will begin at 9:30 a.m. and conclude at 4:50 p.m. On Saturday it will begin at 9:30 a.m. and conclude at 4:30 p.m. In the Eastern time zone the program on Friday and Saturday will begin at 10:20 a.m. and conclude at 5:50 p.m. on Friday and 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. In the Pacific time zone the program on Friday and Saturday will begin at 9:00 a.m. and conclude at 4:20 p.m. on Friday and 4:10 p.m. on Saturday. In all time zones on Sunday the program will begin at 9:30 a.m. and conclude at 4:10 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS: </span><span class="font11">A meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter Bethel service. Check the program at the convention city for the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font11">All </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font11"> pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only upon showing their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card. Those in Bethel service may obtain any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates at the bookroom by showing their Bethel Identification card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font11">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font11"> the lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a fine means of identification but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation as they will </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font11"> be available at the conventions. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 10c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font11">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font11"> times and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font11"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• Selective service regulations require that all men register for the draft when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of this matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian's obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have in mind when young brothers are nearing the age of 18 and give them appropriate reminders. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup>A stepping-stone can be very helpful for one to reach a desired place. Stepping-stones may help you to cross a stream or lead you to a beautiful spot in a garden or a park. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary </span><span class="font11">defines “stepping-stone&quot; as “a means of progress or advancement.” Could serving as an auxiliary pioneer be a stepping-stone in your theocratic advancement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>a</sup>As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, undoubtedly you are interested in advancing spiritually, making your progress manifest. (1 Tim. 4:15) In this regard, do you feel the need to strengthen your faith and draw closer to Jehovah? Would you like to handle the Bible with greater ease and be more confident in making door-to-door presentations? Would you like to conduct more Bible studies? Are you reaching out to become a ministerial servant or an elder? Or have you ever seriously thought about serving as a regular pioneer, a missionary or a member of the Bethel family? Auxiliary pioneering can be a stepping-stone to help you make your progress manifest. How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN IT HELP YOU?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Enjoy greater spirituality.</span><span class="font11"> 'Auxiliary pioneering will increase the time you spend </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">talking about God. </span><span class="font11">What effect can this have on you? One auxiliary pioneer said: “I am filled with joy, rejoicing, happiness, contentment, a sense of satisfaction, encouragement.” Another young auxiliary pioneer said: “I have just got baptized. I encourage all the young ones to draw closer to Jehovah.” She was able to start many studies. There is no question about it, the more you talk about Jehovah and the more you read from his Word, the more spiritually minded you become. Auxiliary pioneer service will help you advance in spirituality.—Ps. 119:97-100.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Conduct more Bible studies.</span><span class="font11"> Part of our service to Jehovah includes making disciples. This is primarily done by means of Bible studies. Therefore all should be interested in conducting Bible studies. Auxiliary pioneer service can help you. A. congregation recently reported that out of 61 publishers, 38 served as auxiliary pioneers in one month. The result? A total of 66 new studies were started! One auxiliary pioneer said: “I feel very happy because I am doing something Jehovah is pleased with. I started five new studies.” Another stated: “For the first time I have two studies. I give thanks to Jehovah who has helped me to cultivate the love needed to help people.” Regularly going in service will undoubtedly give you the opportuni-</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—A Stepping-Stone</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ty to find honest-hearted ones who would like to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Reach out to serve as a ministerial servant or an elder.</span><span class="font11"> Those who serve as elders and ministerial servants should take the lead in field service and should know how to deal with people. Meeting all kinds of individuals in field service will help you develop qualities such as patience, good judgment, reasonableness and especially the art of teaching. Learning to use the Bible effectively will be especially helpful to those serving in a position of oversight. Auxiliary pioneer service will assist brothers advancing toward this privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>e</sup> Reach out for other fields of full-time service.</span><span class="font11"> The experience you gain as an auxiliary pioneer can be very valuable training leading into regular pioneering or Bethel service. Many who are now in missionary service or special pioneer work started as auxiliary pioneers. Auxiliary pioneer service can help you see how to schedule your time most efficiently. You too can learn to arrange your personal affairs to qualify for full-time service privileges. Have you thought about reaching out for a career in full-time service? Auxiliary pioneer service can be the stepping-stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Draw close to Jehovah with strong faith.</span><span class="font11"> In this day and age we cannot consider lightly the need to be strong in the faith and close to Jehovah. Auxiliary pioneering will help keep you from slipping off into the “torrent” of this wicked world by filling your time with wholesome and righteous works. Take advantage of this provision because ‘the drawing near to God is good for you. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah you have placed your refuge, to declare all his works.’—Ps. 73:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">' • May your desire to progress in Jehovah’s service be accomplished. Prayerfully consider auxiliary pioneer service as a steppingstone for further advancement in doing his will.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By Developing Magazine Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus’ famous words “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth” help us appreciate that we need spiritual food not just occasionally but on a regular basis. Consequently, our regularly providing people in the territory with spiritual food is essential to their spiritual development and growth. —Matt. 4:4; 1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Some have found that a magazine route helps to develop the interest of sheeplike ones, moving them to feed on God’s Word regularly. This has proved to be very effective in business territories where an extensive witness cannot be given. Where mail service is unreliable and people are reluctant to subscribe, magazine routes have been the answer. There are many good reasons to give serious consideration to developing a magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DEVELOP A MAGAZINE ROUTE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> First, develop the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">habit</span><span class="font11"> of keeping a good house-to-house record. Write down ALL magazine placements when in door-to-door work. When working business territory, write down the person’s name, the address where he works and, if an office building, the floor, the room number, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The information on your house-to-house record will help you to determine the order in which to make the return visits. This will cut down on needless walking or traveling between calls and will save you time.

<p><span class="font11">children get firmly set on the way to life. But if your service is primarily limited to the family study, what about others who may be lovers of righteousness? Can you help them also by having a larger share in the public ministry? (Rom. 10: 14, 15) You will find much joy as you reach out to bring the good news to others in your area. And having started, look for ways to enlarge your service. We all know that the more we do, the greater the results will be. Are you satisfied that your present level of activity represents whole-souled service? When you make arrangements for field service, why plan on one hour of service if your circumstances permit you to do more? —Gal. 6:9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In some areas the brothers reeach time that you make your route calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’What else is required for successful magazine-route work? Review your house-to-house record and determine which articles you are going to feature. Think in terms of what will appeal to each householder. For example, if you spoke with a young person, you may want to use the series “Young People Ask . . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Magazine-route calls should be made every two weeks. Not all calls will develop into route calls. However, some will be glad to see you again. Do not get discouraged if you have only a few names at first. As time goes by, you will eliminate those who do not want to receive the magazines regularly and you will add new ones who show interest.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PRESENT THE MAGAZINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Generally it is best to be brief and call the householder’s attention to one article </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">only.</span><span class="font11"> This is especially important in business territory. You may simply say: “I am glad to see you again. The latest </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> have arrived and I am pleased to bring your copies for the usual contribution. I thought you would be particularly interested in reading this article. [Point to article.] If you have some questions on the information, I will be glad to discuss them with you on my next call.” Cultivating interest in this way may result in a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">' How thankful we are that we have such marvelous instruments as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">for helping people become disciples of Christ! May we regularly feed honest-hearted ones the truth of God’s Word by developing magazine routes in our territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">port that they just get a good start in the service, only to run out of territory. Then what can be done? In city territory, there is usually opportunity to do street work, approaching others with the message. And usually if you plan for it, you will have some return visits or not-at-homes that could be called on. So let us try to extend our service as much as we can. How often have we heard of publishers finding someone really interested when they worked a little longer than they originally planned? One sister missed meeting the group for service altogether, but she did not give up. She started approaching people on the streets, and when she finished a few hours later she found she had done very well, having witnessed to many persons and placed more literature than usual.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• When and how should Scriptural questions be referred to the Society?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every year the Society’s office in Brooklyn receives thousands of questions on various matters or requests for counsel in dealing with problems. These are received by letter as well as by telephone. We are pleased to be of help to our brothers in time of need. However, this puts a heavy burden on our office force. Many of the questions received deal with matters treated quite thoroughly in our literature, and many problems presented could often be cared for best by local elders atquainted with local circumstances.—1 Pet. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Therefore we recommend that when you have a question you first look up the matter in the Society’s publications by using the subject and Scripture sections in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font11"> or approach a local elder with your question. Further, when you have a problem on which you need counsel, it would be advisable first to seek counsel from the local elders. If your efforts in this regard do not provide you with the needed explanation or counsel, then you may direct the matter to our office. This should preferably be done by a letter in which you state all the facts clearly. Please do not use the telephone unless it is a very urgent matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You may wish to refer to the Question Box in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> of October 1974, if available, for additional comments on the question: “How can we get help to solve a personal problem?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORKING WITH OTHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• Our sacrifices of praise involve not just ourselves but others we can help. Perhaps some of these are persons already coming to the Kingdom Hall. In many congregations there are persons who appreciate the truth and attend meetings quite regularly, yet who have not shared in the field ministry. If you know that they qualify to share in field service, why not encourage them to come along with you? Help them share the desire of the apostle Paul “to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.” (Col. 1:10) This way they can share with you and your family in offering a sacrifice of praise to Jehovah. —Rom. 12:1.</span></p>

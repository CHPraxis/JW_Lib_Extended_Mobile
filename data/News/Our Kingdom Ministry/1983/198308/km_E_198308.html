<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PEAK IN MEMORIAL ATTENDANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Memorial attendance this year is another indication that many people appreciate Jehovah’s provision for salvation through Jesus Christ. As shown below, compared with last year, over 74,000 more persons attended the Memorial in the U.S. on March 29, 1983. All who were present at that event but are not yet actively associated with us need help ‘to be instructed about Jehovah’s ways and to walk in his paths.’—Isa. 2:2, 3.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was irritated at seeing the grip false religion had on the people of Athens. “Consequently he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshiped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.” (Acts 17:16, 17) In Ephesus, Paul took every advantage of his opportunities to witness by teaching publicly and from house to house.—Acts 20:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Faithful servants of Jehovah in the first century were alert to preach the good news whenever and wherever they could. Although tired out, Jesus struck up a conversation with a Samaritan woman when he was resting at a fountain. The result was that “many of the Samaritans out of that city put faith in him.” (John 4:5-42) Paul and his companions preached beside a river, with the result that Lydia and her household got baptized. (Acts 16:14, 15) We can enjoy rich blessings just as they did, when we engage in public witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> When going from house to house, do we stop to talk to persons who may be relaxing or working outside? If some are just arriving home or leaving, try to start up a conversation with them. Otherwise it may be weeks or even months</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Inactive Ones </span><span class="font9">to Grow Strong in the Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In January 1982 a special effort was started to find and help inactive ones. What have been the results? Can we do more to aid the weak or inactive? How can we encourage our brothers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> We rejoice to inform you that many formerly inactive ones are again serving shoulder to shoulder with us. They were like the psalmist who wrote: “I have wandered like a lost sheep. O look for your servant, for I have not forgotten your own commandments.” (Ps. 119:176) One sister, recognizing her loss of a close relationship with Jehovah, prayed to him for direction and the next day an elder called, offering her a Bible study. She commented: “How can I not continue to serve Him?” A very unhappy family that had become inactive due in part to the pursuit of material things was called on by two elders who offered a Bible study. They said: “This is what we were waiting for.” Now the whole family joyfully share in before they can be contacted, especially if they are seldom home—as is often true today. We want, if possible, to reach all those who reside in the territory. Try to give a brief and tactful witness, perhaps placing </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> and making arrangements to call back.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Do you have territory that is inaccessible because of doormen admitting only tenants and invited guests? Would it be possible to reach the persons living there by doing street work where the majority of the residents enter and leave the area? In this way one congregation was able to generate so much interest that a Congregation Book Study was started in a territory where it was impossible to go from house to house. Those who did street work there were alert to approach people and tactfully obtain the names and addresses of those who showed interest so that return visits could be made.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> All of us can look for opportunities to witness informally wherever we may be. When traveling by subway, bus, train, plane, car or on foot, we can often share the good news with others. Many times we find that those we speak with do not really know much about Jeho-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">service as they reduce their secular work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Indeed, the loving labors of the elders and all who have cooperated with them have been blessed by Jehovah, the Great Shepherd. (1 Pet. 2:25) A traveling overseer in Texas reports that in one area the brothers had the joy of seeing 75 reactivated, making it necessary to form a new congregation. Many circuits report 25 to over 100 reactivated. Hundreds more have begun to attend meetings again and are growing in faith through specially arranged Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Many are the expressions of gratitude from formerly “lost sheep.” When the elders called on one family, their marriage was on the verge of breaking up. The children were confused, wondering whether they were still Jehovah’s Witnesses. But the family accepted a Bible study and resumed their </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font14">15 min: “Presenting the Good News—Featuring the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> Book.” Use paragraph 1 for introduction. Demonstration of paragraphs 2 and 3 not to exceed five minutes. Then discuss with audience new Topic for Conversation and other points that may be featured in offering the book. Discuss paragraph 4 with audience and then demonstrate how brochure might be offered when householder cannot afford book. Discuss paragraph 5 with audience. Encourage all to share in field service on first Sunday of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">Arrange according to local needs. (Or discuss “Why So Many Suicides?” “Hope for Despairing Ones” and “They Want to Help” in the August 1, 1983, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> Show practical use of material in the field ministry.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">association with the congregation. The brother comments: “Now Jehovah has blessed our efforts by making us stronger spiritually. Our marriage is sturdy, and we study together as a family; we attend all meetings and now are going in service. We are so grateful for Jehovah’s patience and the help from the brothers.” Another reactivated sister happily said: “Last month I turned in my first service report in ten years. And by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness I’ll never let another month go by without some preaching.” A couple told a visiting elder: “The last two months, during which we had been studying and attending meetings, have been the happiest in our 12 years of married life.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> How can we keep on aiding the inactive? Continue making reasonable efforts to find and assist those who have strayed. Speak positively and understandingly. Pray with them. Give them reason to feel hopeful and that they are of great value in God’s eyes.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8 min: </span><span class="font14">Local announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">“Witness Publicly and From House to House.” Questions and answers. Emphasize information applicable to local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font14">“Recognizing Christ’s Role in God’s Arrangement.” Talk by elder covering material in chapter 3 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font14"> book, making local application.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">step-by-step process. Patience and long-suffering are required. When asked what helped her return, a sister commented that the one who studied with her “just would not let go.” Help them see the value of “keeping a set way” by establishing good habits of study- and service. (Ps. 50:23) All in the congregation can assist by drawing these into loving association. One reactivated one said that what helped her was “the overwhelming kindness and love the friends showed me when I returned to the meetings. We truly are one large family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> As we seek to help the inactive, let us.never forget those presently associated with us who may need help. (Acts 20:35) We can prevent many from drifting into inactivity by being interested in the spirituality of our brothers. Is there someone in your book study group that is slowing down in his service or missing meetings? Does he need some encouragement? Could you invite him to share in your family or personal study? Could you work with him in the ministry? Rather than ‘draw away’ from Jehovah through a lack of faith, let us keep exhorting one another each day. —Heb. 3:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font14">“Circuit Assemblies —Timely Reminders.” Talk. Encourage all to make definite plans to attend next circuit assembly.</span></p>

One or two should be prearranged but allow for others from audience.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Emphasis has been placed on sharing regularly in magazine activity, including street work, especially on the second and fourth Saturdays of the month if you cannot go out every Saturday. A brief presentation is usually best, perhaps from half a minute to a minute in length.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> When offering the August 1 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> we could say: “No doubt you will agree that the world is full of problems today. In fact, some individuals who felt there were just too many problems to face chose to commit suicide. The current </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> has some interesting information on this subject and helps us to appreciate that there is ‘hope for despairing ones.’ [Point to article on page 6.] We are offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> magazines for a contribution of 30 cents.

<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> After introducing ourselves, if we are highlighting the August 8 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> we might say: “Many authorities warn us that the earth is getting overcrowded. Pollution, famine and unemployment are just a few of the effects. These lead to social unrest and violence. What is the solution? Is there a government capable of handling this problem on a worldwide scale? This issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> gives you the satisfying answers, and it, along with </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> is yours for a contribution of 30 cents.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The August 15 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> may be offered by stating: “Most people agree that the world is in very serious trouble, and some wonder whether it can be saved.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Publishers who have good success placing magazines in street witnessing are usually those who take the initiative to approach people w’ith the offer. Rather than just standing and waiting for others to approach you as you display </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font14"> prepare a brief statement directing attention to a particular article and, after a friendly greeting, present the magazines. Although we would not want to obstruct the flow of traffic or rudely interrupt the conversations of others, someone waiting for a bus or unoccupied at the time may appreciate being informed on an important subject in one of the current magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> In some areas it may be advisable to have another publisher close by when engaging in street witnessing. However, if you are conversing with each other you defeat the purpose of street witnessing. So be alert to observe any interest shown in the publications you display. Have a friendly smile and cheerful greeting. Be positive in your approach. By taking the initiative in using brief, well-prepared presentations, you too may have good success in placing magazines on the streets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Short presentations can be prepared for each issue. Highlight articles that are likely to have a broad appeal. If we regularly use pointed presentations in offering the magazines from house to house, in business territory and on the streets, no doubt we will be able to accomplish much more. We want to do all we can to increase the .distribution of these two fine publications.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The circuit assembly program with the theme “Be Rich Toward God, Not Covetous” w<sup>T</sup>as appreciated because of its timely and practical reminders. Bombarded as we are with materialistic propaganda designed to stir up selfish desires, it was refreshing to consider the examples of Jesus Christ, Paul and others who did not covet material things. They were content w’ith the basic necessities while they concentrated on serving Jehovah and doing good toward others. (2 Cor. 8:9; 12:14-18) Also, the Scriptural material presented forcefully reminded us of the need to be reasonable and balanced in matters of business, health and recreation. Let us resolve never to allow lack of balance in these things to distract us from our real purpose in life.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Starting in September, a new circuit assembly program will begin with the theme “Recommending Ourselves as God’s Ministers.” (2 Cor. 6:4) What identifies a true minister of God? How can we help ourselves and our children to be truly absorbed in the ministry? How can we avoid being ensnared by self-interest? The program will show how effective ministers display the fruitage of God’s spirit when confronted with various situations. The public talk features the subject “What Future Is There for You?” The entire program should help Jehovah’s people to make the most of their ministry. All of us, along with interested persons, should benefit from such reminders.—Ps. 119:2, 24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Featuring the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font3"> Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> January and February were the first months that we featured the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font14"> in our field ministry. We enjoyed using this publication and in fact we had a new peak of publishers reporting service during January. Again in August and September we will be offering this fine book as we share the good news with others. To aid us, we have a new Topic for Conversation: “Can You Live Forever in Paradise?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> After introducing yourself, you might say: “I am sure you will agree that it does not seem possible to enjoy real happiness on earth even for a short time in view of all the problems we face, such as sickness, aging, hunger, criijie and insecurity. [Allow householder to comment.] But there are good reasons for believing that it really is possible to live forever in happiness on earth. One reason is because God promises it. Notice what it says here in Psalm 37:29. [Read verse.] But what about the causes for unhappiness that we mentioned? In Revelation 21:4 God promises to do away with them. [Read that verse.] I know you would like to learn more, and to help you •to do So, we are offering this publication.” Then proceed to show the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> You are already familiar with this book. You have used it in the field and perhaps are studying it with someone. No doubt, then, you have some fine points in mind to share with householders when you offer it. You may want to read some</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness Publicly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">vah’s Witnesses and the Kingdom message. If we place magazines or leave tracts, these can provide something for the interested person to consider further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> During August and September we will be offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book. Are there ways it can be presented publicly as well as from house to house? Yes. Some have featured the book in street work quite successfully by approaching passersby and giving a brief witness. Some have been helped to come into the truth because a brother or a sister witnessed to them at work during rest periods or their lunch break. A brother decided to present the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book to those on his magazine route. He wrote, ‘One man I have been calling on would just take the magazines and close the door. One day I of paragraph 9 on page 10 and then show the contrast between the pictures of the troubles in the world on pages 8 and 9, and the Paradise scenes on pages 11-13. If time permits, you could show some of the interesting chapter titles that you think would appeal to that particular householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> During the previous campaign, many publishers found householders who said they wanted the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book but did not have the $2.50 at the time. Some of these accepted the book when a return call was made. But sometimes when we call back the interest has cooled off, and they do not take the book. So that they are left with something to read at the first call when they do show interest, one circuit overseer found it helpful to offer the brochure </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font14"> for 25 cents when the householder could not afford the book. We could try doing that, or offering the current magazines, so that the person would have some publication to read to stimulate further his interest. And, of course, we could arrange to return with the book when the householder expects to be able to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Living in happiness on earth forever is certainly a marvelous prospect, one that is open to a great crowd without number. (Rev. 7:9) We want to do all we can to help others to share with us in having that wonderful hope. As we feature the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book in our field ministry, we want to keep this in mind and endeavor to start Bible studies with all who show interest in this promise Jehovah makes for those who love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">offered the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book. He took it and the next time I called he said he had read the first 35 pages. Many others just see the book and want it.’ Why not give thought to offering the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book to neighbors, relatives or others who are not yet serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> As recorded at Proverbs 1:20, wisdom is said to keep “giving forth its voice” in the public squares, thus making it available to all who seek it. Never before in man’s history has there been a greater need for God’s wisdom as contained in his Word to be publicly proclaimed. (Matt. 24:14) As we near the end of this present system, those held in darkness by ’it need to hear Jehovah’s Word while there is yet time. It is a marvelous privilege for us to be ‘engaged in the holy work of the good news of God,’ witnessing publicly and from house to house. —Rom. 15:16.</span></p>

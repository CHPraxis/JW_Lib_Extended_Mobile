<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Kingdom—A Reality</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> God's Kingdom by Christ Jesus is a reality. It has permanence. For just as Jehovah is the “King of eternity,&quot; his associate King, Jesus, now also has “the power of an indestructible life.” (Rev. 15:3; Heb. 7:1, 2, 15, 16) The reality of the Kingdom is shown today in the transforming effect it has on the lives of its supporters as they leave behind worldly ways and conform to the laws and principles of the Kingdom’s book of instruction, the Bible. Further clear-cut evidence that it is real is seen in the worldwide unity of those from all nations who have become subjects of the Kingdom.—Prov. 14:28; Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Recognizing the reality of the Kingdom and wanting to be obedient to the commands of its King Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s people earth wide regularly share in declaring “the good news of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 4:43) They want all to know what the Kingdom can do for people now and in the future. Too, they are most grateful that Jehovah God through his organization has equipped them with the instruments they need to proclaim</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Disciples of Your Children</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commanded his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations,.. . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28: 19, 20) There is no work more vital. It involves teaching persons so that they will come to know Jehovah and love and serve him from their hearts. Parents have an added responsibility to make disciples of their children as well.—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Making disciples of children involves many things. One of the most important of these is to have a regular family Bible study each week. When studying with an interested person, we give thought to his personality and any attitude that may hinder his spiritual growth. We draw him out and carefully listen to his response, so we will know what spiritual encouragement he needs. Concerned parents will give even more thoughtful attention to the thinking and attitudes of their children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Parents should be alert to detect any evidence of a drifting away to the world. If, as adult Christians, we have to be alert to this danger ourselves, how much more do we need to be sure our children progress spiritually. When children his Kingdom to others.—Heb. 13: 20, 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE WATCHTOWER—ANNOUNCING JEHOVAH'S KINGDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> One of the most helpful instruments put in their hands is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> It has championed God’s Kingdom for more than a hundred years. Moreover, it has kept watch by calling attention to Scriptural warnings to “keep awake” spiritually. It has alerted its readers as to how present-day wars, famines, pestilences and other happenings serve as indicators that these are the “critical times” marking “the last days” of this system of things.—Matt. 24:14; Luke 21:10-17, 36; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Similarly, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> while carrying articles on a variety of subjects, most importantly builds confidence in the Creator's promise of a peaceful and secure New Order within our generation, under the rule of God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The effect that these outstanding magazines have had on subscribers is well illustrated by the comments of one couple who wrote: “We have always read and loved </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">’ (Continued on page 1, col. 1) </span><span class="font13">fail to comment at meetings or always read a simple answer from the paragraph, they need parental help. During your family study have them select paragraphs to comment on and help them prepare the answer in their own words. By using leading questions, help them to reason on Scriptural matters. Impress upon them Jehovah’s goodness and love and their accountability to him in all things.—Prov. 1:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Each day, a child is confronted with new ideas at school both during classes and in association with fellow students. Not all of these are wholesome. Because of lack of experience, children may accept false values, and gradually the spirit of the world may begin to erode the spiritual foundation the parent is trying to build. Each day, parents are confronted with the task of finding out what has been planted in their children’s minds, uprooting what is wrong and replacing it with the wholesome truths found in God’s Word. This requires much careful thought and constant attention on the part of the parents if they are going to make disciples of</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 2 </span><span class="font13">Song 57</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Pertinent Announcements and local announcements. Encourage magazine activity on second Saturday of the month. If time allows, include talking points from latest magazines. 20 min: &quot;God’s Kingdom—A Reality.” Question-and-answer discussion. Review some specific points from insert of April 1983 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> “Subscriptions—'Wisdom Calling Out’!” to show how subscriptions may be obtained. Let audience tell what points from this material have been helpful to them and how they will use points during the month of October. 15 min: “Some Adjustments in the Use of Various Forms.” Talk by elder, explaining adjustments to extent necessary for benefit of publishers. Remind brothers to bring </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School </span><span class="font13">brochure with them to next week’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 64 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Song 73</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 mfn: Local announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">17 min: “Make Disciples of Your Children.” Discuss material with audience, stressing urgent need to apply suggestions now. Interview some parents as to how they will implement the suggestions in their own home. If available, interview parents who have successfully raised chil</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">their children.—2 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 6:10-18; 1 Pet. 5:8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Now that your children are back to school, have you equipped them with the spiritual armor that they need in order to “quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles”? (Eph. 6:16) Do they understand basic issues they may face, such as Christian neutrality, flag salute, holidays and evolution, clearly enough so that they can logically explain them to others? As they grow older, are you equipping them to make the right decisions regarding bad associations, dating, drugs and sexual immorality? It will not be easy, but by diligent effort you can succeed in helping them to grow spiritually throughout their school years.—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> In the early years, put before your children theocratic goals, —regular pioneering, Bethel service or missionary work. Encourage your children to auxiliary pioneer during school vacations. How happy Hannah was to receive many blessings from Jehovah as a redren, following thoughts similar to those expressed in the article.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Consider the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font13"> brochure, pages 5, 30 and 31, “Cooperation With the School System.” This should principally be a talk with some question-and-answer discussion regarding parents’ responsibility toward the children. They should not simply send their young ones off to school and let the secular authorities take care of their, schooling. Parents have the major responsibility for the education of their children, even as the brochure notes. Discuss the practical ways that a parent can cooperate with the school system for the benefit of his child’s education. Emphasize the importance of meeting with the teacher and discussing matters. If available, have a Witness mother who has had experience in talking to her children’s teachers demonstrate how such a profitable meeting can be arranged and handled. Remind brothers to bring </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font13"> book next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 9 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING OCTOBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 66</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">20 min: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> pages 41-54. Talk by well-qualified elder, with questions and answers particularly on material under subheadings &quot;Congregation sult of giving her firstborn to Jehovah’s service. (1 Sam. 2:18-21) Today many theocratic parents rejoice in having one or more of their children serving faithfully in some branch of full-time service. They know this serves as a protection for their children, as well as for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah richly blesses those who serve him wholeheartedly. (Prov. 10:22) How wise are all parents who encourage their children to apply Jesus’ counsel to put Kingdom interests first.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> One of the best ways to train a child is by example. Words without corresponding action have little lasting effect upon a child. Parents are the prime example a youngster imitates. When you encourage him to put Kingdom interests first, if he is to be properly motivated, you must reflect this in your actions. If the child is encouraged to pioneer, then his parents should take the field ministry seriously, doing as much as they reasonably can, auxiliary pioneering from time to time if possible. There cannot be two Book Study Conductor” and “Benefiting Individually,” pages 43-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">“Presenting the Good News —By Street Witnessing and Magazine Routes.” Question-and-answer discussion. Briefly demonstrate how street witnessing should be done and how to start a magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Encourage witnessing with magazines on fourth Saturday of the month. Suggest talking points in current magazines.

<p><span class="font13">20 min: “Improving Our Teaching Ability—By Demonstrating Personal Concern.” Question-and-answer discussion. Give practical illustrations of what can be done through personal attention to help Bible students draw close to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Consider </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font13"> brochure on “Holidays and Celebrations.” Use introductory material of this section and the material on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Halloween</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">All Saints’ Day;</span><span class="font13"> additional material from our publications may be introduced as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Experiences in obtaining subscriptions, placing magazines or using </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font13"> brochure this month.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Family study should be taken seriously and never allowed to become a hit-or-miss affair, studying together only when nothing else comes up. Those parents who work hard to set a fine example themselves and make disciples of their children accordingly can rejoice as they see them grow in love for Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Raising a family in the truth is a real challenge for parents in these last days. Truly these are “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1-5) We recognize that the world is trying to squeeze our children into its mold. We know that those conforming to it will be cast off by Jehovah: (Rom. 1: 28-32) How vital then that we exert ourselves vigorously to make disciples of our children even as we work hard to help our neighbors lay hold on the prize of the “life now and that which is to come”! — 1 Tim. 4:8b.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL SCHEDULE FOR 1984</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INSTRUCTIONS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">During 1984 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, Bible Topics for Discussion</span><span class="font12"> [td], and the books </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot;</span><span class="font12"> [si] and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font12"> [sg] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder if possible, or, when necessary, by a qualified ministerial servant. When based on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</span><span class="font12"> this should be delivered as a 10-minute instruction talk followed by a 5-minute oral review. Since a part of a study is assigned from this book, the brother handling this assignment should be careful to cover only the portion of the material that is assigned. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font12"> of the information being discussed. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When based on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,&quot;</span><span class="font12"> this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review following. Once again, the Objective is not just to summarize the material but rather to focus attention on the practical value of the information, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. The brother handling Assignment No. 1 should be given private counsel, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder assigned by him. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font12"> overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font12"> the information is of value to us. To the extent possible include the audience in the discussion. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. Of course, nondedicated persons who are leading lives that conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font12"> the assigned verses should actually be read. The material may also be presented by a boy reading it to a qualified older brother who may then use questions to draw comments from the boy on the value of the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to a sister, including younger ones, whenever possible. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field ministry, in the congregation or elsewhere. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience. This should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip.* Rather he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. In addition, comments on informative and practical points that the students may not have included in the presentation can help to keep the attention of all focused primarily on the Scriptural information presented. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than two minutes for counsel and remarks after each student talk. If the student speaker merits only a “G&quot; and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle a speech quality the student should work on next, doing so in the box where the “G,” “I” or “W” would normally appear. It would be advisable for those giving talks to sit toward the front of the hall. This will help to save time, and also it will enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the qiaterial in the allotted time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the counsel and remarks of the school overseer. Talks Nos. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If the school overseer assigns someone to give the “stop signal,&quot; that one should be advised as to the importance of doing this whenever a talk goes overtime. If a brother handling Assignment No. 1 goes overtime, he should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, not counting song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically, a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper, and in reading off all the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 75 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it is necessary, sisters may take any student talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talk No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ABSENTEES: The entire congregation can show appreciation for this school by being present, when possible, at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">It is hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. If a</span><span class="font12"> student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or, the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

Then when we received </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> the key to the Bible’s message came into our hands. It has meant so much to us.” Another person was moved to write: “The day </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> first came into my home, I read it and immediately a window was opened toward a wonderful future. I had always been taught such things as immortality of the soul, fiery hell and Trinity.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">• Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> also lends its support to Kingdom pro-claimers. The April issue had an excellent insert on obtaining subscriptions. It urged us to have a positive attitude. Was it helpful? Judge for yourselves by the results of the subscription campaign in April and May of this year. A year ago during the spring subscription campaign we obtained 167,253 subscriptions. During the same period this year we obtained 269,536, or 102,283 more. You will find it helpful to review the April insert as we enter our new campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ How appropriate that during the months of October and November we will again offer a one-year subscription to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> for $3.50 each or $7.00 for the two. By reading these magazines along with the Bible, many thousands of persons in all parts of the earth have come to accept the reality of God’s Kingdom and to give it their loyal support. Because God’s Kingdom is the only solution to the problems that distress mankind, we should be moved to have a full share in distributing these magazines, which proclaim the Kingdom. The lives of others are at stake. It is our united prayer that Jehovah will bless our efforts to help many more persons to submit themselves to his Kingdom by Christ Jesus, to their lasting joy and eternal welfare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Our Teaching Ability —By Demonstrating Personal Concern</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Feed my little sheep.” (John 21:17) With those words, Jesus emphasized his genuine love and personal concern for sheeplike ones who need to be spiritually fed the Word of truth. Three times Jesus stressed to Peter that, by ministering to others, he would be demonstrating his love for the Messiah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus proved himself a real friend and an affectionate companion to his followers, ‘loving them to the end.’ (John 13:1) As imitators of him, we need to display similar personal concern toward prospective new disciples, sharing with them the vital truths of God’s Word. (Matt. 28: 19, 20) There are several ways we can do this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THEM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Personal concern can be shown by inviting Bible students to the meetings and making arrangements for their transportation when necessary. By being generous, kind and hospitable, we help our students to see true Christianity at work. Godly qualities are contagious and often engender a spirit similar to that which we display toward them, resulting in the development of fine, close friendships based on principled love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Showing interest in our Bible students on occasions other than during the formal study can also be most rewarding. As the students advance in the truth, some publishers show hospitality by inviting them to tl}eir homes where they find wholesome, theocratic fellowship. Inviting other publishers on such occa</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Adjustments in the Use of Various Forms</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As part of an effort toward simplification, the Governing Body has approved a number of adjustments regarding the use of handbills and Memorial invitations as well as programs and lapel cards for circuit assemblies. These adjustments are designed to save many man-hours of work for the Society and to cut down on some of the work load for local overseers. Additionally, considerable expense will be eliminated without diminishing the effectiveness of the Kingdom-preaching work or our ministering to the needs of the congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Handbills for the special spring talk and those for circuit assembly public talks are being discontinued, but the handbills advertising weekly congregation meetings will still be available, and all congregations are encouraged to keep a good supply of these on hand for use in the field. Also beginning with 1984, it will not be necessary for congregations to order Memorial invitations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A standard Memorial invitation for all congregations will be providsions contributes to their making new friends. (Read Mark 10:29, 30.) Such theocratic association can aid their growth to Christian maturity and help them cultivate good habits. (Prov. 13:20; compare 1 Corinthians 15:33.) As they fellowship with us and observe our fine Christian conduct, undoubtedly they will see that we are not just preaching the Word of God but living by it, making it a way of life.—Jas. 1:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Occasionally, we may feel that our students are not making the progress we expect of them. What should we do? We should lovingly assist them in the areas where help is needed the most. If they have difficulty overcoming certain weaknesses, search out from the Society’s publications helpful reference material that bears on the problem and share it with them. Also, pray </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font13"> them about the matter. (Compare James 5:16.) Help them build a real dependence upon Jehovah, an appreciation for the need to pray regularly and the need to act in harmony with those prayers.—1 Pet. 3:12; 1 John 3:22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Demonstrating personal concern requires patience and love on our part. But how rewarding this is when we see those with whom we have studied “glorify the word of Jehovah&quot; and become “believers”! Like the faithful disciples who taught those new ones in apostolic times, we too will be “filled with joy and holy spirit.”—Acts 13:48, 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ed. The invitations will be distinctive each year. They will be consigned in sufficient quantities, based on the number of copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> that are sent to each congregation. These invitations are not to be reordered. Congregations will be billed at the rate of $1.25 for each package of 450 invitations. The Memorial invitations for April 15, 1984, will be mailed separately, but starting in August of next year, they will be sent along with the regular shipment of forms and other congregation supplies. Since these standard Memorial invitations will simply show the date and give the time for the celebration as after sundown, they will be used in conjunction with the regular congregation meeting handbills. In offering the Memorial invitation to an interested person, the publisher can supply any additional information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> These adjustments will represent great savings in time, work and expense for all concerned. However, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Street Witnessing and Magazine Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* From the very beginning of the modern work of Jehovah’s Witnesses, magazines have been used to help “hungry” ones to learn the truth. At first this was done basically through subscriptions, but in January 1940 some new methods of placing magazines were proposed. It was suggested to the 67,000 publishers then associated in the United States that individual copies be offered on the streets and through magazine routes. What was the result? The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">191(1 Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> answers: “Individual magazines to the amount of nearly 3,000,000 were distributed in this manner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Last year with over 600,000 publishers in the field, over 80 million magazines were distributed in the United States. Many of these were placed in the regular door-to-door work. Perhaps this is how you shared in distributing them. Could you reach even more who are hungering for the truth by placing magazines on busy streets and on a magazine route? Have you tried these methods yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STREET WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Many publishers and pioneers do street witnessing near transportation centers early in the morning when people are on their way to work. One sister approached a woman from a foreign country, and the woman was delighted to have the magazines. She asked if someone could study with her in her language, as she had been searching for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Now she is feeding regularly at Jehovah’s table.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Two sisters, while waiting for the rest of the group to finish door-to-door work on a Sunday, approached people on a busy street and placed over 20 magazines each in just a few minutes. One of the sisters placed a book with a college professor who commented that he was searching for</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">there will be further simplifications regarding circuit assemblies. In addition to discontinuing the use of handbills for circuit assembly public talks, we will use standard circuit assembly programs for the series beginning in February 1984. Circuit overseers are being informed about the procedure to follow in ordering such programs. Use of lapel cards at circuit assemblies is being discontinued. However, lapel cards will continue to be used at district conventions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> As the Kingdom work continues the truth and even wanted more material, in addition to the magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> How did these publishers place so many magazines? They </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">approached </span><span class="font13">people walking along the street and those in parked cars. Smiling warmly, they directed attention to a particular article in the magazine that they thought might interest the person. They were, in fact, witnessing from person to person rather than simply standing or walking along holding up magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE ROUTES</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Publishers who are successful in establishing magazine routes say that the first essential is regularity in magazine activity. Upon placing magazines from door to door, they suggest to the person: “If you enjoy these issues, you may wish to have succeeding copies, and so I will stop by in two weeks to give you the opportunity to obtain the next issues.” Others refer to “In Our Next Issue” and point out the interesting articles that will appear. They may say, “I’m looking forward to reading this article when it comes out. Perhaps you would like to read it too.” Some refer to the articles that appear as regular features,, such as “Young People Ask” or “God’s Word Is Alive.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ When making commitments to call again, it is important to be sure that you return. Your own consistency in returning on your magazine route can build up a warm, friendly relationship between you and the householder, and there will be a greater readiness to obtain the magazines. Some who have magazine routes find that a good time to call is in the early evening just after the householder has returned from secular work. Others make their route calls on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Whether on the street or on magazine routes, let us take advantage of all opportunities to get the magazines into the hands of the people. —Ps. 107:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">to expand and increase throughout the earth, it becomes more important for us to make the most efficient use of all of our resources and energies. We want to accomplish the most good with the talents and assets that Jehovah has entrusted to our care. (Compare Ecclesiastes 10:10.) The fine support that all the brothers are giving to the preaching work today is greatly appreciated by the Society. It must bring joy to Jehovah’s heart. No doubt these new arrangements will have Jehovah’s blessing and prove to be advantageous in accomplishing the work ahead.</span></p>

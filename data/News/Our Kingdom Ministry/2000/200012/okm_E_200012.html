<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fear Jehovah All Day Long</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (Ps. Ill: 10) It stimulates us to do good works and helps us to turn away from what is bad. (Prov. 16:6) This fear is a profound reverence for our Creator, moving us to shun displeasing and disobeying him. It is something that we need to cultivate and display all day long.—Prov. 8:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Every day, the spirit of Satan's world exerts tremendous pressure on us to conform to its evil ways. (Eph. 6:11, 12) Our imperfect flesh is sinful and naturally tends toward what is bad. (Gal. 5:17) Hence, to obey Jehovah’s commandments, be happy, and gain life, we have to fear him all day long.—Deut. 10: 12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> At Hebrews 10:24, 25, we are admonished to gather together so as to encourage one another “all the more so” during these times in which we live. Regular meeting attendance is vital if we are to survive these last days. Our fear of displeasing God moves us to attend meetings and value their purpose highly. Those who fear God view sharing in Christian meetings as a sacred privilege.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Obeying the command to preach the good news of the Kingdom is another way that we display our fear of God. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 10:42) A primary goal of our preaching work is to help others cultivate the fear of Jehovah and submit to his will. We accomplish this by making return visits, endeavoring to start home Bible studies, and then teaching others all the commandments of God. We thereby demonstrate our fear of Jehovah and our love of neighbor.—Matt. 22:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Those not fearing God fail to develop an appreciative attitude toward spiritual things, and they succumb to the world’s deadly air, or mental attitude. (Eph. 2:2) May our firm resolve be to “render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.” (Heb. 12:28) We will thus reap the blessings of those who fear Jehovah all day long.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Preach With Boldness?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Despite being arrested and threatened by opposers, Peter and John continued declaring the Kingdom message with boldness. (Acts 4:17,21,31) What does it mean for us today to preach with boldness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Boldly Giving a Witness: </span><span class="font9">A synonym for “bold” is “intrepid,” which means having “resolute fearlessness, fortitude, and endurance.” For true Christians, preaching with boldness means being unafraid to speak up whenever there is an appropriate occasion to share the good news with others. (Acts 4: 20; 1 Pet. 3:15) It means that we are not ashamed of the good news. (Ps. 119:46; Rom. 1:16; 2 Tim. 1:8) Thus, boldness is a quality needed to accomplish our commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom in this time of the end. It moves us to share the good news with people wherever they may be found.—Acts 4:29; 1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Boldness at School: </span><span class="font9">Does an inclination to be fearful or timid make it difficult to preach to your schoolmates? At times it is not easy; in fact, it can be a real challenge. However, Jehovah will strengthen you if you pray for boldness to preach to others. (Ps. 138:3) Boldness will help you to identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and to withstand ridicule. As a result, your preaching at school may save those who listen to you.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Boldness at Work: </span><span class="font9">Are you known as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses at work? The only way your workmates can be reached with the good news may be by your preaching to them. Your boldness will also help you to get time off for your Christian meetings and conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Bold When Under Trial: </span><span class="font9">Mustering up boldness is crucial when we face opposition. (1 Thess. 2:1, 2) It helps us to hold fast to our faith when we are subjected to threats, ridicule, or outright persecution. (Phil. 1:27, 28) It fortifies us to stand firm when under pressure to compromise our adherence to the standards of our God, Jehovah. It strengthens us to maintain our peaceableness when others provoke disputes.—Rom. 12:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Whatever difficulties we personally face, may we persevere in preaching the good news with boldness.—Eph. 6: 18-20.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>2001 “Teachers of God’s Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The prophet Isaiah described Jehovah as the Grand Instructor, who in a fatherly way urges: “This is the way. Walk in it, you people.” (Isa. 30:20, 21) But how do we hear Jehovah’s words spoken for our benefit? Jehovah speaks to his people through the pages of the Bible as well as Bible-based publications, meetings, circuit events, and district conventions provided by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45) We can be thankful to Jehovah that he continues to direct us in the way in which we should walk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Each year, the district convention provides us with the opportunity to gather with fellow believers and listen attentively to Jehovah’s instructions. Last year, 1,428,139 persons attended the spiritually refreshing “Doers of God’s Word” District Conventions. In 2001, three-day “Teachers of God’s Word” District Conventions will be held throughout the country. We know that you are looking forward to making your arrangements to attend, so we are providing the following instructions to assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Making Your Hotel Reservation: </span><span class="font9">To prevent hotels from overcharging the brothers and sisters attending the convention, the Society gives direction regarding acceptable room rates to the local Rooming Department in each convention city. All hotels that cooperate with these roomrate policies are placed on the Recommended Lodging List, a copy of which is sent to each congregation. However, you will notice that hotels included on the list one year may not be included the following year. This usually happens for one of three reasons:. (1) Hotel personnel have decided that they will not offer room rates that are acceptable to the Society. (2) The Rooming Department has chosen to list a different hotel for reasons of price or location. (3) The hotel has fallen below the Society’s standards for cleanliness and/or safety.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The Society would like to continue holding our conventions in convenient convention cities. Because the Society and the local Rooming Department have your long-term interests at heart, each year we ask that you make reservations only at hotels that are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">currently</span><span class="font9"> working with the Watchtower Convention. By the first week in January, your congregation will have received the Recommended Lodging List for your convention. When making your reservation, carefully follow the instructions in this insert in the box entitled “Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation.” Because of fire and safety regulations, you should arrange for no more than four persons in each room. If a particular hotel permits more than four persons to a room, this will be clearly indicated on the Recommended Lodging List under the heading “Adults.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font9">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Sunday 9:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Be sure that you have called </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> the hotels on the Recommended Lodging List before informing your congregation secretary that there are no rooms available. Using the address or telephone number shown at the top of the list, he will contact the Rooming Department and advise them of the situation. A revised list will be sent to your congregation. Rather than making a reservation at a hotel not on the list, wait for the new list. Once you have made a reservation, please do not switch your reservation to another hotel. Hotels are added because there are brothers and sisters who still need rooms, not to provide more choices for those who already have rooms reserved. Following this direction gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our love for our Christian brothers and to avoid the world’s me-first attitude.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Sending Deposits to Hotels, and Handling Hotel Problems: </span><span class="font9">To guarantee a room reservation, within ten days of making your reservation, a one-night deposit must be made for each room reserved. Without a deposit the hotel has the right to give your room to someone else. Any difficulties experienced before or after the convention may be reported by writing or calling the Rooming Department, using the address or telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. If a problem arises during the convention, you should go to the convention Rooming Department as soon as possible so that the brothers can assist you before you check out of the hotel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Caring for Those With Special Needs: </span><span class="font9">The elderly, the infirm, those in full-time service, or others may require assistance in attending the convention. Relatives, the elders, and others in the congregation who are aware of the unique circumstances of those with special needs can lovingly make the necessary arrangements. The responsibility of family and congregation should not be shifted to the convention organization. (1 Tim. 5:4) The Society’s Special Needs Room Request form outlines the qualifications for submitting this form. The Congregation Service Committee should review each applicant’s qualifications before forwarding this form to the Rooming Department. The congregation secretary should include his telephone number on the form so that the Rooming Department can contact him if there are any questions. The approved forms should be mailed to the convention address shown on the reverse side of the form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font9">If you need a Recommended Lodging List or information for another convention, the congregation secretary can provide you with the address of the convention headquarters, which is found on the reverse side of the Special Needs Room Request form. Always enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your request. If there is more than one convention held in that city, be sure to indicate the dates of the convention you will attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> How Do Hotel Personnel Feel About Jehovah’s Witnesses? </span><span class="font9">After commenting on the good behavior of Jehovah’s people, the general manager of a hotel in the Midwest said: “When I see Jehovah’s Witnesses checking in on Thursday, I ‘check out’ until Monday morning. I know that any problems will be minor. It is always a pleasure to have your people here.” A hotel salesperson exclaimed: “Wonderful group! Everyone just kept saying, ‘Thank you.’ ” Does it not make you proud to hear our brothers spoken of in this way? Imagine how happy Jehovah God is when he sees us acting in a way that brings praise to his name!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Conclusion: </span><span class="font9">As the time draws near for you to attend your district convention, make it a matter of prayer to Jehovah that you can be in attendance </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">at all sessions on all three days</span><span class="font9"> and derive the most benefit from the program. Have you already requested time off from work for the three days of the convention you plan to attend? If you have not, do so as soon as possible. Lastminute requests for time off from work usually are not granted. The faithful and discreet slave has arranged this year’s “Teachers of God’s Word” District Convention to provide for our spiritual instruction and to build up our faith. So start making your plans now to be in attendance, following the psalmist’s admonition: “In congregated throngs bless God”!—Ps. 68:26.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Theocratic Ministry School for 2001</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">'There are ample Scriptural reasons why all of us should participate as fully as possible in the Theocratic Ministry School.—Prov. 15:23; Matt. 28: 19,20; Acts 15:32; 1 Tim. 4:12,13; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> A program for weekly Bible reading has long been a feature of the school. It amounts to reading about one page of the Bible each day. Beginning this year, a Bible reading is also assigned for each written review week. The supplemental Bible reading, which was scheduled for the past three years, has been completed. But if you wish to read more of the Bible than is scheduled, you may make up your own reading program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Assignment No. 2 trains brothers for “public reading” of God’s Word. (1 Tim. 4:13) When you have a reading assignment, practice it aloud again and again. You might use the Society’s audiocassette recordings of the Bible to improve your pronunciation, modulation, and other aspects of good reading.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 are based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font9">book, which was prepared for use in the field ministry. If the assigned material is more than you can consider within the allotted time, select only what will be most practical for your congregation territory. Any setting that is appropriate for your territory may be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Make every reasonable effort to fulfill all your assignments in the school. Take the time to prepare well, and speak from your heart. You will be a source of encouragement to the congregation, and you will benefit personally by participating wholeheartedly in the Theocratic Ministry School during 2001.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Peer Pressure and Your Privilege to Preach</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Peer pressure is a powerful influence—for good or for bad. Fellow servants of Jehovah exert a positive influence that incites us to fine Christian works. (Heb. 10:24) However, non-Witness family members, workmates, schoolmates, neighbors, or other acquaintances can put pressure on us to follow a course that is contrary to Christian principles. They may speak “slightingly of [our] good conduct in connection with Christ.” (1 Pet. 3:16) How can we maintain our determination to keep preaching despite negative peer pressure that we may encounter?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Family Members: </span><span class="font9">At times, a husband and father who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses may not want his wife and children to share in the public ministry. This was the situation in a household in Mexico. A man’s wife and seven children came into the truth. At first he was opposed because he did not want his family to preach and offer Bible literature from house to house. He felt that this was beneath their dignity. His wife and children, however, stood firm in their decision to serve Jehovah and to have a regular share in the ministry. In time, the man began to see the value of accepting God’s arrangement for the preaching work, and he too dedicated himself to Jehovah. It took him 15 years to accept the truth, but would he have ever done so had his family not persevered in their privilege to preach?—Luke 1:74; 1 Cor. 7:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Workmates: </span><span class="font9">Your efforts to witness to workmates may not be well received by some. One sister related that when a discussion about the end of the world arose in the office, she was ridiculed because she suggested that they read Matthew chapter 24. However, a few days later, one of her workmates told her that she had read the chapter and was impressed. A publication was placed, and arrangements were made for a Bible study with her and her husband. The first study lasted until two o’clock in the morning. Following the third study, they started attending meetings, and soon thereafter they gave up the use of tobacco and began sharing in the ministry. Would this have happened if our sister had made no effort to share her hope with others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Schoolmates: </span><span class="font9">It is not unusual for Witness youths to experience peer pressure at school and to be afraid that other youths will belittle them for sharing in the preaching work. One Christian teenager in the United States said: “I had a fear of witnessing to other young people because I was afraid of being made fun of.” So she avoided opportunities to witness to her peers at school and in the territory. How can you develop the strength to stand up to peer pressure? Trust in Jehovah, seeking his smile of approval. (Prov. 29:25) Take pride in your ability to use the Word of God in your ministry. (2 Tim. 2:15) The youth just quoted began praying to Jehovah, asking him to help her cultivate the desire to talk to her schoolmates. She began witnessing informally at school, had good results, and was soon talking to everyone she knew. She concluded: “Those kids need and want a hope for the future, and Jehovah is using us to help them.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Neighbors: </span><span class="font9">We may have neighbors or other acquaintances who show some irritation toward us because of who we are and what we stand for. If you fear what they think, ask yourself: ‘Do they know the truth that leads to everlasting life? What can I do to reach their hearts?’ A circuit overseer observed that good results are achieved when witnessing to neighbors in measured doses. Beseech Jehovah for the needed strength and wisdom to continue seeking out honesthearted ones. —Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Our yielding to negative peer pressure may please opposers, but would doing so be in their best interests—or ours? Jesus was opposed by people in his own community. He even endured sharp remarks by his half brothers. But he knew that he could help them only by remaining true to the course God had set for him. Thus, Jesus “endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests.” (Heb. 12:2, 3) We must do the same. Be determined to make the most of your privilege to preach the Kingdom message. By doing so, “you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

A brief comment, perhaps on the cover illustration, may be sufficient. Many householders readily accept the journals from our youngsters, often commenting favorably about the sincerity and good conduct of these youths. With a little help, this service is something children can do very well, making a valuable contribution in spreading the Kingdom message. Of course, as children grow older, their parents will want to help them continue to make progress in developing their witnessing skills.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> The urgency of our ministry is impressed upon us by an important fact-^-the outbreak of the great tribulation will come while we are still engaged in this work.

(Eph. 6:18)tO’he scope of the preaching activity continues to expand. But one day soon? the greatest witness work in human history will reach a climax.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Faithfully follow the command of Jesus to “keep awake.” This is more critical now than ever before. May we respond with a sense, of urgency.

Although he is still very young, Manuel’s enthusiasm for the ministry is a source of real encouragement to his parents and to the entire congregation.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to review pointed counsel from this month’s insert. Encourage everyone to take a few minutes to look at the printed program before each morning and afternoon session begins and anticipate what might be discussed. This will make it easier to focus attention on the program and take brief but meaningful notes. Two to four weeks following the convention, a 30-minute review of program highlights is to be scheduled on the Service Meeting. At that time, each one will be prepared to volunteer a brief comment when invited to do so by three qualified brothers assigned to handle this part. Such comments may express how what was learned at the convention applies to one’s own life and in one’s field ministry. One or two selected, brief experiences may be related. Good preparation by all is the key to making this Service Meeting part both interesting and instructive.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Do You Appreciate Sacred Things?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> When asked whether we appreciate sacred things, likely we would quickly answer yes! What are some of God’s sacred provisions that we appreciate?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> How dearly we cherish the personal relationship we are allowed to have with our heavenly Father! He assures us that if we ‘draw close to him, he will draw close to us.’ (Jas. 4:8) Without the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, no man could receive everlasting life. (John 3: 16) Out of sincere gratefulness, we daily express in prayer our deep appreciation for this precious gift of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> God’s inspired Word, the Holy Bible, is also sacred to us, as is Jehovah’s earthly organization. We show due appreciation for these provisions from Jehovah when we live by Bible principles, strengthen the bonds of brotherly love, carefully observe theocratic order, and cooperate with those taking the lead.—1 Pet. 1:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Through the faithful and discreet slave, we receive an abundance of spiritual food. That will be true this year at the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention. There we will receive vital instruction and enjoy warm fellowship that we urgently need. How can we show heartfelt appreciation for this sacred provision?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Do Not Neglect Jehovah’s House: </span><span class="font8">Nehemiah admonished those who had worked hard to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls ‘not to neglect the house of their God.’ (Neh. 10:39) Today, Jehovah’s “house” is his arrangement for worship. Our district conventions are part of that arrangement. Not to neglect this arrangement, we must be there in attendance and pay keen attention, showing Jehovah that we highly value his provisions. (Heb. 10:24, 25) What plans should we make now to show that we fully appreciate this sacred event?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Attend All Three Days: </span><span class="font8">Every one of us should arrange to be in attendance for all three days of the convention. Are you planning to arrive early each day and to stay through the final prayer on Sunday? If so, rich blessings will be yours. Attending a convention may not always be easy. Adjusting your secular employment may require that you take a firm stand. Transportation may not always be convenient. But do not let these factors discourage you from attending the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Consider This Excellent Example: </span><span class="font8">On their way to a district convention last year, a group of brothers in an African country where there is civil unrest met up with a military group. The brothers were asked: “Who are you, and where are you going?” They answered: “We are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and we are on our way to attend the district convention.” One of the soldiers commented: “You Jehovah’s Witnesses do not fear anything. Just go, and you will be able to hold your convention without any problem. However, be aware that you will meet many soldiers. Always walk in the middle of the road! If you see many people gathered, continue walking in the middle of the road!” They did so and arrived safely at the convention. These brothers were rewarded because they demonstrated their appreciation for sacred things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Like our brothers in Africa, we also face challenges. But undoubtedly we can imitate their faith and be resolved to attend all sessions of our district convention. If adjustments are needed, look to Jehovah for guidance, knowing that he will bless our efforts to attend the entire program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Reap the Blessings: </span><span class="font8">We long for the Word of God, knowing that through it we may grow to salvation. (1 Pet. 2:2) Our attending the district convention and listening to the program will help each of us build stronger faith in that Word and thus be better able to withstand Satan’s onslaughts. In doing so, we will show Jehovah and all onlookers that we fully appreciate sacred things and “are not the sort that shrink back ... but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”—Heb. 10:39; 12:16; Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> We can look forward to Jehovah God’s opening the floodgates of heaven and pouring out upon us copious showers of spiritual blessings. (Mal. 3:10) Make it your goal to be at the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention from the very opening of the program Friday morning to the closing prayer and “Amen!” Sunday afternoon. You will be glad you did!</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Let All Your Affairs Take Place With Love”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “Your members are a true delight; conducting themselves with the utmost courtesy and respect.” That observation came from a convention and visitors bureau in a United States city that hosted one of our district conventions. It does our hearts good to receive such commendation for how we conduct ourselves in public. This shows that as a whole we are ‘letting all our affairs take place with love.’ (1 Cor. 16:14) At the same time, there are some matters of concern that if not addressed will detract from the good reputation of God’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Problems With Rooming Reservations: </span><span class="font8">In each convention city, a Rooming Department is established to negotiate with hotels for reasonable rates so that everyone can afford to attend the convention. Our brothers expend considerable time and effort in our behalf. The managers of some hotels have at first hesitated to agree to a lower rate because of their negative experiences with other religious groups. When our Rooming Department has assured them that our delegates will cooperate with the hotel, many establishments have been happy to list rooms for us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Last year several hotels complained that they had an unusually large number of lastminute cancellations. Why was this? Some delegates had booked rooms at two hotels but failed to send in a deposit to the first one or to notify them that they were canceling their reservation in favor of another hotel. In other cases, some brothers had reserved more than one room at a hotel, thinking that they were doing a favor for others who were traveling with them. But upon arrival they accepted only one room and canceled the rest. The hotels that were involved said that this had never happened before with Watchtower delegates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> This causes serious problems for the hotels and for our convention organization. Hotels reserve a certain number of rooms for our delegates and are led to believe that they have all been filled, only to find at convention time that they have empty rooms. If the problem persists, it may become a point of contention with these hotels when negotiating for future conventions. To avoid this, reservations are to be made only for hotel rooms that will definitely be used. Additionally, one night’s deposit must be made to guarantee each room reserved. Doing so will also hold the room for late arrival. With this in mind, have you already sent your deposit to the hotel where you are booked to stay?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Some of the hotels offering a complimentary breakfast have complained that our brothers are abusing the arrangement by taking large amounts of food items with them even after they have eaten at the hotel. When a hotel provides food in the morning for its guests, it is to be regarded as what it is—a complimentary breakfast for those who are staying there. It is not intended that we take these food items with us to eat later or to share with friends at the convention. If we abuse this provision, it could result in the hotel’s canceling this service, wanting higher room rates, or refusing to negotiate with us in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Working What Is Good Toward All: </span><span class="font8">Good manners and exemplary conduct are motivated by love for Jehovah and for our neighbors. (Matt. 22:37-39; Jas. 3:13) The Bible urges us to be loving and considerate toward all people. (Gal. 6:10) That principle certainly applies when we stay at hotels. An unwillingness to cooperate taints our reputation, endangers our arrangement to get reduced rates, and creates hard feelings among brothers. If a hotel decides no longer to offer good rates, others attending the convention in that city may be seriously affected, especially if they are unable to afford a higher room rate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> When a choice room is reserved in advance and canceled at the last minute, it means that another brother was deprived of having it when he attempted to make a reservation. This may require that he travel farther or accept less desirable accommodations. Is that loving or considerate? How much better to show love and work what is good toward others by having their best interests in mind rather than our own!—Matt. 7:12; John 13:34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> We eagerly anticipate attending the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention. Have you made all your preparations, including hotel reservations and travel arrangements? May our conduct at the hotels and in the convention city always reflect the truth that is in our hearts and our love for our Creator.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Be Attentive to Sacred Pronouncements</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Not everything spoken by man deserves special attention. But when God speaks, there is vital reason to listen. (Deut. 28:1, 2) Thankfully, inspired penmen recorded “the sacred pronouncements of God” for our benefit. (Rom. 3:2) The upcoming district convention will provide precious opportunities to hear these pronouncements as they are read and discussed. How can you be especially attentive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Arrive Early Each Morning: </span><span class="font8">Imagine the excitement of the Israelites when they were told to meet Jehovah at Mount Sinai to hear his Law! (Ex. 19:10,11,16-19) If you have a similar attitude about receiving Jehovah’s instruction at the district convention, you will make arrangements to arrive early each day. We cannot listen to the entire program if we walk in late and disturb others by our efforts to find seats. Doors will open at the convention site at 8:00 a.m., and the program begins at 9:30 a.m. each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Even some who arrive early are not in their seats for the start of the session. Why is this? They wait until the chairman introduces the opening song before they stop conversing with friends and start making their way to their seats. We should take note that several minutes before the opening song of each session, the chairman will be seated on the platform while introductory Kingdom music is played. This is our signal that it is time to be seated! Then, when the opening song is called for, we will be ready to join in singing praises to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Listen as a United Family: </span><span class="font8">When sacred pronouncements were read to the congregated Israelites, families, including “little ones,” were to listen and learn. (Deut. 31:12) At our conventions, children should not be “let on the loose.” (Prov. 29:15) Parents, arrange for your entire family to sit together—teenagers included. Some parents wait until the opening song to take their young ones to the rest room. However, this would hardly teach children the great importance of songs and prayers in our worship. How much better it is to care for restroom needs </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font8"> the start of each session if at all possible!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> It will help us to listen if we get plenty of rest each night and avoid heavy meals during the day. Concentrate on what the speaker is saying. Refuse to allow your mind to wander. Follow along in the Bible when scriptures are read. Take brief notes. As each talk is being given, review in your mind what the speaker has said, and consider how you will apply the material. At the end of the day, discuss the program as a family. What points did each one enjoy? How can your family put this information to good use?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Show Respect for God’s Word: </span><span class="font8">Conventions give us a fine opportunity to talk to friends and enjoy upbuilding association. By arriving early, we will have time to converse before the program starts. Some, though, engage in conversation during the program, mistakenly thinking that this causes little distraction in a large auditorium. Even when meetings are held in a large setting, it is a time to listen, just as when attending a meeting in the Kingdom Hall. The use of cellular phones, pagers, camcorders, and cameras should not be allowed to cause distractions during the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> While Moses was receiving the Law from Jehovah, “he ate no bread and he drank no water.” (Ex. 34:28) Similarly, it would be inappropriate to eat or drink while convention sessions are in progress. Unless serious health factors are involved, wait until the “appointed time” for this.—Eccl. 3:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> At some conventions, there continues to be a problem with many brothers and sisters and even young children milling about in the corridors during the sessions. Attendants will be instructed to ask such ones to return to the auditorium. Volunteers who are working in various departments should be seated in the audience as soon as their work has been completed. Unless volunteers are assigned to do essential work during the sessions, they should be in their seats, listening to the program. They should not linger in the departments, visiting with one another while the program is in session.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> We would never want to become ‘dull in our hearing’ when listening to God’s Word. (Heb. 5:11) Let us therefore be resolved to show due respect by listening attentively as the sacred pronouncements from Jehovah are discussed at our upcoming district convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Maintain Fine Conduct That Glorifies God</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Wherever we are, our conduct, dress, and grooming bear witness about us and the God we worship. This becomes especially noticeable at large gatherings of God’s people, where many people observe us. When we are exemplary, Jehovah’s name is glorified. (1 Pet. 2: 12) However, poor behavior or thoughtless actions on the part of just a few can bring reproach on God’s name and on his people. (Eccl. 9:18b) Keeping in mind that by our conduct outsiders judge our organization and the God we worship should make us conscientious about ‘doing all things for God’s glory.’—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Exemplary Conduct at Hotels: </span><span class="font8">In most cases, hotel personnel are very impressed with the orderliness, good manners, and cleanliness of Jehovah’s Witnesses. One manager, when speaking about Witness families who stayed at his hotel, said: “The children of Jehovah’s Witnesses are the best children I’ve ever seen! They are dressed like ladies and gentlemen; they are polite, courteous, and well-mannered; and they have not caused any problem whatever. You are really to be complimented on your youngsters. We have enjoyed having your children here.” Comments like these are readily forthcoming because those dealing with us can see the love and respect that exist among Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> On the other hand, remarks by other hotel personnel indicate that there is still a problem with some who are careless in their conduct or who abuse hotel facilities. This causes problems and creates criticism that should not exist. Some managers complain that children and teenagers are noisy and unruly, being unsupervised by their parents while using the swimming pool or other recreational facilities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Most hotels have rules that guests are expected to follow. Some brothers have broken these rules in regard to noise levels or cooking in their rooms. Hotel managers tell us that cooking, where not allowed, is a common abuse of their property. Not only have rooms been physically damaged but lingering odors have also made it impossible to rent the rooms for days or weeks afterward. Unless the cooking of food is specifically permitted in the room, it must not be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> A real effort should be made to cooperate fully with the management. Certainly, we do not want to leave an unfavorable impression of Jehovah’s people. As Christians we must conduct ourselves honestly at all times. We should not take linen or other “souvenirs” from hotels, as that is stealing; nor should we be untruthful in reporting how many people we plan to have in a room when making reservations or when checking in.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Proper Decorum at the Convention: </span><span class="font8">Regardless of the type of facility used, it is to be viewed as a large Kingdom Hall during the convention. Appropriate dress and grooming should be just as evident as when we attend the meetings of our local congregation. Both during and following convention sessions, brothers and sisters should avoid wearing immodest or faddish outfits, which reflect the spirit of the world and make us hard to recognize as being wholesomely different. Sisters should be careful that the style and length of their skirts and dresses are suitably modest. (1 Tim. 2:9,10) Whether attending the convention, staying at a hotel, eating in a restaurant, or shopping in a store, we should at all times reflect that we are God’s ministers, giving no cause for stumbling.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> The baptism will be held on Saturday morning at the convention. The April 1, 1995, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> page 30, describes the attitude we should display on that occasion. It states that we “ought to treat baptism with appropriate seriousness. It is not a time for outbursts, for partying, or for hilarity. But neither is it a somber or grim time.” It would be most inappropriate for those getting baptized to wear very skimpy or revealing bathing apparel, whether men or women. Hence, all should reflect both the seriousness and the joy of Christian baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Peter reminds us of ‘what sort of persons we ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.’ (2 Pet. 3:11) May our words and actions at the “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention help honestheart-ed observers to know and worship our great God, who is worthy of all honor and glory. —1 Cor. 14:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">■ How can attendants assist parents in helping their children maintain proper decorum at meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Children are naturally energetic, unaccustomed to sitting for long periods of time. After a meeting, children have pent-up energy that may incline them to run and chase other children in the Kingdom Hall or at other meeting places, in the parking lot, or on the sidewalk. However, true is the proverb: ‘A child let on the loose will cause his parent shame.’—Prov. 29:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sad to say, some of our older brothers and sisters have been seriously injured because children ran into them and knocked them down. This has caused undue suffering as well as unnecessary expense for the parents and the congregation. For their own security and the safety of others, children should not be allowed to run and play inside or outside the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Parents have the Scriptural responsibility to train their children to treat our places of worship with proper respect. (Eccl. 5:1a) At our Christian meetings, assemblies, and conventions, attendants are assigned to see that “all things take place decently” and that there is “good order.” (1 Cor. 14:40; Col. 2:5) They must remain alert before, during, and after the program, both indoors and outdoors. If a child is running or becoming unruly, the attendant can gently stop the child, and he can explain to the child why such actions are not acceptable. The child’s parent also should kindly be told of the problem and of the need to supervise the child. The parent should respond appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is understood that at times infants and small children may cry or become disruptive during meetings. Attendants, arriving at least 20 minutes before the start of the program, can reserve the last couple of rows in the auditorium for parents who would like to sit there with their young children. The rest of us should cooperate by leaving those seats available to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a child is causing a disruption, the parent should take some action. If the parent does not and the disturbance becomes distracting, an attendant should kindly ask if the parent would like to take the child out of the auditorium. When we invite new ones with young children to the meetings, we should sit with them and offer to help with the children if they cry or disrupt in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It brings us joy to see children of all ages at the Kingdom Hall and to observe their good conduct within God’s household. (1 Tim. 3:15) By their respecting Jehovah’s arrangement for worship, they bring him honor and are appreciated by all in the congregation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Finding Joy in Your Sacred Service</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> They returned “with joy.” The Bible account expresses how the 70 disciples felt when they reported back to Jesus, following an extended preaching tour. They experienced an inner sense of delight from doing God’s will. (Luke 10:17) What can help you to find similar joy in sacred service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Positive Attitude: </span><span class="font8">You have the God-given privilege of acquainting people with Jehovah’s grand purpose. By your preaching, you may help free an individual from this world’s degrading practices and the shackles of false religion. You can offer people the hope of life in a world free of the discord that surrounds us today. Think of the joy that Jehovah has when you successfully plant the seeds of truth in a receptive heart. Be positive in praying for God’s spirit to produce in you the fruit of joy as you pursue the ministry with all your heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Practical Training: </span><span class="font8">The instruction session that Jesus conducted with the 70 disciples has been likened to a modernday Service Meeting. He provided training so that they could effectively accomplish their ministry. (Luke 10:116) Today the Service Meeting trains you in ways to approach people, how to start conversations, and how to start and conduct home Bible studies. By applying yourself and improving your preaching skills, you will find that any feelings of uneasiness or inadequacy that you may have had will diminish and be overshadowed by confidence and joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Focus on the Future: </span><span class="font8">Jesus found joy in his sacred service despite the sufferings he endured. Why? Because he kept his eye sharply focused on the blessings and privileges that lay ahead of him. (Heb. 12:2) You can do the same by keeping your mind and heart focused on Jehovah’s name and on the blessings to come in God’s new world. This will add joy and meaning to your ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Rendering sacred service to Jehovah is the greatest privilege you can have today. Therefore, may you say: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.”—Ps. 40:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“Tested as to Fitness”—How?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> With the continued growth in Jehovah’s organization, there is an ongoing need for qualified brothers to serve as ministerial servants. Most brothers not yet appointed, including teenagers, have a desire to serve in the congregation. When they are assigned extra work, they feel useful and have a sense of accomplishment. Their further advancement depends on their being “tested as to fitness.” (1 Tim. 3: 10) How is this accomplished?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Role of the Elders: </span><span class="font8">As part of measuring a brother by the Scriptural qualifications for ministerial servants found at 1 Timothy 3:8-13, the elders will test a brother’s fitness to shoulder responsibility. They may assign him to perform helpful services connected with dispensing magazines and literature, handling microphones, maintaining the Kingdom Hall, and so forth. The elders will observe how he responds to and cares for his assignments. They will look for the qualities of dependability, punctuality, diligence, modesty, a willing spirit, and an ability to get along well with others. (Phil. 2:20) Is he exemplary in his dress and grooming? Does he have a sense of responsibility? They want to see in “his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom.” (Jas. 3:13) Is he truly reaching out to be of assistance in the congregation? Is he carrying out Jesus’ command to “make disciples of people” by zealously sharing in the field ministry?—Matt. 28:19; see the September 1,1990, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font8">pages 18-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> While the Bible sets no minimum age for one to be appointed a ministerial servant, it refers to such brothers as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“men</span><span class="font8"> who minister.” We would hardly expect them to be in their early or middle teens, especially since the possibility of having a wife and children is mentioned. (1 Tim. 3:12, 13) Such men should not be yielding to “the desires incidental to youth” but should be conducting themselves in a serious manner, having a fine standing and a clean conscience before God and men—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> While natural ability is useful, one’s attitude and spirit are what really count. Does a brother humbly desire to praise God and to be of service to his brothers? If so, Jehovah will bless his efforts to make progress in the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup></sup> Many who are now parents fondly recall a privilege they enjoyed as children growing up in the truth—Magazine Day activity.

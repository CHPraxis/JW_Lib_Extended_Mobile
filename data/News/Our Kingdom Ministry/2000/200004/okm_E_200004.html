<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Reflecting on his Master’s life course, the apostle John wrote: “Jesus, having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the end.’^fjQ</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">hn 13:1</span><span class="font11">) During this Memorial season^ our thoughts turn to the greatest expression of Christ’s love.

<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Responding Fo Christ’s Love: </span><span class="font11">Jesus was very active in the final week of his earthly life. (Matt. 21:23; 23:1; 24:3) As imitators of Christ, we too are moved by love to ‘exert ourselves vigorously’ in Jehovah’s service. (Luke 13:24) Can you take advantage of the arrangements-for-added </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">witness-. </span><span class="font11">ing activity during April by increasing the time that you spend in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> This year the Lord’s Evening Meal falls on Wednesday evening, A</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">pril</span><span class="font11"> 19. How many; will be on hand for this significant occasion? To a large extent, that depends on us. Have you made a list oi those you plan to invite —your Bible students and other interested ones, relatives, business acquaintances, and schoolmates? Have you contacted them and extended a heartfelt invitation? Will you remind them a few days before the Memorial? Do they need your assistance in getting there? The elders are also inviting any who have become inactive in the ministry. The fact that the Memorial will be held on a weeknight rather than on the weekend makes it no less important for all to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Come Prepared: </span><span class="font11">It is vital for us to be prepared and to be in the proper frame of mind when we attend the Memorial. Paul exhorted fellow believers to keep in mind the seriousness of the occasion. (1 Cor. 11:20-26) You might read chapters 13 to 17 of John’s Gospel during your family Bible study and then have each family member relatejvhat Jesusisacri-fice </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">means tz/him</span><span class="font11">.^Do not forget t'o'do the daily Bible reading for the week of the Memorial as well!</span></p></li>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-Sacrifice?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Appreciation for what Jesus Christ unselfishly accomplished for mankind should move all of us to use our abilities, energies, and strengths in a selfsacrificing way. The Scriptures entreat: “Present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service.” (Rom. 12:1) Periodic self-examination will help you to see if you are showing that sort of spirit as fully as your personal circumstances allow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In the Pursuit of Bible Knowledge: </span><span class="font11">Have you set aside time for personal Bible reading and study on a regular basis? Do you hold to that schedule? Is it your routine to prepare well for congregation meetings? If you are a family head, do you have a regular Bible study with your household? Doing these things may require sacrificing time spent in front of the television or at the computer or in other pursuits. However, what a small sacrifice to make, knowing that time spent with God’s Word will help lead you to everlasting life!—John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> In the Training of Your Children: </span><span class="font11">The best time to begin learning a course of self-sacrifice is in childhood. Teach your children that while there is a time for play, there must also be a time for work and for theocratic activities. (Eph. 6:4) Give them some useful work to do around the house. Establish a regular schedule to have a share in the ministry with them. Reinforce your instruction with your own good example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> In Congregational Activities: </span><span class="font11">A congregation is enriched when everyone in it makes willing sacrifices to accomplish things for the common good. (Heb. 13: 16) Is it possible for you to spend more time in the Kingdompreaching and disciple-making work? Can you volunteer to assist the sick or the elderly, perhaps helping them with transportation to the meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Prior to making the ultimate sacrifice of his human life, Jesus counseled his disciples to focus their eyes on Kingdom interests, making everything else in life secondary. (Matt. 6:33) Pursuing such a spirit of self-sacrifice will bring us the greater happiness as we continue serving Jehovah with rejoicing.</span></p>

Only two weekends are left in April, so encourage everyone to participate in the ministry before the month ends. Demonstrate a brief magazine presentation using the current issues. Since we may be obliged to respond to people who want us to share in their Easter customs, review what is stated in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 179-80.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Song 68 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeal That Stirs Up the Majority</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The apostle Paul commended the Corinthians because their zeal for a good work had “stirred up the majority” of their fellow Christians. (2 Cor. 9:2) Often, an individual, a family, a book study group, or an entire congregation can have a similar effect by the zealous share they have in the evangelizing work. Here are some ways that you may be able to show zeal for the ministry. ■ Reserve your Saturdays for Magazine Day activity. ■ Participate in some field service on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Use longer daylight hours to share in evening witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Take part in any special witnessing days that are arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Use a holiday from work or school to go in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Support the ministry during the circuit overseer’s visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Auxiliary pioneer one or more months during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Adjust your circumstances to regular pioneer if possible.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>April—ATime to Be Zealous for Fine Works!</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As a hurricane nears a populated area, the need to warn people of the impending danger becomes urgent. The closer the hurricane comes, the more emphatic the warnings must be. Why? Because lives are at stake! Some people may not have heard previous warnings. Others may have heard but neglected to take action. The same is true of the divine warning that we have been commissioned to sound before “the storm wind” of God’s righteous anger blows away all vestiges of this wicked world. (Prov. 10:25) The eternal lives of billions of people are at stake! The warning must be sounded. We must be “zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:11-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> For decades, Jehovah’s people have been motivated to make the Memorial season a time for special zeal in the ministry. In the spring of 1939, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font12"> forerunner of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> provided this encouragement: “With spring coming on, and good weather, we should expect the hours in the field to be doubled by [congregation] publishers, and the pioneers’ time materially increased. April is a five-Sunday month. It has also five Saturdays. Make every Saturday and Sunday during April... a time of special witnessing.” That was an ambitious goal set for the brothers 60 years ago! This year, just as in 1939, the month of April has five full weekends. What are your plans this month? What notations have you made on your calendar for April 2000? Plan to have a meaningful share in fine works with the rest of Jehovah’s people during this special month of accelerated spiritual activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What We Hope to Accomplish: </span><span class="font12">The most important day of the year 2000 falls in this month. It is April 19, the anniversary of Jesus’ death. Let us make a special effort to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">invite as many people as possible to the Memorial.</span><span class="font12"> As was suggested last month, make a list of all potential Memorial attenders and check that none are overlooked. Those invited should include any inactive publishers, Bible students, return visits, those who previously studied, work associates, schoolmates, neighbors, relatives, and other acquaintances. Do those who want to attend have transportation? If not, can you lovingly assist? On the night of the Memorial, all of us will have the privilege of making those who attend feel welcome. After the Memorial, we can follow up with additional spiritual assistance for such interested ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Being “zealous for fine works” during the days before and after the Memorial is a fine way to show Jehovah that we truly appreciate all that he has done for us. Longer daylight hours and better weather in most areas will enable many of us to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">increase our efforts in the evangelizing activity.</span><span class="font12"> If you are auxiliary pioneering, you will want to do your best to spend 50 hours or more in the ministry. (Matt. 5:37) Stick closely to the schedule you worked out at the start of the month. (Eccl. 3:1; 1 Cor. 14:40) May the rest of us do what we can to extend a supportive hand to all the pioneers, both by encouraging them and by working with them in the field. (Compare 2 Kings 10:15,16.) If we zealously sow during April, we can expect great joy and a blessing from Jehovah. (Mal. 3:10) Perhaps this will serve as a stepping-stone to continuous auxiliary pioneering or to regular pioneering. May the spiritual momentum that we gain in April carry over into succeeding months as we continue to be regular Kingdom publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Undoubtedly, thousands of Jehovah’s people this month will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">start more home Bible studies.</span><span class="font12"> Would you like to start one? Pray specifically for a study, and work in harmony with your prayers. You can be sure that Jehovah will appreciate your humble requests for help in finding an honesthearted person to teach.—1 John 3:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Here is a field-tested approach that has been successfully used to start conversations. You begin by asking: “Do you think that all the violence in public schools is the result of demonic activity, or does it come from a lack of parental training?” Allow for a response. If the person says “demonic activity,” read Revelation 12:9, 12, and highlight the Devil’s role in promoting turmoil in the world. Then open the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure to lesson 4, and ask if the person ever wondered where the Devil came from. Proceed to read and discuss the first two paragraphs. If the person chooses “a lack of parental training” as the reason for violence in the schools, read </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font12"> Timothy 3:1-3 and point out the traits that evidently contribute to this problem. Then open the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure to lesson 8, read paragraph 5, and continue the discussion. If you can make an appointment to return, you may be well on your way to having a regular Bible study with the person. During a subsequent visit, ask him if he knows anyone else who might be interested in hearing what he is learning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Another way to be “zealous for fine works” during April is to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">share in various avenues of preaching.</span><span class="font12"> Have you been thinking about witnessing in a park or a parking lot? At a bus stop or a train station? Or would you like to try witnessing by telephone, on the street, or in business territory? Why not turn those thoughts into reality this month? Jehovah will help you muster up the necessary boldness. (Acts 4:31; 1 Thess. 2:2b) Perhaps you can make an appointment to work with a pioneer or a publisher who is experienced in these facets of the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Anyone desirous of increasing his share in the witness work will want to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">participate in informal witnessing.</span><span class="font12"> Often all it takes is engaging a person in a friendly conversation. Simply raise a subject of common interest, perhaps using the approach highlighted in paragraph 6. Strive to make good use of even small increments of time that otherwise would be lost. We do not discard nickels, dimes, or quarters just because they are not full dollars. Why not profitably use even five minutes, ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour witnessing informally?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> A Time for Reflection: </span><span class="font12">Think back to the powerful points that were made in the drama at the “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention last year. The drama, entitled </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Appreciating Our Spiritual Heritage,</span><span class="font12"> made us think carefully about the contrast between Jacob and Esau. Esau </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">said</span><span class="font12"> that like Jacob, he had interest in spiritual things, but Esau’s works did not show it. (Gen. 25:29-34) What a powerful warning for us! Like Jacob, let us be ready to struggle, even wrestle, for Jehovah’s blessing. (Gen. 32:24-29) Why not use April and all ensuing months to renew our zeal, never taking our wonderful spiritual heritage for granted?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> “The great day of Jehovah is near. It is near, and there is a hurrying of it very much.” (Zeph. 1:14) The Kingdom good news must be sounded forth. Lives are at stake! May this month prove to be especially blessed for all of Jehovah’s people as we unitedly show that we are “zealous for fine works.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">The Memorial observance this year falls on Wednesday, April 19. The elders should give attention to the following matters:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location of the observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.—See the February 15,1985, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> page 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Plates, glasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The Kingdom Hall or other place of meeting should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties and the proper procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ When more than one congregation is scheduled to use the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination among congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby or entryway, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">■ Who should receive a district convention lapel badge card?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Convention lapel badge cards can be very helpful in identifying our brothers and in advertising the convention. However, they should not be distributed indiscriminately. They identify the wearer as being in good standing with a particular congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The card has space for the name of the individual as well as the name of the congregation. Therefore, the person would have to be associated to a reasonable extent with the named congregation. The Society sends a supply of cards to each congregation. It would be appropriate to give a card to each baptized and unbaptized publisher. Also, children and others who regularly attend congregation meetings and who are making progress toward sharing in the held ministry may receive one. It would not be proper to give a convention lapel badge card to a disfel-lowshipped person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the cards are made available, the elders should see that they are distributed in harmony with these guidelines.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Are You a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Regular</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Kingdom Proclaimer?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We all rejoiced upon learning that the United States reached an all-time peak of 1,040,283 publishers in August 1998. Truly a united and determined effort! Evidently in the months that followed, some of these publishers have had difficulty being </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font11"> Kingdom proclaimers, for the monthly average ever since has been about 940,000. This indicates that 1 publisher in 12 has not reported sharing in the ministry </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font11"> month. We believe that the following encouragement can help to remedy the situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Appreciate the Privilege: </span><span class="font11">Our appreciation should run deep for the privilege we have to share the Kingdom good news with others. This activity makes Jehovah’s heart glad and helps honesthearted ones to learn the way to life. (Prov. 27:11; 1 Tim. 4: 16) Witnessing regularly builds up our experience in the ministry and results in a feeling of joy and accomplishment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Report the Activity: </span><span class="font11">Some who share in field service neglect to report their activity on time. Never should we feel that our effort was not worth reporting. (Compare Mark 12:4144.) By all means, we should report what we have done! Having a system at home, such as using a calendar, for recording time spent in the ministry will serve as a constant reminder to make an accurate report promptly at the end of each month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Give the Help Needed: </span><span class="font11">Local arrangements may have to be improved for assisting those who need help in having a consistent share in the ministry. The congregation secretary and book study conductors should arrange for experienced publishers to lend a helping hand. If you have children or other Bible students who are unbaptized publishers, train them to report their activity every month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Recall the life story, “Grateful for a Long Life in Jehovah’s Service,” in the October 1, 1997, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Sister Ottilie Myd-land of Norway became a regular publisher of the good news prior to her baptism in 1921. Seventy-six years later, at age 99, she said: “I am glad that it is still possible for me to be a regular publisher.” What a marvelous attitude for all of Jehovah’s servants to imitate!</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Make Sure That You Go Back!</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “What a good conversation! I’ll have to remember to make a return visit there. ” Have you ever said those words and later forgotten where the person lives? If so, you know that the only way you can make sure that you go back is to put it in writing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Write It All Down: </span><span class="font11">While a conversation with an interested person is still fresh in your mind, take a moment to write down all the pertinent information about the call. Note the person’s name and how you will recognize him. Put down his address, but do not guess at it —check to be sure that what you write is correct. Note the subject you talked about, any scriptures that you read, and what literature was placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If you left the person with a question to be answered on the next call, write it down. Did you learn something about the person, his family, or his religion? If so, make a notation of this. Then the next time you call, your making mention of it will demonstrate your personal interest in the individual. Finally, include the day and time that you made the initial call and when you said you would return. By making good notes, you will have clear reminders and will be less likely to forget your promise to return. —1 Tim. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Once your record is complete, put it with the rest of your field service equipment—book bag, Bible, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book, and literature—so that it will always be handy. It is best to record not-at-homes on house-to-house records that are separate from those that you use to make note of your return visits. Of course, regardless of the work you put into keeping track of return visits, the important thing is to make sure that you go back!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Think About the Person: </span><span class="font11">When preparing for the ministry, review your return visit notes. Give thought to each individual and what approach might best be used when making the next call. Think of how to develop the person’s interest into a home Bible study. Such planning can increase your productivity as a minister of the good news and, hence, your personal joy.—Prov. 21:5a.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> So the next time you find a listening ear, do not reason that you can easily remember the call. Instead, write it down, review your notes, keep thinking about the person, and then make sure that you go back!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">July 2000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 7/00 Vol. 43, No. 7</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“We Cannot Stop Speaking”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ is closely monitoring the preaching work. (Matt. 28:20; Mark 13: 10) Though there are nearly six million active proclaimers bearing witness in 234 lands, we must not presume that our witnessing is finished. Until God declares that the work is done, “we cannot stop speaking” about the things we have learned.—Acts 4:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Rely on God’s Spirit: </span><span class="font10">Satan applies great pressure to discourage us. (Rev. 12:17) Our own imperfect flesh also plagues us with many problems. Such things can divert our attention from the all-important preaching work. Nevertheless, if we trust in Jehovah, his spirit will help us face any obstacle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When the first-century Christian congregation was severely persecuted, the brothers prayed to God for help to keep speaking his word with all boldness. Jehovah answered their prayer, infusing them with his spirit and giving them the zeal and determination needed to keep on preaching. As a result, they continued without letup boldly declaring the good news.—Acts 4:29, 31; 5:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Do Not Fear Negative Talk: </span><span class="font10">General opinion or slanderous publicity may tend to have an intimidating effect upon us. However, remember the bold statement of Peter and the other apostles to the Sanhedrin, recorded at Acts 5:29-32. As the Law teacher Gamaliel admitted, God’s work cannot be overthrown. It is not accomplished by our power. This great work has God’s backing, and only he can accomplish it!—Zech. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Let us daily beseech Jehovah for his spirit to help us zealously proclaim the good news. May we say, as Jeremiah did, that the Kingdom message is like a burning fire in our bones. (Jer. 20:9) We cannot be silent!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let All Things Take Place for Upbuilding”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In dealing with our brothers, we should do what is good for their upbuilding. This means being concerned about protecting their spiritual interests. If we engage in some type of secular work that involves promoting a product or service, we need to be careful that nothing we do will stumble our brothers. —2 Cor. 6:3; Phil. 1:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some have become involved in various business ventures, targeting fellow Christians as potential customers. Certain sales organizations encourage their representatives to view everyone as a potential customer—including those who belong to the same religion as they do. Some brothers have organized large gatherings of Witnesses for the purpose of encouraging them to become involved in a business enterprise. Others promote their venture by directing unsolicited articles, brochures, information on the Internet, or tapes to fellow believers. Would it be proper for a Christian to use his theocratic contacts to take advantage of his spiritual brothers? No!—1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 31-33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Brothers Should Beware: </span><span class="font10">This does not mean that a Christian cannot do business with a brother. That is a personal matter. However, some initiate business schemes that encourage greed, and they prompt fellow believers to become their partners or investors. Many of these ventures fail, costing participants huge sums of money. Although those who joined in the enterprise may have been motivated by a desire to make quick money, the organizer should not feel that he is free from blame if the undertaking fails. He should carefully consider in advance how the spiritual and physical well-being of his brothers would be affected in the event that the venture does not succeed. Those holding positions of theocratic responsibility should be especially cautious about their secular endeavors because others may look to them with respect and place considerable trust in them. It would be wrong to abuse that trust. Privileges of sacred service may be forfeited if a brother loses the respect of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Our goal should be to “let all things take place for upbuilding.” (1 Cor. 14:26) We must avoid doing anything that introduces commercial activities into the congregation or promotes them. Such things have nothing to do with our Scriptural reasons for assembling together.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

He has recently observed that their conversations often dwell on sports heroes, movie stars, TV personalities, and musicians. He expresses concern because this type of fascination is a manifestation of the spirit of the world. They discuss the May 22, 1998, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> pages 12-14. The youths realize that there is danger in idolizing worldly figures and agree that worldly prominence has nothing to offer Christians.

They agree that they want to do all they can to help the congregation appreciate the urgency of the times and grow and prosper spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font9">Writing Letters to People Whom We Are Unable to Contact. Talk and audience discussion. As it is increasingly difficult to find people at home, some publishers get good results by writing letters. Consider these guidelines. Letters should be brief, Scripturally based, and respectful. Do not send anonymous letters. Write or type neatly and legibly.

<p><span class="font1">The insert in the March issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font1"> posed the question “Can We Make April 2000 Our Best Month Ever?’ We are happy to report that in April we had a new peak of 153,774 auxiliary pioneers! The combined total of regular and auxiliary pioneers was 247,784. This exceeded the previous peak set in March 1997 by 32,795. The increased activity resulted in new peaks of 21,144,343 hours, 16,687,638 magazines, and 6,509,747 return visits!

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">We know that Jehovah God is worthy of our love and our exclusive devotion. However, the world seeks to entice us away from maintaining our close relationship with him. (John 17:14) To reinforce our love for Jehovah and to strengthen us to resist the things of the world that endanger our spirituality, the new circuit assembly program for the 2001 service year will have as its theme “Love God —Not the Things of the World.” —1 John 2:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Deep love for Jehovah impels us to give a witness about him. Even so, the field service is not easy for many of God’s people. In the part “Love for God Motivates Us in Our Ministry,” learn how many have overcome shyness and other obstacles in order to share fully in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How do the deteriorating standards of the world influence us? Actions once considered wicked are now so-called normal behavior. The talk “Lovers of Jehovah Hate What Is Bad” and the symposium “Things in the World —How Do We View Them?” will bolster our determination to say no to wrong desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A model Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting will be included in the program, as well as a summary of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study article for the week. The public address, “How Love and Faith Conquer the World,” will encourage us to imitate Jesus in resisting worldly pressures. (John 16:33) Be sure to invite your Bible students to attend. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements can be made.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Are You a Shy Person?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We are not surprised when we see a young child peeking at us from behind his mother or father. Shyness is natural in early childhood. Even in adulthood, many are somewhat shy by nature. If shyness affects your participation in the ministry, what can you do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Coping With Shyness: </span><span class="font10">It is important to give attention to “the secret person of the heart.” (1 Pet. 3:4) Strengthen your love for Jehovah and for your neighbor. Be thoroughly convinced that fulfilling the preaching commission is one of the best ways to demonstrate self-sacrificing love. Pursue a good routine of personal study and meeting attendance. Pray regularly and specifically for Jehovah’s help. Strong faith and trust in him will build confidence and give “all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.”—Phil. 1:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Fight feelings of inadequacy. It appears that Timothy had to do this. Paul encouraged Timothy to “let no man ever look down on [his] youth,” reminding him that “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power.” (1 Tim. 4: 12; 2 Tim. 1:7) Timothy was used fully by Jehovah, who will also use you if you move forward with complete confidence in Him.—Ps. 56:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Reflecting on a Bible text, such as Matthew 10:37, helped a sister whose timidity made her fearful of her opposed husband. As she persevered, the ministry became easier for her, and eventually her husband, mother, and brothers all accepted the truth!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>s</sup> Preparation Is Essential: </span><span class="font10">Your confidence will further increase when you prepare thoroughly for the ministry. Select a simple presentation from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book or past issues of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> get it well in mind, and rehearse it. Rather than building up unnecessary anxiety, think positively. Draw courage from working closely with others. Keep in mind that many of the people you will meet at the doors are timid, just like you. Everyone needs the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you are shy, do not despair. As you apply yourself, Jehovah will help you to be an effective preacher of the good news. Then you will have joy in your ministry.—Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Do You Appreciate Jehovah’s Patience?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> If Jehovah had not been patient for the past 10, 20, and more years, allowing an extended witness to be given, would you have learned the truth? How grateful we are that he has allowed many more people “to attain to repentance.” Yet, Jehovah’s great day of judgment “will come as a thief.” (2 Pet. 3:9, 10) Hence, the patience of God should not be misinterpreted as a delay in bringing the end to this system of things—Hab. 2:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Feel Pity for People: </span><span class="font10">Jehovah’s long-suffering far exceeds our comprehension. We must not lose sight of its purpose. (Jonah 4:1-4, 11) Jehovah sees the pitiable condition of mankind and has compassion for them. Jesus feels the same way. Having pity for the crowds to whom he preached, he wanted the evangelizing work to expand so that more would have the opportunity of gaining everlasting life.—Matt. 9:35-38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> When tragedies and disasters strike, do not our hearts go out to people who do not know the truth? People today are like “sheep without a shepherd” as they try to cope with and make sense of the chaos in the world. (Mark 6:34) By zealously preaching the good news, we comfort those of rightly disposed heart and demonstrate our appreciation for Jehovah’s patience.—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Our Work Is Urgent: </span><span class="font10">Last year 323,439 were baptized and over 14,000,000 attended the Memorial. What potential there is for many more to escape the destruction of this wicked system! How large the “great crowd” will be, we do not know. (Rev. 7:9) How long our commission to preach will last, we do not know. But Jehovah knows. The good news will be preached to his satisfaction, “and then the end will come.” —Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The time left is reduced, and God’s day is imminent. (1 Cor. 7:29a; Heb. 10:37) Without a doubt, “our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.” (Rom. 13: 11) Let us not miss the purpose of divine patience. Instead, let us urgently preach so that more who yearn for righteousness may experience Jehovah’s great mercy.</span></p></li></ul>

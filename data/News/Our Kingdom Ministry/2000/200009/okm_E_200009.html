<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Blessing Makes Us Rich</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">‘A person’s success is often measured by the size of his paycheck. That is why many people view those with money as being the happiest and most fulfilled. However, people who feel that money can buy happiness are sadly mistaken. (Eccl. 5: 12) There is no lasting joy for those “determined to be rich” in a material way. (1 Tim. 6:9) In contrast, Jehovah’s servants are truly joyful and are the richest people in the world. (Pfov. 10:22; Rev. 2:9) How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Evidence of Our Riches: </span><span class="font8">We possess rich spiritual insight and an understanding of God’s Word, the Bible. Through his earthly organization, Jehovah continually teaches us about himself and his Son, to our lasting benefit. Accurate understanding makes it possible for us to draw close to Jehovah and enjoy an intimate relationship with him. (Jas. 4:8) Discerning good from bad and following God’s laws shields us from certain diseases and dangers. We have confidence that Jehovah will provide for us, resulting in godly contentment and peace of mind—Matt, 6:33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> We enjoy peace and unity within our spiritual brotherhood because we cultivate the fruitage of God’s spirit. United by a strong bond of love, we need never feel abandoned by God or by our brothers when we face calamity.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Our lives have real meaning and purpose. We count it a marvelous privilege to share in the global preaching of the good news. This brings lasting joy as we help others to come into a good relationship with God and serve unitedly with us in pure worship. Our priceless treasure of the ministry brings honor to Jehovah and gives us the satisfaction of contributing toward the sanctification of his name. We maintain a positive mental attitude, knowing that our hope for the future will soon be realized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Showing Our Appreciation: </span><span class="font8">May we be ever appreciative of Jehovah’s blessings, which make us truly the richest people on earth. (Prov. 22:4) Taking time each day to meditate on what we have moves us to thank Jehovah for his generous love and to continue giving him our exclusive devotion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">■ Why is it beneficial for the audience to look up scriptures when invited to do so by a speaker during his discourse?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Factors such as the subject being discussed and whether the talk includes a verse-by-verse consideration of a portion of God’s Word will determine the number of scriptures the audience may be invited to look up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is important to keep in mind that one reason for looking up scriptures is to confirm that what is being said is from the Bible. (Acts 17:11) Another objective is to examine the Scriptural evidence in support of what is being discussed so that the faith of all is strengthened. Seeing what the Bible actually says while a key text is read will make a double impression on the mind. In addition to looking up scriptures, taking notes and keeping up with the flow of ideas being expressed is beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the Society’s outline may cite a generous number of Scriptural texts in developing a subject, these are provided for the benefit of the speaker, to help him with his preparation. These may give background information and otherwise help him to get the underlying Scriptural principles well in mind and to understand the development of the subject. The speaker determines which texts are vital to the development of the talk and invites the audience to follow along with him as such texts are read and explained. Other texts that lend support to the material may be mentioned and paraphrased, but in such cases the audience does not necessarily have to look them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the speaker reads selected scriptures, he does so directly from the Bible, not from a computer-generated printout. When the speaker invites the audience to read along, he clearly states the Bible book, the chapter, and the verse(s). By pausing to raise a question or to comment briefly on why the text is to be read, he allows time for the audience to find the scripture. Repeating the citation will also help the audience remember the reference. It is not recommended, however, to mention a page number, since these vary depending on the particular Bible edition that individuals in the audience are using. Looking up scriptures when invited to do so helps the audience benefit from the power of God’s Word as it is explained during the discourse. —Heb. 4:12.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Use Current Events to Stir Interest</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Would you like to have a continuous supply of good ideas that will keep your ministry fresh and stir people’s interest in the Bible’s message? Then use what is happening on the world scene and in your community to start conversations. You could draw on current local and national events or international news items. These things are everchanging. (1 Cor. 7:31) Consider the following examples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Economic problems and the cost of living are real concerns of people. Thus, you might say: </span><span class="font8">■ “Did you hear on the news that [mention item] prices are rising again?” Or you might comment about unemployment if a large firm has laid off many workers. Depending on how you want to proceed with the discussion, you can follow up by asking either “Have you ever wondered why it is so hard to make a living?” or “Do you think that it will always be hard to make ends meet?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Reports of violence, such as tragedies in families or among school students, provide a basis for another discussion. You could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Did you read in the newspaper that [name tragedy in the community]?” Then ask either “What do you think is the cause for so much violence in the world?” or “Do you think a time will ever come when we can feel secure?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> News of devastating floods, earthquakes, or civil unrest in different parts of the world also offers material that stirs interest. For example, you might ask: </span><span class="font8">■ “Is God responsible for [name natural disaster]?” Or you could point to the latest outbreak of civil unrest and say: “If everybody wants peace, why is it so hard to achieve?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Remain alert to current events that you can use in your introduction. Helpful suggestions are found under “Current Events,” on pages 10-11, in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book. However, avoid taking sides on political or social issues. Instead, direct attention to the Scriptures and God’s Kingdom as the only permanent solution to mankind’s problems.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Should I Move?”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> In response to Jesus’ command to “go . . . make disciples of people of all the nations,” many dedicated servants of Jehovah have moved to serve where the need is greater. (Matt. 28:19) They are imitating Paul, who responded to the call: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” (Acts 16:9) How can this be done in a practical way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Proceed One Step at a Time: </span><span class="font8">Is there seldom-worked territory within your congregation? If so, you might concentrate your efforts on those areas. Before deciding to go elsewhere, consult with your elders to see if they feel that you are equipped to make a move. You might also ask your circuit overseer if he knows of a nearby congregation where you could expand your ministry. On the other hand, after carefully counting the cost, you may wish to consider helping in another part of the country or in a different land. If this is your desire, you </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">along with your body of elders</span><span class="font8"> should write to the branch office where you are interested in serving, outlining your theocratic background. It may be wise to visit the area before deciding whether or not to make a permanent move.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be Cautious About Immigrating: </span><span class="font8">An increasing number of our brothers are moving to other lands because they are seeking either a better standard of living or relief from oppression. In the process, some have fallen prey to unscrupulous individuals who promise to help them get settled in the new land but who only take their money and then abandon them. In some cases these individuals even try to force the immigrants into immoral servitude. When they refuse, they are left at the mercy of the country they have entered. Thus the situation of the immigrants has become worse than it was in their homeland. They may even need to ask the brothers to house and otherwise assist them, putting a burden on other Christian families who are contending with their own problems and difficulties. Members of some households have been physically separated from one another, and families have been spiritually weakened by such ill-advised moves.—1 Tim. 6:8-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> If you want to make a move for personal advantage, keep in mind that no matter where you live, there are problems to be faced. It is easier to overcome problems where you already know the language and the culture, rather than starting anew in unfamiliar surroundings.</span></p></li></ul>

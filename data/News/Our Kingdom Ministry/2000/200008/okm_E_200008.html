<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">August 2000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 8/00 Vol. 43, No. 8</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">'The apostle Paul admonished Timothy to “fight the fine fight of the faith.” (1 Tim. 6: 12) Paul himself lived up to those words. Late in his life, he spoke with assurance that he had personally fought a good fight. (2 Tim. 4:6-8) In every way, he pursued the ministry with boldness, courage, and endurance. By imitating his example, we can have the same inner assurance that we are doing the best we can in our fight for the Christian faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Expend the Effort Needed: </span><span class="font1">Paul worked hard in the ministry. (1 Cor. 15:10) So do we as we search to find all the deserving ones in our territory. (Matt. 10: 11) To reach some of them, it may mean getting up early to witness to those we meet on the street. Or it may mean working in the late afternoon or early evening to meet people after they return to their homes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> It takes self-discipline and good scheduling to be punctual when meeting with our book study group for field service. For example, some of the members of the Bethel family travel up to 60 minutes each way to share in the ministry with their assigned congregations on weekends. Also, we may admire some publishers and families in our congregation who travel quite a distance but are on time. Such examples of diligence and personal organization are worthy of imitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> We should be motivated to follow up on all the interest we find. Even when placing literature on the street or in informal settings, we need to make an effort to obtain the individual’s address or telephone number. Then we can call on him to develop the interest and endeavor to start a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Be Regular in the Service: </span><span class="font1">Paul was consistent and thorough in preaching. (Rom. 15:19) What about you? Do you have a regular share in the ministry? Have you participated in the field service yet this month? Congregation Book Study conductors are interested in seeing that everyone in their group shares in the ministry during August. They will help you to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> By imitating Paul’s example in fully supporting the good news, we will continue to “fight the fine fight of the faith.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Are You Enduring?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> “No greater cause for thankfulness do I have than these things, . . . that my children go on walking in the truth.” (3 John 4) The endurance of John’s spiritual children brought him great joy. How it must delight our heavenly Father to see millions of his prospective children “go on walking in the truth”!—Prov. 23:15, 16; 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> While God’s people as a whole are persisting in zealous Christian activity, some have gradually slowed down. Though these may have been energetic when they first learned the truth, with the passing of years, they have settled into a pattern of having only a small or infrequent share in the disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Understandably, some may have slowed down because of physical limitations and the effects of advancing age. However, they are to be commended for their endurance. They are doing what they can. But each one who has dedicated his life to God should ask himself: ‘Have I allowed myself to focus so much on personal pursuits that Kingdom interests occupy only a small place in my life? Have I become somewhat “lukewarm,” or am I still exerting myself “vigorously”?’ (Rev. 3:15, 16; Luke 13: 24) May all of us prayerfully reflect on what we are doing and make improvement as needed, bearing in mind that Jehovah promises to provide “glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good.” —Rom. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How to Endure: </span><span class="font1">What helped Jesus to endure? Paul explained: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Heb. 12:1-3) The joy that was set before Jesus far outweighed the temporary trials that he had to face. Keeping in mind the joy that is set before us can help us to endure also. (Rev. 21:4, 7; 22:12) If we look to Jehovah to give us strength through personal study, regular meeting attendance, and persistent prayer, we will be able to persevere in the work he has given us to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah rejoices in the endurance of his loyal ones. So let us increase his joy by continually “walking in the truth.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting August 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 114</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Local announcements. Selected Announcements from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Comment on May field service report for the country and the local congregation. Only two weekends are left in August, so encourage everyone to participate in the ministry before the month ends. Review the weekend schedule of meetings for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">“Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith.” Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion. Draw added comments from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 44-5, on how Congregation Book Study conductors organize field service activity for their groups and give attention to any who need personal help to share in and report their ministry regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font13">How You Can Benefit by Going to School. A father talks to his children to help them appreciate why a secular education is beneficial. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 133-9.) Many youths feel that going to school is a real challenge in today’s unruly society. They also feel bored, concluding that what they learn will be of little practical value. Father reviews Scriptural principles and sound reasons why it is wise to acquire an adequate amount of secular education. He encourages his children to study well and pay attention in class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 127 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting August 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Study conductors should check with everyone in their group so that all reports can be tallied by September 6. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font13">“Meetings Benefit Young People.” Question-and-answer discussion conducted by an elder. When discussing paragraph 8, consider some practical things that promote better concentration and attentiveness during meetings. (See September 22, 1998, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> pages 19-20.) Encourage parents to be firm in having their children regularly attend all the meetings.—See experience in the September 1, 1997, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font13">page 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 176 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting September 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 196</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Local announcements. Question Box. Have publishers relate the experiences they had when witnessing informally on the way to, during, or returning from the district convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1O min: </span><span class="font13">Our Time Is Special. A talk by an elder, based on November 15, 1996, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> pages 22-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font13">“Are You Enduring?” Talk and audience discussion.

Include comments from October 1, 1999, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> pages 20-1, paragraphs 17-21. Invite two or three publishers who have endured faithfully over a period of years to relate what they are doing to persevere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 206 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Should the congregation have a master territory map displayed in the Kingdom Hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, a master territory map should be mounted in a frame and displayed on a wall in the Kingdom Hall. The map should not be placed on the information board. It should show the overall boundaries of the congregation’s assigned territory and the boundaries of each individual territory with its assigned number. The territory boundaries of all the congregations using the same Kingdom Hall should be indicated. This will help publishers and newly interested ones alike to determine in which congregation’s territory they live. Showing Congregation Book Study locations on the map will also help all in locating the book study to which they are assigned. The map should be kept up-to-date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Displaying such a map serves as a reminder to all publishers that, if possible, it would be good to have a personal territory assignment. The map is helpful to those who want to select a territory near their home. It may at times be a time-saver at meetings for service, enabling the conductor to direct each group of publishers quickly to the area where they are assigned to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The map also gives evidence that the congregation is organized to preach the Kingdom message thoroughly in its assigned territory—Luke 9:6.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Are You Benefiting Yourself?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Millions of people today want to know how to overcome problems and enjoy happy lives. They devour self-help books or look to groups and organizations for advice on how to better their lives. Perhaps some can point to limited benefits they have gained. Yet, judging by the quality of life today, have people in general learned to enjoy peaceful, deeply satisfying lives through human programs of instruction? Hardly can that be said!—1 Cor. 3:18-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> On the other hand, our Creator provides free of charge the most helpful instruction to all who will listen. Jehovah wants everyone to benefit from his teaching. He has generously provided his inspired Word to guide mankind in uprightness, and he has caused the good news of his Kingdom to be declared in all the earth. (Ps. 19:7, 8; Matt. 24:14; 2 Tim. 3:16) A truly happy life is directly related to paying attention to Jehovah’s commandments.—Isa. 48:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah’s guidance is far superior to that provided by any self-help books or selfimprovement schemes offered by the world. We can obtain genuine help and lasting benefits if we take full advantage of Jehovah’s provisions as outlined in his Word and taught by his organization.—1 Pet. 3:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Benefit Yourself at Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font1">Today, Jehovah shows genuine interest in teaching us his ways, and we benefit by paying attention to his instruction. Our five weekly meetings give evidence of Jehovah’s loving concern. When we attend congregation meetings, our knowledge of God increases. We learn how to protect ourselves from what is bad by drawing close to Jehovah. In this way our spirits are uplifted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> There is more. At congregation meetings we are able to “widen out.” (2 Cor. 6: 13) This involves getting to know others in the congregation. We benefit from an interchange of encouragement, such as the apostle Paul wrote about in his letter to the Romans. (Rom. 1:11, 12) When writing to the Hebrews, he strongly admonished those who may have been developing the custom of forsaking Christian fellowship.—Heb. 10:24,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Joyful satisfaction in living is directly related to being interested in the welfare of others. We are encouraged to seek ways to contribute to the happiness of others. Our Christian meetings, therefore, certainly are for our personal benefit and for the benefit of those with whom we cultivate wholesome fellowship. What is required of us is our heartfelt participation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> The apostle Paul made a similar point in his counsel to Timothy when he wrote: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim.” (1 Tim. 4:7) We can ask ourselves: ‘Am I training myself? Am I learning to benefit from what I am hearing at the congregation meetings?’ Our answers will be yes if we pay attention to what we hear at the meetings and endeavor to apply what we learn. With eyes of faith, we must be able to look beyond the brothers who are doing the teaching and see Jehovah as the Grand Instructor of his people.—Isa. 30:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting: </span><span class="font1">These two meetings are designed to help us be effective in the Christian ministry. The Theocratic Ministry School is just that —a school with students who receive instruction and counsel on a regular basis. You have the opportunity to demonstrate your advancement as a public speaker and as a teacher of God’s Word. But to gain the most from the school, you have to enroll, attend, participate regularly, and put your heart into your assignments. Accepting and applying counsel that is given will help you make advancement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> The Service Meeting teaches us the importance of the Christian ministry and shows us how we can share in the work of making disciples. Are you and your family benefiting fully from what is presented at these two meetings? A Christian couple observes; “At one Service Meeting, we heard that we should consider the daily text as a family. We were not doing this, but now we are.” How have they benefited themselves?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">They admit: “We find that our conversations around the meal table are more enjoyable. There is no more arguing at dinnertime.” Do even little children benefit from the meetings? Yes. The mother says: “It is obvious that our children are deeply affected by the meetings. One particular week we caught our six-year-old son telling some lies. But that week at the meeting, the instruction talk was about lying. With the guiltiest expression on his face, our son looked at his father and scrunched down in his seat. He got the point, and we had no problems after that.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> A pioneer sister says she is glad that suggestions to improve our ministry are given at the Service Meeting. Why? She explains: “I get into a rut. Sometimes I think that what is suggested in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">OurKingdomMinistry</span><span class="font1"> will not work. But at the Service Meeting, when I hear that we should try it, I get fired with enthusiasm to apply the suggestions. It makes the ministry exciting!” After several weeks of applying the suggestion to try to start a Bible study on the initial call, she started a study on the first call with a girl who had been praying for help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> When you hear a talk that includes Bible counsel on personal choices you make, do you sense that Jehovah is speaking directly to you? A brother felt that way. He said: “Recently at one meeting, there was a talk in which a brother discussed what forms of entertainment were proper for Christians and what forms were improper. I used to like to watch boxing on television. But after that meeting, I decided that this sport fell into the category of entertainment that would not be proper for Christians. So I don’t watch it anymore.” Yes, though this brother had developed a fondness for something that is violent, he humbly responded to Jehovah’s leading. —Ps. 11:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> The Public Meeting, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Study, and the Congregation Book Study: </span><span class="font1">The public talks we hear each week cover a variety of Bible subjects. What are you deriving from these talks? One Christian husband commented on the benefits he had received: “One public talk highlighted all the fruits of the spirit. The speaker mentioned, with regard to himself, that in order to work on cultivating these fruits, he would choose one particular quality and work on that for a week. At the end of the week, he reflected on how he did in displaying that fruit in his everyday activities. Then he worked on another quality for the next week. I liked the idea and began to do that myself.” What a fine application of what was learned!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>13</sup> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Study teaches us to apply Bible principles in various situations of life. This helps us to maintain calm minds and hearts despite life’s anxieties. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Study also keeps us up-to-date with progressive truth. For example, did we not benefit from the study of the May 1, 1999, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> articles entitled: “These Things Must Take Place,” “Let the Reader Use Discernment,” and “Be Vigilant and Be Diligent!” How did these studies affect you personally? Do you show by your actions that you take to heart Jesus’ warning about the future? Are you preparing yourself for the tests ahead when we see “the disgusting thing that causes desolation ... standing in a holy place”? (Matt. 24:15-22) Do your goals and life course manifest that, not the accumulating of material goods, but the sanctifying of Jehovah’s name is the most important thing to you? At the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Study, are we not learning to benefit ourselves now?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>14</sup> Think of how much we learn at the Congregation Book Study each week. Currently we are studying the Bible book of Daniel. In the four months that we have been studying that Bible book, have we not seen our faith grow each week? Like Jehovah’s beloved <sub>i </sub>prophet Daniel, we strengthen our faith so that we might endure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Jehovah Teaches Us to Live Joyfully: </span><span class="font1">We avoid much heartache when we pay attention to God’s commands. Moreover, we experience what joyful living is all about. Following Jehovah’s lead, we become participants in his work, not just observers.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">“Become Full-Grown in Powers of Understanding” is the theme of the special assembly day program beginning in September 2000. (1 Cor. 14: 20) Why will it be valuable for us to attend? We live in a world that is filled with badness. To resist this, we must develop our powers of spiritual understanding so that we can conquer the evil with the good. That is what the special assembly day program will help us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the opening session, the circuit overseer will discuss “Aids to Becoming Full-Grown in Bible Understanding.” He will show us how to become stabilized in Christian faith. The visiting speaker will highlight how actual use, or application, of Bible principles is vital in developing keen perception, as he speaks on the theme “Safeguard Spirituality by Training Your Perceptive Powers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Young people too must develop powers of understanding. This will be discussed in the parts “Why Be Babes as to Badness” and “Youths Who Acquire Understanding Now.” Hear youths tell what they do to fortify themselves spiritually so that they can control any curiosity about the world’s wicked activities and avoid trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How are we to find the greatest happiness in life? The visiting speaker will explain this in the concluding talk “Benefit From Applying Bible Principles With Understanding.” He will give examples to show that applying God’s Word helps us deal with problems, make decisions, and truly benefit from what Jehovah is teaching us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who wish to symbolize their dedication to God by water baptism at the assembly should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. Mark your calendar as soon as the date of the special assembly day is announced, and make definite plans to benefit from this rich program. Do not miss any part of the special assembly day! It will fortify you to endure this evil system and remain faithful to Jehovah.</span></p>

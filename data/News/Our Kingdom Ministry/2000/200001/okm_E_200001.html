<p><span class="font9">----------------------------------------------------------- to go where the people are and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus commissioned his disciples to be witnesses “to the most distant part of the earth,” he had already set the example for them to follow. (Acts 1:8) Whenever and wherever he found people, he talked about God’s purpose for humankind. In imitation of Jesus, the faithful slave class is using a great variety of ways to make Jehovah’s name “known in all the earth.”—Isa. 12:4, 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> What Was Done in Former Days: </span><span class="font9">In years gone by, sermons were published in newspapers; the “Photo-Drama of Creation” was produced and shown to millions; sound cars were used; and extensive use was made of the phonograph and, for a time, radio—all to preach the good news. Of course, primary emphasis has always been placed on making personal contact with people so that the interest found can be cultivated. Consequently, the house-to-house ministry has proved to be a very effective means of making Jehovah’s name known everywhere.—Acts 5:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Is Being Done in Our Day: </span><span class="font9">With changing times the world is moving at a hectic pace, and in many places people are seldom found at home. Few are inclined to spend time reading and meditating on spiritual things. We must therefore adapt our ministry accordingly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to continually covering the territory from house to house, we have been encouraged to be “always ready” to make a defense for the hope within us. (1 Pet. 3:15) This means endeavoring to preach to workmates, to schoolmates, to people on the street and in the park or parking lot, from store to store, and anywhere else that people may be found. Having Jehovah’s backing, our efforts meet with good success. Are you having a share in reaching people wherever they are?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> May we individually leave no stone unturned when it comes to making Jehovah’s name known in our territory. We can find great satisfaction in fully accomplishing our ministry, as we look to Jehovah to draw righthearted ones.—John 6:44.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>A longtime Witness once saidylf you miss the first day of the convention, why, you have just missed too muchl’JWhy did he feel that way? Because the first day is the beginning of a rich spiritual banquet that Jehovah’s organization has prepared for us. [</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Isa. 25:6</span><span class="font9">T Gur being there right from the start shows that we agree with the psalmist’s sentiments: “</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">I re</span><span class="font9">j</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">oiced</span><span class="font9"> when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let ^is go.’ ”—P</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">s. 122</span><span class="font9">:1.7</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font8">Making a Legal Choice for Nonblood Management of Health Care. (Acts 15:28, 29) Talk by a qualified elder, based on question-and-answer guide that accompanies the Society’s health-care durable power of attorney, or proxy, form and the sheet entitled “Information About the Society’s Health-Care Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Forms,” both dated January 1997. Following this meeting, baptized Witnesses may obtain a new Advance Medical Directive/Release card, and those with unbaptized minor children may receive an Identity Card for each child. These cards are not to be filled out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home but NOT signed. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done after the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Before signing, be sure that the cards are filled out completely. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. By adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive to use for themselves and their children. The durable power of attorney, or proxy, form has been prepared by the Society and is a more comprehensive health-care document that provides primary legal protection. Witnesses who have not already filled out this form and who wish to do so can obtain a copy from the congregation secretary. (If a publisher has moved to another state, he would need to execute a new form in order for it to be effective in that state.) Additionally, if a durable power of attorney, or proxy, form has been executed, you should write on the front of the Advance Medical Directive/Release card, preferably in your own hand: “I have also executed a health-care power of attorney.” Book study conductors should be sure that all assigned to their group have the assistance they desire to fill out the Advance Medical Directive/ Release card and durable power of attorney, or proxy, form. For the best possible legal protection, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font8"> documents should be filled out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “The Real Armageddon—Why? When?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 19, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown. </span><span class="font8">Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion, allowing time to greet visitors and encourage newly interested ones. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ The special public talk for the 2000 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 16. The subject of the talk will be “Why Mankind Needs a Ransom.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 16, 2000.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Each day presents new challenges to your faith. Perhaps a worldly acquaintance keeps pressuring you to go out on a date. Your teacher wants you to pursue a secular career, or your employer wants you to work longer hours. Your physical health may be declining. Although such trials may confront you at any time, you are not alone. Jehovah is ready to give you the wisdom needed to cope with them. Considering the Bible text and comments in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> is one means by which you can take in Jehovah’s Word on a regular basis. Do you take advantage of this provision?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Help Is Available: </span><span class="font9">Isaiah 30:20 describes Jehovah as the “Grand Instructor” to whom God’s people can look for help. He supplies you with just what you need to face challenges to your faith. How? The next verse explains: “Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: ‘This is the way. Walk in it.’” Today, Jehovah sends out his “word” through the Scriptures and the publications of ‘the faithful slave.’ (Matt. 24: 45) There is a wealth of wisdom in past </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> articles alone, touching on virtually every aspect of Christian living. Reviewing the ones that are quoted in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> helps you build a storehouse of knowledge that is invaluable in dealing with trials of all sorts.—Isa. 48:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Room for It: </span><span class="font9">Even though mornings were a busy time, one mother made it a point to read and discuss the text and comments with her son while he ate breakfast. These words along with prayer were the last words that he heard each morning before leaving for school. They fortified him to resist sexual advances, to take an uncompromising stand in the face of nationalism, and to give a courageous witness to students and teachers alike. Although he was the only Witness at school, he never felt alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Look to Jehovah and his Word for direction and guidance. If you do so, he will be real to you, like a trusted friend. Turn to him </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">every day! </span><span class="font9">Along with millions of others the world over who daily consult God’s Word, may you find that your eyes become “eyes seeing your Grand Instructor.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Use Tracts to Start Conversations</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Would you not agree that giving an effective witness depends largely on your taking the initiative to start conversations? The challenge is to say something that captures the person’s interest and gets him involved. But how can this be done effectively?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers have found that with a few well-chosen words, offering one of our Bible-based tracts can start conversations. The titles are appealing, and the illustrations are colorful and eyecatching. A tract does not overwhelm a person, giving the impression that there is a lot of information to read. Still, the concise messages in tracts are absorbing and can be used to lead into a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> This is how one Witness personally felt: “In this hurry-up world, people often do not want to take much time to read, but the tracts are just long enough to give an important message but not so long as to turn people away before they even look at it. I read many of the tracts, and I eventually learned the truth.” Never underestimate the power of God’s Word as explained in these brief, printed messages. —Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Four Easy Steps: </span><span class="font9">Many have enjoyed success by using a simple approach. (1) Show a person a few of the tracts and ask him which one would be of interest to him. (2) After the person chooses one, ask a well-prepared question that highlights a main point in the tract. (3) In answer to the question, read an appropriate paragraph or scripture from the tract. (4) If you get a favorable response, continue discussing the contents of the tract or refer to a lesson in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font9">brochure or a chapter in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book that provides further comments. In this way you may be able to lead right into a Bible study. The following suggestions will help you prepare what to say using four of the tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The title of the tract “Who Really Rules the World?” might he posed as a question.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ If in answer to it the person with whom you are talking says “God” or “I don’t know,” read the opening two sentences on page 2 and the first paragraph on page 3. Highlight 1 John 5:19 and Revelation 12:9. Whether or not the person doubts the existence of Satan the Devil or acknowledges his hold on the world, you can pursue the line of reasoning found under the subheading “A Clue From World Conditions” to continue the conversation. If interest is shown, offer to explain where the Devil came from, using the points on pages 3 and 4 of the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> The tract “What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?” may arouse immediate interest. You might initiate a conversation by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Do you think we will ever see our dead loved ones again?” After the person responds, point to the second paragraph on page 4 of the tract and read John 5:28, 29. Then explain that it helps to understand the information under the first subheading in the tract. Offer to discuss it together.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> The “Enjoy Family Life” tract has universal appeal for families. Using it, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “You would probably agree that the family is under attack today. What do you think can be done to strengthen family ties?” After the person responds, direct his attention to the points in the first paragraph on page 6. Pick one of the scriptures quoted on pages 4 and 5 of the tract, and explain what it means. Then offer a free home Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> The tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible” might be used with this presentation: </span><span class="font9">■ “Most people have heard the story of Cain and Abel, which is found in the first book of the Bible. The account in Genesis also refers to Cain’s wife. Have you ever wondered where she came from?” Use the last paragraph on page 2 of the tract to give the answer. Explain that the tract also discusses the Bible’s important comments about what our future holds. Beginning with the third paragraph on page 5, proceed with the discussion, using the supporting scriptures.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Distributing Bible tracts is a time-tested, effective means of presenting the good news. Because they are easy to carry wherever you go, you can use them effectively in your door-to-door activity and when witnessing informally. Tracts play an important role in fulfilling our ministry. Be sure to carry a variety, and use them liberally to start conversations.—Col. 4:17.</span></p></li></ul>

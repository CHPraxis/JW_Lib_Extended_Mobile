<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Your Labor Is Not in Vain”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup>What an encouraging thought! Your labor in Jehovah’s service is not in vain. (1 Cor. 15:58) In contrast, think of how people labor long and hard trying to improve their status in life or their financial situation. They may pursue higher education for years or work slavishly to get ahead materially. Yet, because of “time and unforeseen occurrence,” they may never attain the prestige they are seeking, or they may be forced to settle for much less than they want materially. Like “a striving after wind,” their efforts are in vain. (Eccl. 1:14; 9:11) How vital, then, that we have plenty to do in the only work that is not in vain because it has lasting value!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Work That Really Counts: </span><span class="font8">Preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom is the most important work on earth. It is the work that must be done whether people listen or not. We want to be able to say, as did Paul: “I am clean from the blood of all men, for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God.”—Acts 20:26, 27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> When people listen and respond to the Kingdom message, what joy there is! A young woman lost her aunt in death. She wondered where her aunt had gone—to heaven or to hell? She prayed to God for help, using the name Jehovah, as her sister had taught her to do. Soon she was studying the Bible and attending Christian meetings. She gained a whole new outlook on life and broke her ties with street gangs. The young woman quit smoking, taking drugs, and stealing. She admits: “Only love for Jehovah made me leave such a bad way of life. Only Jehovah in his great mercy could give me the hope of everlasting life.” She is no longer spending her life in vain pursuits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Even when people refuse to listen, you still accomplish something worthwhile. They know that Jehovah’s Witnesses have visited them. Your own integrity, faithfulness, and love are confirmed. So, is your labor in the Lord’s work in vain? Never!</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Be Liberal, Ready to Share”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Centuries ago the apostle Paul instructed Timothy to encourage fellow believers “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share.” (1 Tim. 6:18) Paul also reminded the Hebrew Christians not to forget “the doing of good and the sharing of things with others.” (Heb. 13:16) Why did he write these instructions? Because he knew that there would be “glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good.”—Rom. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> By reason of his Creatorship, Jehovah God is the Owner of all things. (Rev. 4:11) We certainly appreciate what he is doing in our behalf with his belongings. Despite the thankless attitude of many of humankind, the Most High continues to allow all to benefit from his generous provisions for sustaining life. (Matt. 5:45) He even gave his dearest Son as a sacrifice so that we might have life everlasting. Should not the love that we have been shown compel us to prove ourselves thankful by being liberal with fellow humans?—2 Cor. 5:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Can We Share? </span><span class="font8">It is only right that we use whatever assets we have in a way that is pleasing in God’s sight. Surely we want to support the worldwide Kingdom work in a material and spiritual way. Of course, the good news is the most valuable treasure anyone can possess, for it is “God’s power for salvation.” (Rom. 1: 16) By liberally using our time and resources every month to participate in the preaching and teaching work, we may be able to share this spiritual treasure with others, leading to their gaining everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah is very pleased when we assist those of little means. He promises blessings, and he also reminds us: “Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, but righteousness itself will deliver from death.” (Prov. 11:4; 19:17) Supporting the Kingdom work materially and having a full share in preaching the good news are wonderful ways we can show that we really are liberal, ready to share.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">■ Who should offer prayer at congregation meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congregational prayer is a vital part of our worship. Representing others before Jehovah is a precious privilege and a weighty responsibility. In view of its importance, elders need to use good judgment when deciding which brothers qualify to offer prayer at meetings. Baptized brothers representing the congregation should be mature Christian ministers who are known as good examples and have the respect of the congregation. Their reverent and respectful prayers should reveal a fine relationship with Jehovah God. The article “Praying Before Others With a Humble Heart” in the May 15, 1986, issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> outlines important principles that are especially helpful for those who pray publicly on behalf of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The elders would not have a brother offer prayer if he is known for questionable or frivolous conduct. A brother who tends to be disgruntled or inclined to use public prayer as a means to air personal differences would not be chosen. (1 Tim. 2:8) Even though a teenage brother may be baptized, the elders will have to determine whether he has the spiritual stature to pray on behalf of the congregation.—Acts 16:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Occasionally at meetings for field service, it might be necessary for a baptized sister to offer prayer if there is no qualified brother there to represent the group. She would need to wear an appropriate head covering. If it is likely that a qualified brother will not be present at certain meetings for service, the elders should assign a qualified sister to take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is customary for the chairman of the Public Meeting to offer the opening prayer. However, at other congregation meetings, when there are more than a few qualified brothers available, someone other than the brother opening the meeting or the one assigned the final part may be called upon to offer the opening or closing prayers. In any event, the brother who is to be called on to pray at a congregation meeting should be informed beforehand so that he can give thought to what he will say. Then he can offer a coherent, earnest prayer that is appropriate for that particular meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such prayers need not be long. When a brother offers a public prayer, he will usually be better understood if he stands up, expresses himself with sufficient volume, and speaks distinctly. This will allow all of those assembled to hear the prayer and at the close to say a heartfelt “Amen!”—1 Chron. 16:36; 1 Cor. 14:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“How Could I... Unless Someone Guided Me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘When the evangelizer Philip asked the Ethiopian eunuch if he understood what he was reading from God’s Word, the man responded: “Really, how could I ever do so, unless someone guided me?” Philip gladly assisted him to understand the good news about Jesus, resulting in the man’s immediate baptism. (Acts 8:26-38) Philip was obeying the commission from Christ to ‘make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them and teaching them.’ —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We must obey the commission to make disciples, just as Philip did. However, the sort of rapid spiritual progress that the Ethiopian eunuch made is not often seen among the people with whom we study the Bible. That man, a Jewish proselyte well versed in the Scriptures, had a receptive heart and only needed to accept that Jesus was the promised Messiah. It is a challenge if those with whom we study are unfamiliar with the Bible, have been misled by false religious teachings, or are burdened by difficult personal problems. What will help us to be successful in guiding Bible students to dedication and baptism?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Discern the Bible Student’s Spiritual Needs: </span><span class="font8">The August 1998 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font8">insert discussed the length of time that we might study with people, using the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book. It gave this direction: “It is necessary to gauge the pace of the study according to the circumstances and aptitude of the student. ... We do not want to sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding for the sake of speed. Every student needs a solid basis for his newfound faith in God’s Word.” Hence, it is advisable not to rush through the material in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font8">book with the thought of trying to finish the book in six months. It may require much more than six months to help some individuals progress to the point of baptism. As you conduct the study week by week, spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning from God’s Word. In some cases, two or three weeks may be needed to cover one chapter in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book. This will allow time to read and clarify many of the cited scriptures. —Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> However, what if upon completion of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book, you discern that the student’s understanding of the truth needs to be rounded out or that he is not yet fully motivated to take a stand for the truth and dedicate his life to God? (1 Cor. 14:20) What more can you do to guide him onto the road leading to life?—Matt. 7:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Satisfy the Bible Student’s Spiritual Needs: </span><span class="font8">If it is evident that a person is making progress, although slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then continue the Bible study in a second book after the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book are completed. This may not be necessary in every case, but when it is needed, continue the study in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font8"> book, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font8"> book, or the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font8"> book. Most publishers have personal copies of these books to use if the congregation does not have a supply. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font8"> book is the only one that can be ordered from Brooklyn. In all cases, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8"> brochure and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book would be studied first. The Bible study, return visits, and time spent to continue the study should be counted and reported, even if the student gets baptized before completing the second book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Does this mean that those who were recently baptized but who studied only one book should now receive renewed help to study the second book? Not necessarily. However, they may have become inactive or may not have progressed in the truth, and they may feel that they need personal help to make greater application of the truth in their lives. The service overseer should be consulted before a study is revived with a baptized publisher. However, if you know of some who studied the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font8"> book in the past but never progressed to dedication and baptism, you may want to take the initiative to see if they would like to resume their Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> It is a mark of Christian love to give close, personal attention to each interested person with whom we study. Our objective is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth of God’s Word. Then he can take a definite, knowledgeable stand for the truth and dedicate his life to Jehovah, symbolizing that dedication by water baptism. —Ps. 40:8; Eph. 3:17-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Do you remember what happened after the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized? “He kept going on his way rejoicing” as a new disciple of Jesus Christ. (Acts 8:39,40) May we and those whom we successfully guide in the way of the truth find great joy in serving Jehovah God —now and forever!</span></p></li></ul>

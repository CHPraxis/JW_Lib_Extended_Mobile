<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Alert to Offer Bible Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> How thankful we are for the Bible literature Jehovah regularly provides through his organization! We highly value this spiritual food. Upon receiving a new publication, we eagerly leaf through it. Then, as we read it carefully, we gain understanding. Our appreciation for Jehovah and his purposes grows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The personal benefits we receive move us to share with others the good things we have learned. (Matt. 24:14) We are anxious to get the Society’s publications into the hands of as many people as possible. This enables them also to learn the truths contained in these instructive Bible publications. If we are well prepared and alert to take the initiative to present the current literature offer, we may be able to help other sincere people turn to Jehovah and join us in his service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> During January and February we will be offering a variety of 192-page books on a contribution of 50e each. The books to be offered include any 192-page book published prior to 1980 except </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Family Life, Great Teacher, This Life, Truth,</span><span class="font15"> and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Youth.</span><span class="font15"> Congregations that do not have these books in stock may offer the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Worldwide Security</span><span class="font15"> book for a contribution of $1.00.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Our Effectiveness as Ministers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Since Kingdom interests take first place in our lives, we should be motivated to excel in the ministry as our chosen career. (Mark 13:10) No matter how long we may have been preaching, we want to keep on improving our effectiveness as ministers. How can we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Many people who are successful in professional fields continually seek to update their knowledge and skills. Their livelihood may depend on it. As conscientious ministers, we also need to be diligent to improve our ability to make disciples, teaching others about God’s Kingdom. We should look for new and fresh approaches that appeal to all sorts of people.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MEET THE CHALLENGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Now that Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering of sheeplike ones, many of us are calling on our neighbors more often. Increased witnessing activity by so many more publishers and pioneers is stirring up the world field. Because of our increased activity, presentations that were effective at one time may no longer</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Sometimes people are genuinely very busy when we call. Under those circumstances, we may want just to offer the book as suggested in the second example on page 20 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book. Or we might express in our own words something along the lines of the third example on that page, showing appreciation of the householder’s situation and saying in a persuasive way: “But since you don’t have time to talk now, we suggest that you accept these two magazines on a contribution of 50c and read them when it is more convenient. You will enjoy learning about God’s promise of something new.” These approaches show consideration for the householder’s circumstances, and at the same time, the literature is presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> What can be done if a person already has the publication we are offering? Why not apply the Bible principle found at 1 Corinthians 3: 6-9? The seed has already been planted. Take advantage of the opportunity to water it by giving a further witness to the individual. Or we might say something like: “I am very pleased that you already have a copy of this publication. No doubt you have enjoyed reading it. If I</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">appeal to the people we meet. The quality of our ministry may need to be improved.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> It is necessary to maintain a positive attitude in speaking with people in order to be truly skillful in our work. Making good use of the practical suggestions given in the July 15, 1988, issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> can help us in this. For example, page 16, paragraph 6, discusses how to introduce yourself in a pleasant and positive way in territory where you call every week and you are well known. Information on how to approach a person who told you last week, “I am involved in my own church, and it cares for all my spiritual needs,” is found on page 16, paragraph 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Have you worked your territory with a direct offer of a free home Bible study? Do you work business territory held by your congregation? Is it possible to do street witnessing at appropriate and productive hours? By all means, review the fine suggestions given in the July 15, 1988, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font15"> Applying such </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1990 &quot;PURE LANGUAGE&quot; DISTRICT CONVENTION</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> Over the past one hundred years, conventions have been an outstanding feature of our worship. Particularly since the revival of our preaching activity in 1919, these gatherings have been marked periods of spiritual refreshment as revealed flashes of light from God’s Word have been made known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> Recall, for instance, the unbounded joy manifested at Columbus, Ohio, in 1931 when God’s people received the new name, Jehovah’s Witnesses. Also, great rejoicing accompanied the truth revealed at Washington, D.C., in 1935, showing that the destiny of the “great crowd” was to survive into Jehovah’s new world.—Rev. 7:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> As our numbers increased following World War II, it was necessary to spread out over the United States with several district conventions. Six of these were held in 1948 with some 66,000 in attendance. Just 41 years later, over 1,360,000 attended 132 “Godly Devotion” District Conventions. What a tremendous increase in happy con-ventioners! Now it is time to be making the necessary arrangements for attending the 1990 “Pure Language” District Conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>4</sup> All Christians must put language to its most exalted use, praising their Creator and upbuilding their neighbor with wholesome, truthful speech, especially the good news about God’s Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14; Titus 2: 7, 8; Heb. 13:15; compare Psalm 109:30.) The ‘purity’ of this language is also reflected in its being free from words expressing malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and similar abusive speech, as well as being free from deceit, obscenity, and corruptness.—Eph. 4:29, 31; 1 Pet. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>5</sup> Hence, what a pleasure it will be to attend the four-day “Pure Language” District Conventions planned for this summer and receive counsel and encouragement as we continue to speak the “pure language” of the truth in these critical times. (Zeph. 3:9) By making the necessary arrangements to be there, you can share in the fine spiritual blessings that certainly await those in attendance. Truly, we look to Jehovah to make this another thrilling convention season as we move forward in unitedly worshiping him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> Following the Service Meeting for the week of January 1, congregations should post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list for the district convention to which your congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats, food, literature, and rooming accommodations for everyone. As you make your plans, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so they also can attend every session. (Gal. 6:10) The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>7</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: As soon as —but NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the motels, you should phone the motel of your choice and make reservations, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention. Doing so will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases have been greatly reduced. One night’s DEPOSIT WILL BE REQUIRED at all locations in order to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make your reservations. If your deposit is not received by the motel within three weeks, your reservations can be canceled. MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD THE ROOMS OR EXTEND THE SPECIAL RATES WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. Please do not make reservations at more than one motel or at motels that you do not intend to use. (Matt. 5:37) This is unkind because it prevents the motels from getting business they could have had and deprives other publishers from using those rooms, which often are vitally needed. If you must cancel your reservation, you should immediately notify the motel. This makes the room available for other delegates. If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list and so on. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregations with revised lists as long as necessary, deleting motels that have been filled and including additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>8</sup> DORMITORIES: A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all of those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>9</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: This provision is only for baptized Witnesses and unbaptized publishers, including their children, who are all in good standing in the congregation. Arrangements to care for such ones with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf, and perhaps others, which may include taking such ones with them. Publishers may care for such ones in other ways also. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17, 18) Of course, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs who are unable to care for themselves and who cannot be assisted by those in the congregation where they attend. These publishers may ask the congregation secretary for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. The secretary should first speak with the Congregation Service Committee to see if it is possible for the congregation to assist these persons to care for their own rooming accommodations. If not, then he may give them a copy of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Those with special needs are the only ones that should fill out this form. It is to be returned to the secretary and checked for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that qualify the person or persons for special needs consideration, which are to be explained in detail in the space provided on the form. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The secretary will then forward the form to the convention Rooming Department. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations. Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive because the convention Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>10</sup> Private-home accommodations are usually set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford motel rooms but</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">who want free or inexpensive rooms just to as to avoid major difficulties that we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">save money. Similarly, it is not proper for delegates to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days in order to visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period only. Those receiving such accommodations should see that they and their children act respectfully toward the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">home of their host and do not damage anything or rummage through the possessions or private areas in the home. If householders experience any difficulties along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the Rooming Department at the convention, and the brothers there will be happy to help. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font17"><sup>11</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if for some reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, the congregation secretary can give you the address of the convention headquarters where you desire to attend. These addresses are listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Then write to that convention headquarters and request a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, self-addressed envelope.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font17">d) Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and sending the deposits for each room immediately. If a deposit is not received within three weeks after the reservation is made, the motel can cancel the reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">e) Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based upon no more than four or five persons in the room.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective Introductions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> When sharing in the house-to-house work, we are constantly faced with the question, “What will I say first?” Experienced publishers who get good results in the field service offer a number of helpful suggestions. What are some of these?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> First, it is important to be sincerely interested in the people to whom we speak. Such personal interest is demonstrated in both words and actions. It is important to take into consideration the viewpoint of the householder. Ask appropriate questions and then listen carefully to his response. By all means, we must try to help the householder see how he can benefit personally by considering the subject we are discussing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSIDER THEIR VIEWPOINT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> When Jesus was witnessing to the Samaritan woman at a well near Sy-char, some of his expressions sounded strange to her. They were not in harmony with her thinking or the way she worshiped. Jesus carefully listened, and when making a reply, he took into consideration what she said. He wanted to help her. (John 4: 13,14,19-26) Do we endeavor to follow Jesus’ example in this respect as we share in the witness work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> If people in your territory respond to your opening words by saying, “I have my own religion,” what might you do? The Bible writer said: “The heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer.” (Prov. 15:28) Do you do this? Have you considered the information on pages 18-19 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book with the principle of this scripture in mind? You might also work with publishers who are effective in field service in order to learn how to make your introductions more effective.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> In areas where many people use the objection that they have their own religion, you may find it benefi-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Offer Literature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d}</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">may, I would like to point out how you can benefit even more from the book. It will only take a few minutes.” Then demonstrate how we study the Bible with the help of the publication. Our purpose at the door does not change when the householder already has a book. Remember, our primary goal is to “make disciples.”—Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INFORMAL WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> We should also be alert to the many opportunities we may have to present literature in informal witnessing. Think of ways to witness to visitors, relatives, workmates,</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">cial to anticipate their comment and bring up the subject first. For example, after an initial greeting, you might say: “Do you have your own religion? [Listen to their reply.] I thought you might because most people in this area do. However, the reason for my call this morning is ___” Then continue with the subject you wish to discuss.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> If many householders say, “I’m busy,” you could select one or more of the ideas expressed on pages 19-20 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book and adapt them to the needs of your territory. Variations of these expressions may be used in anticipation of objections that are heard frequently.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">USING INTRODUCTIONS FROM THE </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">REASONING</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Many are finding good success in using the introductions on pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book. You will notice that these consider the subjects people are generally concerned with, such as current events, personal safety, employment, housing, family life, and the future. However, notice also that the wording of the suggested introductions in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book invites the householder to express himself. It helps him to see the importance of the subject presented and that it affects him personally. Effective use of these introductions may prevent householders from using some of the more common objections.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Give careful thought to introductions that you believe will be most effective in your territory. Learn to use the introductions in the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book. Benefit from the experience of other publishers. Pray for Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts. With good effort and Jehovah’s blessing, it may be that more people in your territory will respond favorably I to the good news of salvation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">schoolmates, people we meet when shopping, and those we meet between homes or doors when we are in the field service. Plan ahead, having literature available to present on such occasions whenever possible. Often, it is not difficult to carry one or more of the small publications with us. Much good can be accomplished through informal witnessing.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah’s organization has generously supplied us with literature to keep us spiritually strong and to aid us in spreading the good news. Being alert to opportunities to offer Bible literature will help us magnify Jehovah’s name.—Ps. 34:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using Tracts Effectively</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> During the 1987 “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention, four new tracts were released. They are entitled </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible, What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?, Life in a Peaceful New World, </span><span class="font15">and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </span><span class="font15">Have you been using these tracts effectively in the field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers leave tracts at doors where no one is at home. And they give them to people who are too busy to listen at the time a call is made. Some find that if they use a tract to introduce themselves at the door, it helps to stimulate the householder’s interest. Others prefer offering them as a free gift on calls where no literature is placed but where some interest is shown.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN AND HOW TO USE THEM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> By being versatile and alert to opportunities, you may find many occasions to offer tracts. For instance, tracts can be helpful when witnessing to relatives. You can use tracts when you are on vacation, while shopping and traveling, at school, or at your place of employment. Do you keep tracts within easy reach, perhaps in your coat or shirt pocket, purse, or briefcase? Having tracts with you at all times may encourage you to witness informally. Why not look for occasions to offer tracts?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Regardless of the occasion, you can use the tracts to give a more effective witness. Although the message they contain is brief, what they say is very convincing and is supported with clear Scriptural argumentation. The tracts are colorfully illustrated and can be useful tools to accomplish much good in the ministry. Be alert to offer them to people everywhere.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">Improving Effectiveness </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font15">suggestions can help us to improve our effectiveness as ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Being effective also involves thoroughness. (Eph. 6:13) Be alert to notice where more than one family lives in a house. Some people live in basement apartments, above garages, or in other locations not directly accessible from the front door. Seek out various family members —an older person who may not ordinarily come to the door or someone who may be at work when calls are usually made at the home. It may be that by calling at another hour, you may meet other family members. Evening witnessing often provides such opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IN FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Have you taken advantage of the thought-provoking titles of the tracts to cultivate interest in the Kingdom message when working from house to house? Some publishers highlight the title of a tract right away in their introduction. Why not try this approach yourself? You might say: “Hello. I’m glad to find you at home. I have volunteered to share in delivering a very important message. It is found in this tract </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font15"> This is your copy. It is free. [Give it to the householder, and direct attention to the cover.] Wouldn’t you like to live in such peaceful surroundings?” If circumstances then allow, continue with the Topic for Conversation, and tie in the offer for the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Depending on where you live, you may find it beneficial to state that your message is from the Bible. The tract </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible </span><span class="font15">may be very effective in your area. For instance, you might say: “We are leaving a free Bible message with our neighbors today. Here is your copy. [Give it to the householder.] Notice the subject is about the Bible. Do you think that people have lost confidence in the Bible today? [Allow for a response.] This tract will help you see why we can trust what the Bible says.” Continue with the Topic for Conversation, showing the blessings God has in store for the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Distributing Bible tracts is a time-tested and effective means of presenting the “good news.” (Matt. 24: 14) They play an important role in our public ministry and when we are witnessing informally. Let us use our beautiful tracts effectively to give a fine witness and thus help others learn about God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Improving our effectiveness in the ministry is a worthy goal most of us can attain. It takes heartfelt prayer and advance preparation. As our effectiveness in the field service grows, we may be able to help someone else to make similar progress.—Gal. 6:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Remember, our teaching work will not end with the “great tribulation.” (Matt. 24:21) We anticipate years of helping resurrected ones to learn Jehovah’s ways. Our joy during the Millennium will surely abound as we see taught ones loyally submit to Christ’s reign. By improving our effectiveness in the preaching and teaching work, we can accomplish more in our ministry—to the honor and praise of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Identifying Kingdom Halls</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Each Kingdom Hall should be clearly identified by an appropriate sign that reads: “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.” The sign should be neat, in good taste, and well maintained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Where congregations using different languages meet in the same Kingdom Hall, ordinarily a Kingdom Hall sign should be posted in each language. This undoubtedly makes it easier for people who speak those languages to identify our place of worship. The bodies of elders of the congregations concerned should be able to make arrangements for posting appropriate Kingdom Hall signs in the languages of the congregations using a particular Kingdom Hall. —Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, where practical, meeting times should be posted and kept up-to-date. A Kingdom Hall used by more than one language group should have a composite sign signifying the meeting times of each language group.</span></p></li></ul>

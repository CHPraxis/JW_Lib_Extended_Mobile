<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeph. 2:2, 3—Practise God’s judicial decisions.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Become Skilful in Your Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul encouraged the developing of skill in the ministry. He wrote: “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.&quot; —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Skill in the ministry is acquired. Therefore, we must ‘do our utmost’ —put forth earnest effort—if we are going to be skilful ministers. But what will help us?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">LEARN FROM GOD S WORD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our personal knowledge of the Scriptures has a direct hearing on our effectiveness as ministers. The better acquainted we are with what the Bible teaches, the more effective we will be in “handling the word of the truth aright.&quot; So it is vital to set aside time for personal study.—1 Tim. 4:15. 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■' Another means of getting acquainted with God’s Word is “to pay more than the usual attention” to the Bible-based instruction received at</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Kingdom Is The Solution</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember how you felt when you first grasped the significance of God’s Kingdom? It is, indeed, glorious good news! The Kingdom message was kept to the fore in Jesus’ life and ministry. Zealously he preached it and urged his followers to do the same. At Matthew 10:7 he said, “As you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’’’ Have 19 centuries of time diminished the force of God’s Kingdom? Not at all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-’ Over the centuries, governments of all kinds have come and gone. The inadequacy of human rulership has been eloquently underscored. The disastrous failure of man-made rule has never been more manifest than during the past decade. One thing remains firm, real and alive with hope, namely God’s Kingdom backed by the irresistible power of the Sovereign of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PRESENT SURVIVAL BOOK DURING JUNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah has provided a fine instrument to present the Kingdom message during June. The book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Survival Into a New Earth</span><span class="font12"> is topical for our time. While some nations are trying to resolve political differences and thereby lessen world tensions, we know they cannot bring lasting peace on earth. Greed continues to goad mankind on in his abuse of the atmosphere and decongregation meetings. (Heb. 2:1) Excellent talking points for the ministry are discussed in public talks or can be gleaned from the Congregation Book Study. The Theocratic Ministry School furnishes us with valuable training to be skilled teachers, and the Service Meeting provides helpful suggestions and practical demonstrations to assist us in becoming more proficient as ministers. However, to gain the greatest benefit, we need to be well-prepared and actively participate in all the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">APPLY SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Paul told the congregation in Philippi to practise the things they learned in connection with him. (Phil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> 4:9) We too need to put into practice the things we learn through Jehovah’s organization. For example, in the July 15, 1988, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">pages 15-20, we learned ways in which we can develop “new&quot; territory in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">struction of earth’s natural resources. Many see this planet’s future under man’s rule as bleak and frightening. (Luke 21:26) The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Survival</span><span class="font12"> book can build a solid hope in God’s Kingdom for a secure future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Be positive in the presentation of this publication. Analyse the topic for conversation. What do we want to convey to the householder? What are the key points of the Scriptures? It is not always necessary to read the entire text. The main phrases may be sufficient. Once you have the principal idea of the topic for conversation in mind, next select your introduction. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book has a number of introductions dealing on the future and Kingdom hope. What page and or illustration will you highlight in the book? Many find the illustrations on pages 5 and 33 helpful to use in their presentation. Paragraph 4, on page 6, is very topical. Be sure you have a positive conclusion such as, “We leave the publication for a contribution of $1.50. I would enjoy leaving a copy with you.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is becoming more evident that people no longer have faith in promises promoted by governments or other worldly institutions. May we use our time effectively during June to preach the positive message of God’s Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">8 mln: Local announcements and appropriate Announcements from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> Include field service arrangements for weekend.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">areas that are frequently worked. In addition to emphasizing the need for a fresh, appealing, and positive approach, the article encouraged us to condition the householder to expect us to call regularly. Counsel was given to be thorough in searching out deserving ones, seeking out different individuals living under the same roof. By applying these suggestions, we are practising the things we learn and improving our skills in the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Do we regularly use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book in the field ministry? The suggested introductions as well as the section on how to respond to potential conversation stoppers can sharpen our witnessing skills. Additionally, preparing and rehearsing the Topic for Conversation and the way we will present the offer for the month will contribute to our success in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> If you would like additional suggestions on how to improve your ministry, approach the service overseer or your book study conductor and ask for assistance. All of us can improve our skills as ministers, “handling the word of the truth aright.” In just a little while, Jehovah God will bring an end to this wicked system. Until then, our heartfelt desire is to help as many people as we can to gain salvation and thereby bring honour to our God Jehovah.—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">Song 177 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hospital Information Services</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">You were no doubt pleased to hear about the formation of hospital liaison committees, as announced in our recent letter to the congregations. These will function under the direction of a new department at Bethel, known as Hospital Information Services. At present these committees are busy updating our list of helpful surgeons. They are also now visiting various hospitals to try to develop improved arrangements for treating Witness patients.—Compare Proverbs 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hospital Information Services will also try to help you if it has not been possible for you or a nearby hospital liaison committee to find a cooperative doctor or surgical team when needed. This would be when dootors you have contacted have refused to proceed with needed surgery or treatment unless you permit the use of blood transfusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 213</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Local announcements. Relate one or two field experiences had by publishers using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Survival</span><span class="font12"> book. Announce titles of brochures available in congregation for use in field service during July. Demonstrate how a brochure may be used in local territory. Encourage publishers to share in field service this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: &quot;Presenting the Good News—As a Family.&quot; A question-and-answer coverage of material. Ask only one or two questions on each paragraph so that paragraphs may be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Help at the Right Time.” Service overseer discusses information with audience. Highlight benefits of arrangement for service overseer to visit Congregation Book Study groups. Encourage all to make special effort to share in week’s activity during visit of service overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 214 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Schedule for congregation studies in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">June 4: Pages 286* to 290&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">June 11: Pages 290* to 295*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">June 18: Pages 295' to 300</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">June 25: Pages 301 to 305'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">* To or from chapter heading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">• To or from second subheading.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">It is not, however, a department for finding you a new family doctor because you have moved or your former doctor has retired or died. You can ask in your own congregation for the names of doctors the local brothers go to for general medical attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Elders who make up the hospital liaison committees sometimes have to make long-distance telephone calls to various specialists and treatment centres in their efforts to aid a brother in finding a surgeon who will respect his stand on blood. Of course, when this is the case, the costs for these calls are obviously those of the patient, as are all other expenses of his illness and medical care.—Rom. 13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With you we pray that this new arrangement will prove to be a protection and help for our brothers. —John 13:35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satisfying Your Spiritual Need</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) Why is it so important to be conscious of our spiritual need? How can we manifest that we are conscious of it? What pitfalls must we avoid, and what blessings will result from being conscious of our spiritual need?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Doubtless all of us are familiar with the relationship between our physical well-being and proper diet. A person cannot continually neglect his physical needs and expect to perform quality work day in and day out. The same principle applies if we neglect feeding ourselves spiritually.—Matt. 4:4; John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">MEETINGS HELP TO SATISFY NEEDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> There is a direct relationship between our spiritual well-being and our spiritual feeding program. At our meetings, “the faithful and discreet slave” provides a fine spiritual menu to satisfy our need. (Matt. 24:45-47) Each meeting serves a specific purpose, and none should be neglected. Do you prepare for all the meetings and attend them regularly?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Help at the</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Because of his genuine concern for the congregation, Jesus will always provide “help at the right time.” (Heb. 4:16) Much of the needed help is provided through “gifts in men,” as promised at Ephesians 4:8, 11, 12. One such gift is the service overseer in each congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In what ways can the service overseer help us? There are several: (1) He strives to keep all of us conscious of the importance of the preaching and disciple-making work. (2) He is concerned that good organization and leadership in the field are being provided through the Congregation Book Study groups. (3) He is interested in seeing that each of us is given the personal help needed to improve our effectiveness as ministers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">SERVICE OVERSEER VISITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In addition to the regular fine assistance provided through the Congregation Book Study arrangement, special provisions have been made for us to receive help on a personal basis. The service overseer usually is assigned to conduct a Congregation Book Study, but once each month he leaves his own group to work with one of the other book studies for a week. His assistant fills in while he is gone. He informs the study conductor in advance of his visit so that the group can make necessary plans to benefit fully from the week’s activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Let us briefly consider just three of our five weekly meetings. The principal meeting designed to keep us abreast of advancing truth is the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study. The Theocratic Ministry School can help us to become proficient as ministers. The Congregation Book Study provides for a careful study of various Bible subjects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Do you prepare for congregation meetings? Some may skim through the study material, quickly underlining answers to the questions, but not look up the cited scriptures. They may be somewhat prepared to comment, but do they get the full amount of spiritual nourishment available? Is there room for improvement in the way that you and your family prepare for meetings?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">BUY OUT TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When you set aside time to prepare for meetings, do not permit television or any other less important activity to interfere with your plans. Family heads, especially, should help</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Right Time</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> During this special week, the book study is conducted in the usual way for 45 minutes. This allows 15 minutes for the service overseer to give an encouraging talk designed to help us improve in our evangelizing work. It is important for all publishers, as well as newly interested ones, to be present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> All publishers in the group being visited should arrange to have a full share in service during this special visit, especially on the weekend. Where appropriate, evening witnessing may be organized for that week. One of the goals of the service overseer is to work in the service with as many publishers as possible. Perhaps he can accompany some of us on our return visits and Bible studies. Any who feel the need for assistance or encouragement in the ministry can approach him requesting help. Also, we can receive benefits by attending the meetings for field service that he conducts for the group that week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The service overseer takes time to discuss the activity of the group with the study conductor. Regular arrangements for service are reviewed to make sure that things are organized in a practical way that is convenient for all. If some need help or encouragement to share regularly in the ministry, he may talk to them privately and offer some kindly suggestions that will help them improve. The service overseer can make arrangements to call on irregular publishers with the study conductor. Also, he can review the file of Bible study reports with the book study conductor for that group. Perhaps they can accompany some of the publishers on their home Bible studies and offer spiritual encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> In congregations having many book studies, the visits of the service overseer will be less often. Therefore, all should make an extra effort to benefit fully when he visits. During the visit, take note of the suggestions given for improving your ministry and make diligent effort to apply them before the next visit. Of course, he is available in the congregation to provide assistance at any time we are in need of it. In congregations having few Congregation Book Studies, the service overseer will endeavour to visit each group at least every six months.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>K</sup> Our willingness to cooperate with the service overseer and give wholehearted support when he visits our Congregation Book Study will help us to increase our effectiveness in the disciple-making work and And greater joy in our ministry.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Family</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> A dedicated family fully engaged in sacred service—with the father, mother, and children serving God whole-souled—is a praise to Jehovah’s great name. We are happy that many such families are to be found in congregations of Jehovah’s people earth wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Of course, the father has the first responsibility to care for the spiritual needs of his family. (1 Cor. 11:3) With the cooperation of his wife and children, his family can exert a strong influence on others. (Matt. 5:16) What are some areas where this cooperation can be manifested?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">PARENTS TAKE THE LEAD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In many instances, the father may be an elder or a ministerial servant. This means that in addition to the interests of his family, some of his time and attention must be given to congregation matters. The father’s responsibility is to see to it that the available time is apportioned so that his family is not neglected. This may not always be easy in view of the demands made on his limited time. But because his family is his primary responsibility, he should regularly schedule some of his valuable time to be with his family in study, in field service, at meetings, and in suitable recreation. Circumstances and other responsibilities may alter the father’s schedule on occasion, but how rewarding it is when he can spend time every month in field service with members of the family!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Cooperation from the wife is vital. She can complement her husband in a most important way by helping train the children in the ministry. Her exemplary zeal and devotion will do much to influence the children to grow in their appreciation for the ministry.—2 Tim. 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are many fine examples of situations in which one parent carried the spiritual load of responsibility and successfully trained the chil-</span><span class="font11">Spiritual Need &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">their families stick to a regular program of Bible study, preparation for meetings, and participation in field service. All should take seriously the apostle Paul’s counsel to ’buy out the opportune time’ and give priority to our spirituality.—Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> By being conscious of our spiritual need, we will avoid the pitfalls of complacency, or self-satisfaction. As individuals and as families, we have real spiritual needs. Our everlasting happiness depends on the efforts we put forth to satisfy our spiritual need. dren in the ministry. Because of the excellent example of their mother or father, many young people have taken a firm stand for the truth, even taking up the full-time ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">CHILDREN'S RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>c</sup> What about the responsibility of the children? Even the perfect Son of God, Jesus, while still a young child, was subject to the direction and instruction of his parents. (Luke 2:51) Therefore, when father and mother arrange for the family to spend time together in the ministry, it is the obligation of the children to show their godly devotion by cooperating with their parents.—Eph. 6:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Worshipping together as a family —studying, sharing in the field ministry, and attending meetings— strengthens the bonds of love and unity in the family circle. Parents and children share responsibility in this regard.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• Before being approved for baptism, to what extent should an unbaptized publisher be sharing in the field ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">One who qualifies as an unbaptized publisher has already demonstrated in a variety of ways his strong desire to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Ps. 110:3) A diligent study of the Scriptures has brought about a change in his thinking, attitude, and way of life. Stemming from a heartfelt desire to please Jehovah and do His will, such a serious Bible student associates regularly with Jehovah’s people at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. (Heb. 10:24,25) Besides regular attendance at such Christian gatherings, likely he has also been moved from the heart to make public declaration of his faith by offering comments at the meetings, and probably he has enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School.—Ps. 40:9, 10; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">am </span><span class="font12">p. 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Once a Bible student embraces the truth and shows he genuinely appreciates the value of the Kingdom message, he may have the privilege of sharing in the house-to-house ministry. This is the primary work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Matt. 24:14; 28: 19, 20; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font12"> p. Ill) In this connection, both the publisher conducting the study and the elders have a serious responsibility to make certain that the student’s entire life is in harmony with Christian principles. He should have a real desire to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and appreci-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC NEWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">« On January 23, 1990, the Benin government officially lifted the ban on the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in that country. On January 28 the brothers rejoiced to be able to meet together for a special meeting held in Cotonou, and now they look forward to stepping up their theocratic work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• On March 14, 1990, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) issued a document granting religious freedom to Jehovah’s Witnesses in that land and legalizing their work. Thanks to Jehovah, our brothers there are happily and zealously participating openly in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">It need not be a very long time from when a Bible student qualifies to share with us in the ministry until he is able to present himself for water baptism. By now his life course is already in full harmony with Christian principles, but he lacks experience in the public ministry. He should be allowed sufficient time to demonstrate that he is steadfastly determined to have a regular and zealous share in the field ministry.—Ps. 40:8; Rom. 10:9,10, 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the time the person is ready for baptism, most likely he will be regularly sharing the good news with others, spending more than just an hour or two in the field service each month. (w84 6/1 p. 8 par. 2) Of course, the personal circumstances of each one requesting baptism should be reviewed, taking into consideration background, age, limitations, and so forth.

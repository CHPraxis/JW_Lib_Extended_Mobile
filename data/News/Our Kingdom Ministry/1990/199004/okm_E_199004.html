</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Understanding the role of Jesus Christ in the outworking of Jehovah’s purposes is vital. Jesus gave his life as a ransom for obedient mankind. (Matt. 20:28) Without Jehovah’s loving provisions through Jesus Christ, we would continue to be in a dying condition with no hope for the Future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> During the Memorial season especially, we reflect on Jes</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">us’ li</span><span class="font13">fe, his teachings, and his sacrifice. (Luke 22:19) Appreciating that (“God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,”/we are motivated to honor God and Christ by enthusiastically sharing with others the good news. How can we do this?—Rom. 5:8, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMONSTRATING GRATITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We recognize that Jehovah’s visible organization wo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">rks unde</span><span class="font13">r the headship of Jesus. Here on earth, the faithful slave class gives us the spiritual nourishment we need. From his youth onward, Jesus showed deep appreciation for his Father’s Word, and we want to followhis example by studying and digesting the spiritual food provided with a view to teaching others effectively. (Matt. 24:45, 46; Luke 2:46-50) Our gr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">atitud</span><span class="font13">e for the organization and' the spiritual provisions it supplies is shown by our following its direction and cooperating with the elders.</span></p></li>

Despite being thrown into prison and threatened, these apostles fearlessly and boldly contin</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ued</span><span class="font13"> speaking the truth. (Acts &quot;4: 18-20, 23, 31b) Paul too </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">boldly car</span><span class="font13">ried on. with his ministry in difficult territory even though he experienced much persecution.—Acts 20: 20; 2 Cor. 11:23, 28.</span></p>

The apostle Paul </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font13">swers that question at lDigSsa’-lopiaps_2;2, where he says,.“We mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God. &quot;I as well as the other disciples were able to proclaim the good news boldly. After being released from their prison bonds, Peter and John reportwhat we learn from God’s Word. Jesus was a high priest without fault, “separated from the sinners.&quot; (Heb. 7:26) He was not guilty of saying one thing and doing another. As fellow slaves, we need to live up to the same high standard. So when we tell others about the righteous new system Jehovah has promised, we want to be living now in a way that will identify us with that new world.—Matt. 7:21; 1 John 2:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PREACHING UNDER CHRIST’S HEADSHIP</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> During April and May, we will offer the WatcAfower subscrip_tiojCLOn a donation basis. We can honor Jesus by showing prospective readers that the purpose of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font13">as explained on page 2 of each issue, is to encourage “faith in the nowreigning King, Jesus Christ, whose shed blood opens the way for mankind to gain eternal life.” Be sure to offer the subscription </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">firs</span><span class="font13">t whenever possible. If the subscription is not accepted, you may present two magazines and a brochure, thus planting some seeds of truth. Publishers must be discerning so that magazines and especially subscriptions are not wasted. (Isa. 26:10) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">After</span><span class="font13"> accepting a subscription, those who are truly interested will generally show it by a donation. When an interested person cannot give a donation and a subscription is placed, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 2) </span><span class="font13">ed back to their fellow disciples.

<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Be Wise—Apply the Things That You Learn</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> It is the goal of most humans to live a happy, peaceful life. Thousands of books and articles give advice on how to have a successful marriage, how to raise children, how to succeed financially, how to acquire and maintain good health, and numerous other subjects related to helping people achieve happiness. Although some practical wisdom may be found in worldly publications, most people in the world are anything but happy and peaceful. Why is this so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The answer can be found in the Bible at Proverbs 1:7, which says: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge. Wisdom and discipline are what mere fools have despised.” A person cannot expect to have peace and happiness if he does not acknowledge and respect the Source of true knowledge and wisdom, Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> The world is spiritually impoverished —famished. Ironically, this sad state of affairs is self-imposed, since an abundance of spiritual food is available to all throughout the earth, and it is free for the taking. (Prov. 1:20, 21; Rev. 22:17) Because people in the world reject wisdom from Jehovah, they continue to stumble about in spiritual darkness. (Prov. 1:22-32) On the other hand, as Jehovah’s people, who respect his laws and follow his commandments, we are spiritually well-fed and happy. (Isa. 65:13,14) Also, the love that abounds in God’s organization identifies us as Christ’s true disciples. (John 13:35) Yes, the worldwide brotherhood of Jehovah’s Witnesses gives living proof that adherence to Bible teachings is the wise course to follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Still, some who are associated with Jehovah’s organization may not be experiencing the happiness that could be theirs. They may even adversely affect the happiness of others around them by the things they say and do. How could this be so? It is simply because they do not apply God’s wisdom in their lives. They may attend congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, and district conventions. They may be up-to-date on what the Society’s publications say, but their life-style and the manner in which they deal with others, including fellow Christians, does not reflect application of the truth they have learned. What needs to be done? Such persons need to concentrate on “sowing with a view to the spirit” so that they may bring true happiness into their own lives and contribute to the happiness of those around them.—Gal. 6:7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> If we individually become lax, let down our guard, and succumb to Satan, the world, or our imperfect flesh, we will lose the joy of having a close relationship with Jehovah. Now, more than ever before, it is necessary to be alert to apply the things we learn at our congregation meetings and assemblies cis well as through other provisions of the organization. The world in which we live is a dangerous place that is constantly changing. We need to be alert to apply the counsel Jehovah lovingly provides through “the faithful and discreet slave,” recognizing it as food at the proper time.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> In the current program for our special assembly day, much good information is provided on how to stand firm as one flock. Practical suggestions are given on how to combat weakening influences, such as discouraging circumstances, the worldly spirit of independence, and time-wasting distractions. Are we putting into practice the good counsel to trust fully in Jehovah and his ways, to recognize and submit to theocratic authority, to be humble and modest, and to buy out the opportune time for theocratic pursuits? (Mic. 6:8; Eph. 5:15, 16; Heb. 6:10; 13:17) Are family members helping one another to conform to a Christian course of life? Our selection of entertainment, our habits, and our daily routines should be affected by the counsel we receive from the Scriptures. Unless there is diligent effort to apply the things learned, there will be little or no spiritual progress, and our peace of mind and happiness will be affected adversely.—Phil. 4:7-9; Jas. 1:22-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> A concerted effort in personal and family study is needed. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font15"> can direct us to detailed information about the application of Bible principles. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font15"> book is an excellent aid for parents to use in helping their children cope with today’s complicated satanic world. By referring to such material, we will get Jehovah’s viewpoint on matters and can be guided by righteous principles. Not doing this would be like having medicine for an illness but never taking it, even though we know it would alleviate the malady afflicting us. Regular personal and family study will make our faith grow and give us the strength to endure. In a time of testing, our faith will not wither, causing us to fall away.—Matt. 13:6; Luke 8:13; Heb. 2:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Elders and ministerial servants must set an example in presiding over their households. This would include helping their wives and children to apply the things they are learning from God’s Word and organization so as to keep spiritually strong. In this way, the family as a whole can be exemplary in Christian living and provide encouragement for others inside and outside the congregation.—Eph. 6:4; 1 Tim. 3:4, 12, 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO TO HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> Among those attending the Memorial each year are many who need further encouragement to apply what they learn and to associate actively with the organization. Loving consideration can be shown to our Bible students by teaching them how to apply Bible principles in their lives and how to carry out God’s righteous commands. We should demonstrate concern for those who are progressing toward becoming our brothers and sisters in the faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> Any who have become irregular or inactive should be helped to see the need to share in regular activity with the organization. They need to regain the peace and happiness that they previously enjoyed when serving Jehovah more fully. (John 13: 17) By kindly helping them to rekindle their appreciation for the truth and “offer to God a sacrifice of praise,” they will be able to apply the things they learn and stay on the road to life.—Heb. 13:15; see </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font15"> June 1979, page 7, and February 1977, page 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> All God’s people need to keep pace with Jehovah’s fast-moving organization. We cannot allow ourselves to be lured into complacency. We must always maintain our spirituality, keeping abreast of the latest information provided through God’s organization and making ready application of it. This takes diligent effort and at times personal sacrifice. But Jehovah does not ask of us what we are not capable of doing. He is our Creator, and he knows what is best for us. Let us therefore prove ourselves wise by continuing to be taught by Jehovah and to apply the things we learn. This will bring praise to him and result in everlasting benefit for us.—Isa. 48:17; 54:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial —The Christian Celebration</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus instituted the Memorial on Nisan 14, 33 C.E., and he instructed his apostles: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) The apostle Paul explained that by so doing “you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.” (1 Cor. 11:26) It is fitting to memorialize Jesus’ death because of all it accomplishes in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose. The ransom sacrifice provides the very basis for our faith and gives us hope of future existence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Since the beginning of the Christian congregation, Jesus’ disciples have faithfully celebrated the Memorial of his death. In modern times it was reported as early as 1899 that 2,501 in the United States participated in the Memorial celebration. Now, 91 years later, Nisan 14 falls on Tuesday, April 10, after sundown, and close to two million people in the United States are expected to observe this annual celebration.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARATION REQUIRED BY ELDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In view of the importance of this occasion and the expected large attendance, the congregations make advance preparation. (1 Cor. 14:40) Ritual and stiff formality are not involved. No, for at Matthew 26:26-30 we note the simplicity with which this very important celebration was initiated by Jesus. (1 Cor. 11:23-26) But some essential details must be observed if the Memorial is to be celebrated correctly. What do these include?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Among other things, the elders make sure that respect is shown for the Lord’s Evening Meal by having the proper type of emblems. Unleavened bread, such as unseasoned Jewish matzoth, made only with wheat flour and water may be used. Also, only an unadulterated red grape wine, such as Chianti, Burgundy, or a claret, should be used. A homemade red wine may be used if it has not been sweetened, spiced, or fortified.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> A huge crowd of people who are not yer Witnesses show respect, for Jesus by attending the Me</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">moria</span><span class="font13">l. Could these be helped to make greater spiritual progress through a personal Bible study? It would be good</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The elders will also want to select brothers who are exemplary and well-qualified, preferably elders or ministerial servants, to serve the emblems. They should be well-organized and should understand precisely what their assignment entails. Those serving as attendants should be briefed as to their duties, such as directing persons into and out of the hall as well as controlling the added automobile traffic. Particularly is this important in cases where several congregations will be using the same Kingdom Hall or Kingdom Hall complex. Arrangements should also be made to ensure that the speaker is properly informed of the time and place of the celebration.—For additional reminders on things to prepare for the Memorial, see </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> February 15,1985, page 19, and February 15,1990, pages 16-18; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> March 1989, page 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONAL PREPARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>G</sup> All of us should endeavor to derive full benefit from this most sacred celebration. Among other things, we can prepare ourselves mentally by following closely the Bible reading for April 5-10, as noted on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1990 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </span><span class="font13">Also, we should make plans to invite and assist as many persons as possible to attend this very special occasion. And we should make those who attend feel welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> By thorough advance preparation, we will show that we view attendance at the Memorial as a privilege and as an opportunity to show appreciation for the sacrifice of Christ. May this year’s Memorial celebration prove to be a time of upbuilding encouragement to all of Jehovah’s servants. May it instill in all of us the spirit of confidence displayed by Jesus. Our trust in Jehovah will help us conquer the world and gain our respective rewards. —John 16:33; 2 Pet. 1:10; Rev. 7: 9,10, 14.</span></p>

With loving assistance, some may progress to the point of sharing in the ministry before the next celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> How thankful we are for the loving sacrifice of our Redeemer, Jesus! He has provided us with a sure hope.

Or they have enabled us to learn the true meaning of “the signs of the times” that perplex mankind today. (Matt. 16:3) Others would say that they have been comforted by the good news that God’s Kingdom will soon destroy those who oppress their fellowmen. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> has championed that thought from its very beginning over 110 years ago. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> has alerted people to the significance of the events in our time for over 70 years.

But this did not hi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nder them</span><span class="font13"> nor diminish the intensity with which they preached. In fact, such opposition often gave them gr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eater opportunitie</span><span class="font13">s to spread the Kingdom good news. (Acts 4: 3, 8-13a) Because of our Christian adherence to God’s Word on vital issues, we are oftentimes called on to give a reason for our stand.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Auxiliary pioneering affords us greater opportunities to declare the is necessary in order to “keep living.” (Prov. 9:1-6) Being thus convinced, we will offer the subscription with a positive attitude, recognizing that we have what others need. Carefully pore over each issue to find statements that you believe may be helpful to householders. Such advance preparation will aid you in reflecting a positive spirit when presenting these magazines in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In the past, some may have been negative about offering subscriptions. Perhaps the cost of the subscription has held some publishers back from offering it. Offering subscriptions on a complete donation basis should prove exciting to all proclaimers of the good news. It will also be challenging. Why? Costs for mailing, paper, and printing presses continue to rise. We cannot afford to waste our valuable magazines. For the Society’s subscription arrangement to continue, contributions to the Society for its worldwide work will have to keep pace with these costs.</span></p></li></ul>

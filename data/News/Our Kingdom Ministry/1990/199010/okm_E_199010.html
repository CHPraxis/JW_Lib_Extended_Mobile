<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Bible does not leave us in doubt about the kind of territory that the apostles and early Christian disciples had. Not long after Jesus’ death, the authorities warned them not “to make any utterance or to teach” about Jesus. (Acts 4:18) Why? One reason was the amazing success they were having. Thousands were becoming believers, as Acts 4:4 reports: \“Many of those who fiad listened to the speech believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.” &quot;)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Because we also continue teaching without letup, hundreds of thousands, yes, millions are becoming believers in </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">our day</span><span class="font11">. Dunne October we have the privilege of offering </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A wake! </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> on a subscription basis,. There is no doubt that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> has played an important part in making people conscious of their spiritual need. This has led to happiness for many, as they have learned to do Jehovah’s will.—Compare Matthew 5:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REACH EVERYONE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Even though we may have territory that is frequently worked, it may still be possible to speak with some who have had little opportunity to hear the good news. How so? In territory that is inaccessible in the door-to-door ministry, why not take advan</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach Hearts Through Effective Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus found delight in doing his Father’s will, and he took pleasure in helping others also to serve Jehovah. (Ps. 40:8; Matt. 9:37, 38; 11:28-30) Jesus was not content merely to deliver his message. If we are to be successful in encouraging others to join us in the evangelizing work, we must reach the hearts of our Bible students. This involves more than conducting a question-and-answer discussion of a publication. To reach the heart, we need to prepare with our student in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus took a personal interest in others. He considered their point of view. He used illustrations to simplify difficult subjects. (Matt., chaps. 5-7) Discerning problems they would face, Jesus gave appropriate counsel. (Mark 9:33-37) When his listeners were unable at first to grasp the point of his teaching, he patiently illustrated what he had to say. (Matt. 16:5-12) Jesus’deep-seated interest in others should motivate us to ask, ‘If I were the student, what would I need to know in order to understand and be motivated by what is tage of the suggestion made at our district convention and in Owr </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> for July 1990 to share in te</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">lephone</span><span class="font11"> wit</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">nessing</span><span class="font11">? Or make a special effort to speak with the man of the house when engaging in ev</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ening o</span><span class="font11">r weekend witnessing. By keeping good house-to-house records, we may be able to seek out other family members, such as a grandmother, a nephew or.co.usin. who goes to school, or a sister-in-law who works during the week. The extra effort made to speak with e</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ach membe</span><span class="font11">r of^the family may be well rewarded.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There are many fine ways to obtain subscriptions during the month. One would be to invite our Bible students and other interested persons to subscribe. Perhaps one of our Bible studenfSAlready subscribes to one of the magazines. Why not suggest he receive both? Families may be encouraged to obtain a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription for each member so they can prepare for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study. Another suggestion would be to develop magazine routes and then offer subscriptions tbThose who are showing more than the usual interest. We should also offer </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">to study</span><span class="font11"> the Bible with those who show genuine interest.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When one couple was asked what made them respond so readily to the witness given, they answered: “It was in the Bible.” Yes, God’s Word reaches hearts. (Heb. 4:12) Refer to it often, making liberal use of texts in the paragraphs. Help the student to see why a particular course is wise or foolish. Reason with him on how obedience to God’s laws will benefit him. —See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> August 1, 1984, pages 15-16.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Many publishers have found that using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book is very effective in highlighting the Bible. For example, when considering page 124, paragraph 13, of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font11">book, a householder may ask why his clergyman says that children die because God wants them to be with him in heaven. A consideration of the material on page 99 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font11">book under “Why do babies die?&quot; emphasizes Jehovah’s interest in preserving the family arrangement.

After cbnsidefing paragraph 2, haV6 experienced pioneers or publishers demonstrate how to offer a subscription to a person who shows genuine interest in the Kingdom message. If the person would like to receive the magazine(s) regularly, we will be pleased to write up a subscription so he can receive the magazines in the mail. Explain how our work is supported by voluntary donations. If he does not want to make a donation, we can encourage him to benefit from reading the magazines and offer to return and discuss further encouraging Scriptural information. Chairman points out the need to be discerning when offering the subscription. It is not necessary to mention that the magazines can be obtained for a specific period of time, such as one year. A six-month subscription should build the person’s appreciation for the Kingdom message published in the magazine and help us determine if he is truly interested. After paragraphs 3 and 4, have two enthusiastic publishers consider how they are going to apply these suggestions during October and in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The school will begin with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or by a qualified ministerial servant. It will be based on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” </span><span class="font11">1990 Edition. This assignment should be delivered as a 10-to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the section. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font11"> of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. Where needed, a theme should be selected. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder or by a ministerial servant assigned by the school overseer. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font11"> overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font11"> the information is of value to us. Check </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> issues for further highlight material. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">All </span><span class="font11">the assigned verses should actually be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to sisters. It will be based on the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font11"> The student assigned should be able to read. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. It is preferred that settings involve field service or informal witnessing. The one giving the talk may either Initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistants) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned to a brother or a sister. The subjects for this talk will alternate between the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font11"> books, the latter to be mainly assigned to young or new students. The student assigned should be able to read. When assigned to a brother, this should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the brother to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable audience-type setting, the brother may choose to develop his talk accordingly. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">S-38 10/90</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student speaker merits solely a “G” and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G,” “I,&quot; or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student’s next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those giving talks should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows after the giving of necessary oral counsel, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than a total of two minutes for counsel and remarks after each student talk. If the Bible highlights presentation left something to be desired, private counsel may be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">PREPARING TALKS: Brothers giving Assignment No. 1 should select a theme where needed. Students assigned the second talk should choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material. Students assigned the third and fourth talks should use the theme shown. Prior to giving the talk, students will want to read over the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font11"> material dealing with the speech quality being worked on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Talks No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The one assigned to give the &quot;stop signal” should do so promptly. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Check the questions provided in the April, August, and December issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> but do not write on the question sheet prior to taking the review. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own answers. The school overseer will read off the answers and concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 50 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Of course, unbaptized persons whose lives conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ABSENTEES: All in the congregation can show appreciation for this school by endeavoring to be present at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font11"> is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. It</span><span class="font11"> a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> With so many demands on their time, parents face a challenge in building a family that is steadfast in true worship. Christian families need a close bond that provides support during present difficult times. (Eccl. 4:9-12; 2 Tim. 3:1-5) As spirituality grows, a family becomes more united and will be strengthened to withstand the onslaughts of Satan and his system.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BUILDING SPIRITUAL QUALITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Congregation meetings and family Bible study are essentials in the family’s weekly schedule. (Deut. 6: 6, 7; Heb. 10:23-25; w86 11/1 pp. 23-5) Yet, more is needed. There is still a void if this is all the spiritual training children get.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A wholesome family relationship develops when parents take a genuine interest in the spiritual welfare of the children. In Israel, parents were responsible for the education and training of their children, instructing them by both word and example. The Israelite educational program included practical training for adult living, teaching of basic reading and writing skills, and instruction to develop spiritual qualities. In educating children, emphasis was placed on teaching them the fear of Jehovah, the Law, respect for parents and older persons, and the importance of obedience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Strive to spend quality time with your family every day. Spiritual matters can be discussed in an informal setting, such as at mealtimes. One parent wisely observed: “Parents will spend time with their children—either in developing spiritual qualities</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">• What factors should be kept in mind when two or more different-language congregations work the same territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The March 1984 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> under “Presenting the Good News,&quot; stated: “The publishers of each congregation should concentrate their efforts on their own particular language group.” This is because congregation territory assignments in multilingual areas are according to language. Congregations working multilanguage territory may find it helpful to make a list of homes and apartments where their publishers should not call. It is the responsibility of the service overseers of the concerned congregations to work out a mutually acceptable system for working the territory thoroughly and directing interested ones to the appropriate congregation. This should be done to prevent householders from or in helping them get out of one problem after another.” How much better it is to build the needed spiritual qualities in children so they can avoid the world’s pitfalls!—1 Cor. 3:10-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ENJOYING FIELD SERVICE ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Joy is an emotion excited by the acquisition or expectation of good. When a person is prepared for field service, he may properly anticipate good results. Thus, preparation is the key to joyful field service. Regularly practicing what to say as a family before going into the field service builds confidence. (Compare Titus 3:1b.) Each one can have a goal in mind. A simple presentation can be rehearsed with young children or those just starting in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> By working with their children in the Christian ministry, parents can help them cultivate the personal interest in people exemplified by Jehovah and Jesus. The ministry also helps us to develop a close relationship with Jehovah. (w81 11/1 pp. 14-20) Some families schedule full days together, planning wholesome recreation following field service. This allows time for conversation in a relaxed atmosphere and draws parents and children together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Be determined to develop the needed communication skills in order to keep a close relationship with your children. Do not allow anything to prevent you from taking the necessary time to strengthen your family spiritually. Pray for and with your children, knowing that Jehovah can crown your building efforts with success.—Ps. 127:1; Prov. 24:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">being unnecessarily disturbed by publishers of different-language congregations, perhaps during the same morning or afternoon. We do not want to “offer any hindrance to the good news about the Christ.”—1 Cor. 9:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When adjustments need to be made because of people moving, quickly pass on names and addresses of interested persons to the appropriate congregation. This will assist in keeping the territory records up-to-date. Love, mutual concern, understanding, reasonableness, and cooperation are vital.—Phil. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When participating in street work, informal witnessing, and so forth, publishers may carry literature in various languages. However, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">when going from house to house,</span><span class="font11"> we would normally not offer literature in languages other than that of our congregation.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Conversing With People</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> According to a dictionary, conversation is an “oral exchange of sentiments, observations, opinions, or ideas.&quot; But how can you start agcn-versation basBtl on the Bible </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">when </span><span class="font11">the people you meet may be religiously oppos.edtpr are occupied, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">w</span><span class="font11">i</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">th th</span><span class="font11">eir own affairs?

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We should earnestly pr</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ay to God </span><span class="font11">to help us find honesthearted people and open the way for us to converse with them.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">USE WHAT WE HAVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book_offers many excellent introductions on pages 9-15. Most of these make effective use of questions. When the householder responds to a question, </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">listen</span><span class="font11"> respectfully and then reply in a manner that will show the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">KOtlSEholder we have </span><span class="font11">considered what he has said.—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■' Of course, when you ask a question, you do not know how the householder will answer. Be ready to adj just your discussion accordingly. Try to keep the conversation going By introducing further information from the Bible dealing with his interests and by asking further thoughtful questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE IN ADVANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You may already be acquainted with the general thinking of people in your territory.

<p><span class="font11">information may convince the person of Jehovah’s love for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ASK QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Effective use of questions helped Jesus get people to think and reason. (Matt. 17:24-27) The student’s answers may help us to determine what he is learning as well as what unscriptural views he may still hold. Perhaps the student is battling a smoking habit. You have reviewed the material in chapter 27 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book and the information on pages 13-16 in the July 8,1989, issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> He sees the need to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Topic for Conversation may be just what you need. Begin your </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">conversa</span><span class="font11">tion with-things thai-you believe-are of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">concern to the householde</span><span class="font11">r, briefly presentthe problem, and then lead into the Bible sol</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">utio</span><span class="font11">n. When he makes an observation, comment positively, not critically, on what he says. Your interesfTn his thoughts and feelings should encourage him to continue conversing with you. Try to find points of agreement and comment on these. Keep the conversation positive by emphasizing Kingdom blessings as the Bible’s solution for man’s problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Consider differing viewpoints as keys to coriHnuea conversation. IT the householder is willing to reason, you might ask, “Did you ever </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">think of </span><span class="font11">it from this standpoint?” Then point to what God’s Word says on the subject. If you find that the person is unreasonable, d_o n</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot insist that he </span><span class="font11">accept what you have said. Rather, conclude with </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">a friendly comment</span><span class="font11">, leaving theway_opon for a future opportunity to present the good news to him.—Prov. 12:8,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Some people are more in</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">clined</span><span class="font11"> to converse whe</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">n you meet them infor</span><span class="font11">mally. Do not hesitate to start conversations with people </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">you meet on </span><span class="font11">the s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">treet</span><span class="font11"> or who are working or relaxing in their, </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">yard</span><span class="font11">. They may welcome your genuine interest in their activity, and you may be able to lead the conversation into a discussion of the Bible promise that the earth will soon be a paradise. When you start a conversation, try to make it </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">a ple</span><span class="font11">asant experience for the householder. Insofar as it depends on you, leave the person with a more favorable-attitude toward God, his Word, and his servants. In this way, even if you are not successful initially in reaching hisTieart, &quot;he mayUFTnore </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">receptiv</span><span class="font11">e the next timers Witness calls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A word of caution, though. At times such questions may bring answers that surprise or disappoint you. What then? If it is a sensitive subject, it may be better not to force the issue but to say: “Let’s go on for now. We can come back to this later.” Or “Well, it is something to think about, isn’t it?” (John 16:12) Knowing how the student really feels about the matter, you can prepare information that may</span></p>

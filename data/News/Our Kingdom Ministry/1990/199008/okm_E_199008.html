<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Zealous in Spreading the Kingdom Message</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is a God of fine works, and he is zealous in getting them accomplished. Everything he does is for the good of those serving him. Jesus set a fine example in imitating his Father’s zeal’. On one occasion, zeal for Jehovah’s house motivated him to rid the temple of those who were turning it into a house of merchandise. (John 2:14-17) We too </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">must demonstrate zea</span><span class="font14">l in our service tcT Jehovah God if we want to be identified as a people “zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The fine works of Christians benefit others. The most beneficial thing we can do for another person is to help him to know and serve Jehovah. (John 17:3) We extend such help through our zealous Kingdompreaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> What is zeal? </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Zeal is</span><span class="font14"> a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rdor</span><span class="font14">. Christian zeal stems from an earnes</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">t de-</span><span class="font14">sire to do what is right and ..proper. </span><span class="font13">The Greek word for “zeal&quot; means “to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">boil</span><span class="font14">.” As ministers ot God',“we should express this quality as we spread the Kingdom message. Are we zealous in the ministry? Are we doing all we.can to help others learn about Jehovah’s purposes?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why You Should Want to Conduct a Bible Study</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> One of the most rewarding experi-ences for a ChristiarTis to be us</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecbby </span><span class="font14">Jehovahto-help someone else become a disciple of Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Cor. 3:6,9) For those we help in this way, it can mean everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> A very close relationship develops between the teacher and the one being t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">aug</span><span class="font14">ht. The spiritual growth of the student is indeed a source of great joy. (1 Thess. 2:11,19,20) Therefore, it should be the goal of each Christian to cond</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">uc</span><span class="font14">t </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">at feast one hom</span><span class="font14">e Bible study with someone outside of his own household. Of course, it is the responsibility of each family head to conduct a meaningful, regular Bible study with his own family. In those households where the father </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">is not a </span><span class="font14">believer, the Christian mother wijj need to. make approp</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">riate ar</span><span class="font14">rangem</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ents</span><span class="font14"> for studying the Bible with the children.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAY FOR STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Since we are so far along in this time of the end, all should put forth efforts to conduct eff</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ective Bible </span><span class="font14">studigs. Regular prayer to Jehovah in this regard demonstrates our sincere desire to conduct a Bible study. It shows that we see the life-and-death issue involved. (Ezek. 33:7-9, 14-16) We may be assured of Jehovah’s</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> During the month of August, we will again have the privilege of offering any of the 32-page brochures except </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">School and Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font14"> We may offer </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever.', “Look!

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Keep Bearing Fruit With Endurance</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> When writing to the congregation in Colossae, less than 30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the apostle Paul could say that the truth of the good news was bearing fruit and increasing in all the world. (Col. 1:5, 6) On a much grander scale today, Jehovah’s Witnesses hav</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">e liter</span><span class="font15">ally </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">reached</span><span class="font15"> “the most distant part of the earth” with the good news of the Kingdom. (Acts 1:8; John 14:12) During the 1989 service year, there was a 5.6-percent increase in the average number of Kingdom publishers worldwide, and we reached a new peak of 3,787,188 publishers in 212 co</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">untrie</span><span class="font15">s!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> In countries where preaching about God’s Kingdom is banned and reports are incomplete, an even greater increase of </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">7.6 percent</span><span class="font15"> was reported! Despite the many problems that exist in those lands, the publishers continue to “bear fruit </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">with endurance</span><span class="font15">.” (Luke 8:15) In some places the pressures have lessened, but difficult conditions continue unchanged in other countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> In countries where there is greater freedom to carry on Kingdom-preaching activities, we face different problems. M</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">uch apathy and indifferenc</span><span class="font15">e is encountered, especially where there is material prosperity. Jehovah’s servants must be on guard not to adopt such attitudes. We do not want material interests, pleasures, recreation, and other distractions to encroach on our theocratic activities. Otherwise we could become indifferent and fail to appreciate the need to keep bearing fruit with endurance.—Luke 21:34-36.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ENDURANCE AND EXERTION NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Endurance is a requirement whether we face opposition to the good news or have relative freedom to carry out our Christian responsibilities. In some lands, our brothers have been working under adverse conditions for decades. Their endurance under such adversity has worked out an approved condition, and they are now reaping </span><span class="font14">rich blessings. (Rom. 5:3-5; Gal. 6:9) Whatever </span><span class="font15">difficulties we may encounter, we want to keep on enduring. The Ki</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ngdom witness must be given</span><span class="font15">, and all of us must continue to demonstrate our integrity. By endurance on our part, we will secure our soul, or life.—Mark 13:10; Luke 21:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> We can demonstrate that we do not take spiritual things for granted by exerting ourselves vigorously in Jehovah’s service, not tiring out in the preaching work. In some land's where transportation is more difficult, where material necessities are lac</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">king</span><span class="font15">, and where there are economic pro</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">blem</span><span class="font15">s, there is no letup in preaching the good news. In a few such countries, congregation publishers regularly average 14 to 17 hours in field service each month. Their pio</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">neer rank</span><span class="font15">s are steadily in</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">creasing</span><span class="font15"> too. It makes those of us who have many material conveniences stop and think. Can we increase our regular share<sup>-</sup> in the~all-important Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking work?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN WE DO MORE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Spending more time in field service may require adjusting our schedules slightly. If we have been spending an hour in the field ministry on Sunday, could we perhaps lengthen that time by s</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">pending another hour m</span><span class="font15">aking return visits or conducting a Bible study? Or if we conduct a Bible study, could we include an hour or so of house-to-house service or make a few return visits before the study? On Sa</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">turda</span><span class="font15">y after spending two hours in magazine activity, perhaps we could deliver magazines on a magazine route we have developed or try to make a few return visits. Those who live in an urban area may find it convenient to spend some time in street witnessing. In these or other ways, we may be able to increase our participation in the field service. Good results should increase proportionately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> More time in the field service making return visits would no doubt result in more Bible studies being conducted. In time this will mean more people coming into the truth and helping us to accomplish the Kingdom-preaching work.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAYER ESSENTIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> If we are to keep bearing fruit with endurance, we must seek Jehovah’s blessing and yield to the direction of his spirit. We must make our m</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">inistry a matter of prayer to Jehovah</span><span class="font15">. When praying to Jehovah about our field activity, we are reminded that we are his fellow workers. (1 Cor. 3:9) With Jehovah’s help, we can endure in our ministry even when we do not see immediate results. In some areas, increase has come only after many years of faithful endurance on the part of Kingdom proclaimers. As we look to the future, it is necessary always to seek divine guidance and help in order not to give up but to accomplish our ministry fully. (2 Tim. 4:5) There is still much fruitage being produced in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> Jesus stres</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">sed the nee</span><span class="font15">d fo</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">r us always to pray&gt; </span><span class="font15">(Luke 18:1) </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Paul exhorte</span><span class="font15">d\ “Pray incessantly.7 (1 Thess. 5:17) There are urgent reasons for us to persevere in prayer now. Many responsibilities are involved in caring for the gro</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">wing flock</span><span class="font15"> year by year. We want to help others to bear fruit with endurance. Attention must be given to the various needs of individual publishers and of the organization as a whole. Seeing the need for donations to support the work and to make continued publication of Bible-based literature possible, we want to pray that Jehovah will keep on motivating God-fearing people to be generous in this regard.—2 Cor. 9:8-11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1( 1</sup> As portions of the worldwide field open up for theocratic development to a greater extent than ever before, the Scriptural exhortation at Colos-sia</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ns 4:2</span><span class="font15"> becomes more meaningful: “Be persevering in prayer, remaining awake'un it with thanksgiving.’’ Our prayers should be i</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">n behalf o</span><span class="font15">f our brothers everywhere that they continue to bear fruit, helping other sheeplike ones found in territories where witnessing has been more difficult in the past.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">MANIFEST THANKFULNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> How thankful we are for the abundant spiritual provisions we so much enjoy! We want to thank Jehovah for these, and we also pray for his continued blessing on the work of the faithful slave and its Governing Body. Their humble, unti</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ring efforts i</span><span class="font15">n our behalf and in behalfof sheeplike ones around the world are very much appreciated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>12</sup> In sowing Kingdom seed, a tremendous amount </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">of literature has been placed</span><span class="font15">. (Matt.TK: 3-8, 18-23) Yet, there is a contin</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">uing deman</span><span class="font15">d for Bibles and Bible literature in the field. The world report indicates that a great deal of cultivating and watering in the form of return visits and home Bible studies has been done. As we continue to do our part in these important features of our ministry, we thank Jehovah for his continued blessing that makes things grow. Indeed, we pray for that blessing.—1 Cor. 3:6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER NEEDS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>13</sup> Because of being in the world though no part of it, Christians will continue to face tests and trials, and these will yet intensify in these last days. Some now are enduring persecution or other difficulties. Others must carry on their Christian activities in war-torn lands. Our brothers have experienced di</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">saster</span><span class="font15">s such as earthquakes, typhoons, and hurricanes. When this happens, we should pray for our brothers in such locations. (Compare Acts 12:5; 2 Corinthians 1:11.) Sometimes it becomes necessary to approach or write to jefficials in high stations about bans on our work, persecution of our brothers, or other matters affecting Kingdom interests. Under such circumstances, we do what we can per</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">sonall</span><span class="font15">y, and we offer prayer concerning these individuals that they may be favorably disposed toward our fellow servants.—1 Tim. 2:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>14</sup> There are many pressures brought upon families living in Satan’s wicked world. (2 Cor. 4:4) Married couples may be confronted with serious problems. They should be encouraged to pray,for divine guidance, and we also may pray in their behalf. (1 Cor. 7:5; 1 Pet. 3:7) Family heads should appreciate that Jehovah will </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">liste</span><span class="font15">n to their sincere prayers for direction in presiding well over their households. (Judg. 13:8; Phil. 4:6, 7) Young as well as old are faced with trying situations. This may be at </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">schoo</span><span class="font15">l, on the secular job, when traveling, or in other circumstances. Prayer helps us to resist the spirit of this wicked world and to keep bearing fruit as we continue doing what is pleasing in God’s sight.—Matt. 6:13; Eph. 6:13-18; 1 John 3:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>15</sup> Jehovah is the great Hearer of prayer. (Ps. 65:2) At all times we need to cast our anxieties upon him. (Ps. 55:22) We have opportunities to show our concern by means of prayer for all the Kingdom interests and for the welfare of our brothers everywhere. When reflecting on the work of those taking the lead in the congregation and those directing the worldwide expansion program, when dealing with those who_are s</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">piritua</span><span class="font15">lly sick^or when caring for other problems small or great, all of us should ke</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ep such matter</span><span class="font15">s befor</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">e Jehovah</span><span class="font15"> in prayer. (1 Thess. 5:25; Jas. 5: 14-16) Yes, our anxieties should be cast upon Jehovah with full confidence that no matter what it is we ask in harmony with his will, he will hear us. (1 Pet. 5:7; 1 John 5:14) May we be zealous in Kingdom service and continually look to Jehovah to help us keep bearing fruit with endurance.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In 1983 the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font14"> brochure was provided especially for Christian parents and their school-age children. It is designed to help clearly present to teachers and administrators the beliefs and practices of Jehovah’s Witnesses as these relate to certain school activities. It also provides guidelines as to the unified position of Jehovah’s Witnesses with respect to moral conduct.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> For many youths this brochure has proved to be a real protection. For example, a Witness parent learned</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">• Why should we give special attention to our dress and grooming when visiting Brooklyn Bethel, Watchtower Farms, and all branch facilities throughout the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Christians are expected to maintain proper decorum. Our dress and grooming at all times should reflect the decency and dignity that befit servants of Jehovah God. This is especially true when visiting Brooklyn Bethel, Watchtower Farms, and branch offices and facilities around the world. In discussing the importance of proper dress and grooming, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry</span><span class="font14"> comments on the need for physical cleanness and modest dress and grooming when engaging in the field ministry and attending Christian meetings. Then, on page 131, paragraph 2, it states: “The same would apply when visiting the Bethel home at‘Brooklyn or any oFthe society’s branch offices. Remember, the name Bethel means ‘House of God,' so our dress, grooming and conduct should be similar to what is expected of us when attending meetings for worship at the Kingdom Hall.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The apostle Paul said that we are “a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.” (1 Cor. 4:9) Therefore, our dress and grooming that sex education lectures were to be given to the students by people known to be of loose morals. With the brochure in hand, the parent was able to discuss her Scriptural objections and succeeded in having appropriate changes made in her daughter’s classes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Before</span><span class="font14"> school begins, parents can fortify the minds and hearts of their children by taking time to refresh their memories on the contents of the brochure. With due consideration to the children’s particular age, grade, and school, parents can emphasize choice points from the brochure that might be especially helpful during the year. (Prov. 14:15; 22:3) Rehearse with your child situations that might confront him, and demonstrate how the published material can be of benefit in ‘making straight paths for his feet.’—Heb. 12:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Parents can do much to help their children “make a defense before everyone” who might question them as to their personal views and hopes. (1 Pet. 3:15) In some cases parents may choose to talk personally with the teacher. Some Christian parents </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. SI </span><span class="font14">should have a positive influence on others as to how they view the true worship of Jehovah. However, it has been noted that some brothers and sisters, when visiting the Society’s branches, te</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd to be extremely casu</span><span class="font14"></span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">al in their'dress.</span><span class="font14"> Such dress is not appropriate when visiting the branch facilities. In this matter, as in all other aspects of our Christian life, we desire to maintain the same high standards that distinguish God’s people as different from the world by doing all things for God’s glory. (Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 10:31) It is also good to speak with our Bible students and others who may be visiting Brooklyn Bethel or any of the Society's branch offices for the first time to remind them of the importance of giving attention to proper dress and grooming.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">So when visiting the Society’s facilities, ask yourself: ‘Is my dress and grooming modest? (Mic. 6:8) Does it reflect well on the God that I worship? Would others be distracted or offended by my appearance? Am I setting the proper example for others who may be visiting for the first time?’ May we always, by our dress and grooming, “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By Making Opportunities to Give an Informal Witness</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus instructed his disciples to let their light shine. (Matt. J:|4J6) He wanted them to tell others'about the good news OT God’s Kingdom on every appropriate occasion. In this regard, Jesus was a model.&quot;An example of this was when he seized the opportunity to speak the truth, to a Samaritan woman at a well in Sychar. (John 4:5-30) What about us? </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Do we </span><span class="font14">make such opportunities to give a witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Not all of us can engage in the field service every day. But there may be occasions nearly every day when we can give a witness; In what way? By informal witnessing. Many thousands have become acquainted with the truth in this way. If we are alert to recognize the opportunities and then make the effort, many more people can be reached.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO WHOM CAN WE PREACH?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In addition to formal house-to-house witnessing, return visits, and Bible studies, we can witness to our workmates, schoolmates, business associates, relaHves, and other acquaintances on an informal basis. When traveling by. bus, Xrain,-or airplane, we may be able to strike up a conversation with fellow travelers. While on vacation, we might share the good&quot; news with hotel and motel personnel, service Station attendants, restaurant workers, and taxi drivers. We could talk to others while waiting at a doctor’s office or public laundry? While at tane.we can perhaps witness to neighbors, sa</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">lesme</span><span class="font14">n, or deliverymen. Even if we are hospitalized, we can witness to doctors, nurses, and other </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">pafien</span><span class="font14">ts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO GET STARTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> If we have an appointment and know we will have to spend some time</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Study &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> During the past four service years, 959,834 persons have been baptized worldwide, and 172,659 of these were in the congregations in the United States. The vast majority of these people reached the poinLoi baptism with the help-odsomeone-conducting a Bible study with them. Attendance at the Memorial and at our district conventions indicates there are many more who may be helped to progress to baptism. By continuing our efforts to start and conduct Bible studies with such ones, we may be able to help many more to become disciples and eventually enjoy everlasting life. —1 Tim. 6:12,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">waiting, we could take along the latest magazines and be prepared to discuss an article of interest with someone we meet Or we could use a tract or brochure as a basis for starting a conversation. In such a setting, some have found it effective to begin the conversation by making a* striking statement based on a current event and then asking for the person's reaction. Others have found that asking a thought-provoking question regarding some current event can lead into a fine witness. In all cases, initiative is what is needed to make things happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSING AT WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Those who have secular jobs can make opportunities to witness to workmates. Two sisters in Georgia made a list of fellow workers they thought might be interested in the truth. By talking wit</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">h thos</span><span class="font14">e on the list and a few others, they were able to place over 65 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Rev</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">elat</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">ion Cli</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">max</span><span class="font14"> b</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ooks</span><span class="font14"> and cultivate much interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> In another case, a brother resolved that he would witness to the first person wh</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o sat down next to hi</span><span class="font14">m during his 15-minute break at work. The man to whom he spoke knew about the truth but said that h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e did </span><span class="font14">not want to pursue the matter.

Within six months That man and his family were all baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> As “the light of the world,” Jesus made opportunities to give an informal witness. (John 8:12) If we are </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">algrt</span><span class="font14"> and willing to share our Biblebased hope, we too will not miss opportunities to give a witness. Thus, like Jesus’ disciples, we will ‘shine as illuminators in the world.’—Phil. 2: 15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Return to School &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d}</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">schedule periodic visits to the school, as this can help to create a good relationship between them and the teachers. Such personal interest also strengthens the relationship between parent and child. Some parents have heeded the suggestion to take time even to sit in on the classroom discussions where this is allowed. Sometimes this gives the parent a real feel for the environment and unique dayto-day pressures our children face. —1 Pet. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BE A WITNESS EVERY DAY</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Become Holy in All Your Conduct</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Just as in the past, holiness is a divine requirement for God’s servants today. A pressing need thus exists for each df us to understand clearly not only what holiness is but also how and why it should characterize our worship of Jehovah. To this end, “Become Holy in All Your Conduct&quot; is the theme discussed in the special assembly day program for the 1991 service year.—1 Pet. 1:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Since Jehovah’s righteous principles and laws originate with him as the Holy God, the righteous standing we enjoy is a direct result of our close, personal relationship with him. Consequently, the program will develop a number of ways to show how we can improve our relationship with God. These involve obedience to his holy standards, even in what might be considered little things. (Luke 16:10) We will be helped to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Jehovah's holy requirements and be reminded why these should influence all our thinking, attitudes, and ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Two principal discourses to be developed will be “Submitting to Being Progressively Cleansed” and “Expanding Activities of Jehovah’s Holy People.” As exciting world happenings daily impress upon our minds the urgency of our times, the special assembly day program for the new service year will motivate us to continue looking to Jehovah for direction and seeking to be well pleasing to him by conducting ourselves in holiness. —1 Pet. 1:14,16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> It is true that the new school year brings moments of apprehension and anxiety. However, a positive view along with diligent preparation will help both parents and youths to ‘brace up their minds for activity’ to Jehovah’s praise during the coming school year.—1 Pet. 1:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A VERSATILE PROVISION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> When the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font13"> was re</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">leased</span><span class="font13"> in 1950, we found the cross-references, footnotes, appendix^ and chatrr references~io be very helpful in our ministry, in preparing for congregation meetings, and in general personal study. Then, i</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">q, 1984</span><span class="font13">, how thrilled we were to receive&quot; the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation Reference Bible!</span><span class="font13"> What a superb provision to assist us in our effort to become skilled workers who use God’s Word aright!

For example, “Who Will Lead Mankind to Peace?” and “World Peace—What Will It Really Mean?” are the subjects of the April 1 and April 15 issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> Few people know the correct answers to these questions. But Jehovah has not left us in doubt. (Amos 3:7) Surely, millions of honesthearted ones would also like to have a truthful answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font13"> issues for April and May will include the subjects “What Prospects for Longer Life?,” “A Clean Earth—Will You Live to See It?,” and “A World Without Guns—Is It Possible?” Do you agree that people in your territory should have the opportunity to read these issues?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASED PARTICIPATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We should plan now to participate fully in the distribution of all these outstanding issues coming in April and May.

When this happens, you can look up the scripture in your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font13">with cross-references .and find five scriptures referenced on the word “rock-mass.” These scriptures show that Christ, rather than Peter, is the Foundation of the congregation. By consulting the same text in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation Reference Bible, </span><span class="font13">you will find additional information in the footnote on the word “rockmass,” explaining its meaning in the original Greek.</span></p></li>

To'begin with, we should read </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">the magazines thor</span><span class="font13">oughly. Th’e more familiar we are with the magazines, the greater our zeal will be in offering them. While reading, we should try to find points to highlight in various articles. What is there in each article that might appeal to certain types of people? We can ask ourselves: ‘Who would especially appreciate these articles? What would appeal to a neighbor, an acquaintance, a businessperson, a student, and so forth?’ To be truly effective, we should be able to make a personal recommendation of the magazines based on our knowledge and enjoyment of the timely articles.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SET A PERSONAL GOAL</span></p>

Where this has been done, the benefits have been many. Such study has contributed to a spirit of love and peace within the family circle. Children have progressed to the point of becoming dedicated servants of Jehovah, have exerted a positive influence on the local congregation, and often have entered full-time service.

While the world appeals to the desire for material things, Jehovah entreats us to be content with the really important things.—1 Tim. 6:8; Phil. 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> This is especially a challenge to Christian youths who want to take Jehovah’s commands seriously. They may be pressured by their teachers and their peers at school who consider higher education essential to success in life. While recognizing they have material needs, many Christian youths wisely resist such pressure and choose the pioneer ministry as their career. Trusting in Jehovah’s promises, they look to him to care for their needs.—Ps. 62:2; 68:19; ITim. 5:8; 6:9, 10.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> of November 15, 1982, encouraged each one of us to ask: “Can I really justify before Jehovah the fact that I am not a pioneer?” Obviously, many were not then in a position to pioneer. But they did not become discouraged, knowing that wholehearted service in any amount is always acceptable to Jehovah. (Mic. 6:8; 2 Cor. 8:12) Later, as personal circumstances changed, prayerful reconsideration of that 1982 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> article has enabled some to be among the thousands of individuals who have more recently taken up the regular pioneer service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> The foreword on petfee'5 gives convincing evidence to show that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font13"> is a scholarly work. The appendix provides a clear explanation of </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">why t</span><span class="font13">he use of the divine name is appropriate. It ment was printed in 1982, have your circumstances changed? In the United States, over 17,000 pioneer applications were processed last year! No doubt many of these applicants wanted to become pioneers earlier but had to wait for a change in circumstances.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> In some cases, the necessary change may have to do with one’s mental attitude about pioneer service. Or it may simply involve making a good schedule for service. At times a change in personal responsibilities and obligations is needed for opening the way to pioneer service. Therefore, it is good to make this a regular matter of prayer to Jehovah along with an honest evaluation of ourselves and our circumstances. Thousands have done so and are now enjoying the blessings of pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If a frank appraisal of your circumstances indicates you may be one who could begin pioneering in the not-too-distant future, why not start auxiliary pioneer service on a continuing basis now? Within a few months, you will likely develop return visits and Bible studies. This can aid you in making a smooth transition to the regular pioneer service, possibly before the beginning of the new service year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah is accomplishing great things in the last days of the present wicked system. Now is the time for all of us to draw close to him and to bless his name “all day long.&quot; (Ps. 145:2; Jas. 4:8) If your circumstances allow you to do so and you qualify, let pioneer service be another evidence of your trust in Jehovah. —Ps. 94:18.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Truly, Jehovah has provided what we need to be “completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:17) By using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font13"> along with the Bible publications we will be offering, we can effectively d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">o the work as</span><span class="font13">signed. (Luke6:47, 48) As we prove to be skilled workmen, using God’s Word aright, we can confidently expect the Master to say: “Well done”! —Matt. 25:21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In his letter to a fellow evangeliz-er, the apostle Paul wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”—2 Tim. 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As modern-day proclaimers of the good news, we believe this statement with all our heart. We accept the Bible as God’s inspired Word. We welcome its guidance in every aspect of our lives. (Ps. 119:105; John 17:17) But how can we help others to accept the Bible as God’s Word and apply its principles in their daily living?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As we share in the first public distribution of the new book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font13"> during the month of March, we will be building confidence in the Bible and helping people see the benefits of living according to its inspired counsel. What a privilege this will be!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What can we say when offering the book? After a friendly greeting, we might call attention to Proverbs 14:12 to show that successful living requires wise direction. Wrong direction can be calamitous. Then read Proverbs 2:6, 7 to show that Jehovah provides true wisdom. We could reason with the householder regarding the need to turn to the Bible to find godly wisdom. Then we could say: “This publication shows that the Bible is a reliable source of sound advice on problems people face. Please note what is stated here in paragraph 2 on page 5. [Read paragraph 2, and if</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">• How</span><span class="font13"> can we display Christian manners when attending the Congregation Book Study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are usually observed by our neighbors, and they will at times comment on and even react to our conduct. (Compare 1 Corinthians 4:9.) As Jehovah’s servants, we want their comments and reactions to our behavior to be favorable. (1 Pet. 2:12) This is true in connection with our activity at the Congregation Book Study. Since the majority of these are held in private homes, special care must be exercised so that our manners reflect well on everything we do. Where parking is limited, why not make arrangements to carpool so as to prevent undue irritation to those in the neighborhood of the book study? Our love for our neighbor will make us refrain from inconsiderately parking our car in a way that could cause him inconvenience or distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">time permits, read paragraph 4. ] This publication will help you appreciate that the Bible is indeed God’s Word and that it contains practical guidance in all matters of life. This book is yours for a contribution of just $1.00.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> A householder may appear to be busy or say he is not interested, not wanting to get involved in a lengthy discussion. To make a brief presentation, you might say: “No doubt you would agree there are many problems facing mankind.” Then read the introductory paragraph of chapter 1. After the householder comments on the concluding question in that paragraph, you could say: “The Bible tells us that very soon now God himself will solve all mankind’s perplexing problems. This book gives powerful evidence to show that the Bible is true, since it is God’s Word and not man’s. I would like you to have it for a contribution of just $1.00.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FILLING THE NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> This new book, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?,</span><span class="font13"> will enable sincere readers to understand and appreciate that the Bible is truly God’s Word. Honestly considering what it says may start them off on the road to life. Therefore, make a special effort to place this book with as many people as you can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> All of us should have read the new book through before the March campaign begins. We will want to give the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font13"> book the widest distribution possible, featuring it in every aspect of the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">We are joyful whenever we meet, and this often results in animated conversation before and after the meeting. (Mic. 2:12) Good manners and consideration for others would dictate that the volume of our conversation be kept at a modest level. (Matt. 7:12; Gal. 6:10) Christian love would also impel us to restrain our children from running outside and from damaging other people’s property. (Prov. 29:15; 1 Cor. 13:4, 5) This would include respectful conduct in the home where the book study is conducted. If any improper conduct is observed, the elders should not delay in giving loving and firm counsel so that problems do not arise that could result in complaints from neighbors, difficulties for the householder who has hospitably opened his home for the study, or inconvenience for those attending a particular book study location.</span></p>

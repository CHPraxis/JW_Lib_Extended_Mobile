<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> As we preach from house to house, on the streets, and informally, we sometimes meet people who profess a non-Christian religion. If we have only a scanty knowledge of their religious background, If may be difficult for us to give an effective witness about God’s Kingdom. Now, wifh’The new publication </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God,</span><span class="font14"> we can get insight into the world’s major religions and better understand the beliefs of these people. We can be equipped to help as many as possible to come “out from the snare of the Devil.&quot;—2 Tim. 2:24-26; Titus 3:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In the course of our ministry, some people will identify themselves as Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, or as a member of some other major religious group. We can kindly acknowledge this fact and perhaps sayt “It is interesting to meet people’ of many different religions. Mankind’s search for God has taken many different directions. [Here, according to the circumstances, one can use the text(s) from the Topic for Conversation.] But do you not agree that generally people profess the religion of their parents, rather than search for God themselves? In other words, they were born into a certain religion. That is a point made in the first chapter of this book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.</span><span class="font14"> [Show page 8, paragraph 12.] Learning more about other religions can be interesting. This book explains the origin, practices, and teachings of the major religions of the world.&quot;/Then flip through the pages to show some illustrations on the religion professed by the householder. Explain briefly that you are a volunteer worker and that the book is published as part of a worldwide effort to help sincere people in their search for God. If the person shows genuine interest, encourage him to accept and read the book.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> One of the most important activities parents perform is teaching their children the truth. It is an </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">obligation </span><span class="font14">from Jehovah. (Deut. 6:6, 7) Children need direction and guidance to walk uprightly in an ungodly world. They nee</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">d to lea</span><span class="font14">rn </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">to lov</span><span class="font14">e Jehovah and the trut'hTffiirixrTfofermined to stick with it. The August 1, 1588, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> page 11, stated :(“De-sp</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ite a</span><span class="font14">ny </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">other obligations</span><span class="font14"> you have or the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">troubles</span><span class="font14"> vou face, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">spending tim%</span><span class="font14"> with your children needs to be given priority. The time spent together will allow you to inculcate the spiritual values that will safeguard the hearts of your children and set them on the right course.” 3</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> If families are to follow the guidelines given in God’s Word, time </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">must </span><span class="font14">be set aside regularly for family study, Family head?need to give pri-</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> When appropriate, explain also that this work is supported by voluntary donations, and make arrangements to return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Another approach might be. to go directly to the chapter that relates to the householder’s own religion. Certainly a Hindu will be attracted to the map of India found on page 123 and to the photos on pages 96 and 117. Occasionally we may meet a Sikh wearing a traditional turban. Pages 100-101 present a brief summary of that faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> A Muslim may be pleasantly surprised to see the sequence of pictures of Mecca and the Ka’bah on page 289 and the quotations from the Qur’an on page 288 and other pages. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bud</span><span class="font14">dhists in search of enlightenment might show interest in chapter 6 and its illustrations on pages 141 and 157. People of Chinese origin should appreciate chapter 7, on T</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">aoism </span><span class="font14">and Confucianism. The illustrations on pages 171 and 173 may arouse interest in the book! While many Japanese profess both Buddhism and Shintoism, they willidentify witKthe illustrations on pages 190 and </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">195 </span><span class="font14">in the chapter on “ShinTo—Japan’s Search for God.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> In many territories we meet those of the Jewish religion. Chapter 9<sub>i</sub>“Ju-daism—&quot;Searching for God Through Scripture and Tradition,” should spark their interest. They are usually, interested in ed</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ucation</span><span class="font14">, and thus the whole book will appeal to many. We</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDY MATERIAL AND METHODS</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> What should be studied? The family heacTIs in the best position to know what the family needs. He can inquire as to what the others think will be beneficial and~take their suggestions into consideration. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Flexibility </span><span class="font14">will make the family study practical and stimulating. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Many fami</span><span class="font14">lies choose to prepare-the weekly lesson in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> However, it may be necessary aT times to discuss specific </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">subjec</span><span class="font14">ts covering problems youths face in school.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> For anyone professing a religion of Christ</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">endom</span><span class="font14">, chapter 10 might be of interest.

How do we know that Jesus had God’s approval? The illustration on page 253 answers that question.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Obviously, in order to adapt our presentation to each individual, we need to know the cont</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ent</span><span class="font14">s of the book and be familiar With’th?&quot; sequence of the chapters and the illustrations. (For further suggestions refer to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the. ScriptureSj </span><span class="font14">pages 21-4.) Then we may be able to sow the seed of truth by a tactful presentation of this new book. (1 Cor. 9: 19-23; Col. 4:5, 6) Since the Bible is often quoted for comparison throughout the book, there is a good basis for starting Bible studies. A later article will suggest how we can make return visits so as to start studies with people of many faiths.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Your Role in Building for the Future</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Today Christians are continuing to care for a spiritual building work that Jesus started about 1,960 years, a</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">go when he began gathe</span><span class="font15">ring disciples. (Matt. 4:17; 7:24, 25, 28; John 7:46) Jehovah has blessed this work abundantly. (Prov. 10:22) As we go about announcing God’s Kingdom, we are also building to care for future increase.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> While many older Kingdom Halls must-be renovated, additional halls are needed to accommodate new congregations that are being formed. Last year congregations in the United States increased by 244. Both finances and volunteer workers are needed for the successful completion of these construction projects. The brothers’ commendable positive attitude toward filling this need is being richly rewarded.—Ps. 41:1; Prov. 19:17; Eccl. 11:1; Luke 14:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVING ASSISTANCE OFFERED BY MANY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> We display our love, for “the whole association of brothers” by contributing_to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. (1 Pet. 2:17) Contributions received in this branch have provided funds to build 766 new Kingdom </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hall</span><span class="font15">s, accommodating over 1,140 congregations. But the need </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">continues</span><span class="font15"> to grow as the ingathering work speeds up. So Jehovah is continuing to bless this arrangement, and the elders should make sure that the contribution box for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is clearly identified and available to all. The contributions received along with funds, from repayment of loans are used to construct new Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> The Society, together with all the congregations that are benefiting from the provision, expresses deep appreciation to the multitude of individuals and families who regularly contribute to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Many congregations have passed resolutions, to contribute to this fund. Some circuits have lovingly made similar resolutions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Are you skilled in a construction trade? If so, and if you are available to a</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ssist</span><span class="font15"> with Kingdom Hall construction, you can make this known to the local elders and the circuit overseer. Skilled volunteer workers are needed throughout the country. Additionally, under the direction of the Society-appointed Regional—Building-Committees, other spiritually qualified brothers are being trained, to do the required work so that more congregations can be assisted with their building projects.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROLE OF</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL BUILDING COMMITTEES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> The 66 Regional Building Committees give assist</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ance</span><span class="font15"> at all stages of planning and construction. These committees have Society-provided de-sign§_that lend themselves to rapid methods of construction. The brothers serving on the committees are experienced elders, and they can offer valuable suggestions for building modest and attractive Kingdom Halls as well as for saving time and money. Because of their experience, they can help local elders decide whether it would be better to remodel an existing Kingdom Hall or to build a new one, and they can help them determine before a purchase whether a proposed site for new construction is suitable. They can also help elders to estimate accurately construction costs and the market value of an existing Kingdom Hall that may be sold.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> Wettbefore</span><span class="font15"> purchasing property, it is wise to consult the Regional Building Committee. These committees are assigned to assist with Kingdom Hall construction in a designated area composed of several circuits, and they can help with property purchase. They have guidelines to help brothers avoid difficulties that could be encountered in acquiring pro</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">perty</span><span class="font15">. Each circuit overseer is advised of the name, address, and telephone number of the committee chairman and can share this information with the local elders when there is a need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> When selecting property for Kingdom Hall construction in a city having more than one congregation, the local elders should discuss—the matter with the Regional Buil</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ding Co</span><span class="font15">mmittee, the circuit overseer(s), the city overseer, and possibly the elders from nearby congregations. This may aid the local elders in choosing a site that will benefit the congregation(s) involved in the present project and possibly relieve overcrowded conditions in neighboring Kingdom Halls, while also allowing for future growth in the area. In urban areas, a single Kingdom Hall is often used by three or more congregations. Even in less densely populated areas, a location may be selected that can serve two or more congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>9</sup> Using guidelines provided by the Society, Regional Building Committees provide a valuable service as they assist local congregations with their remodeling and new construction projects. During construction, volunteers are scheduled for justJthe time they will actually be needed at the construction site so that they will not miss sharing in the meetings and field service activity of their congregation. One Regional Building Committee stated: “By our continued efforts to apply the Society^ guidelines, we have been helped to simplify and speed up the building procedures.” )</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> The organization and skills learned on these projects have been helpful in Assembly Hall construction and in assisting the brothers rebuild after natural disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo and the earthquake in northern California in 1989. A number of volunteers have been called to work temporarily at Bethel, some helping with the work now under way at Patterson^ New York. Others have joined the International Volunteer Construction Worker </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Program, h</span><span class="font15">elping with construction at branches throughout the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> All can display the fruitage of kindness in cooperating with those overseeing the construction activity. In this way the needed work is “fully </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">performedT'andj</span><span class="font15">d</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">one “with joy and not with sig</span><span class="font15">hing.” (Acts 14:26; Heb. 13:17) A Regional Building Committee in </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">Michigan</span><span class="font15"> was able to report: (J'The cooperation between the three congregations was exceptional. . . . The brothers all displayed spiritual maturity. They were aioy to work with. It was a project to remember.’*</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCING KINGDOM HALL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>12</sup> Arrangements for any needed financing should be </span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">made at the outse</span><span class="font15">t. (Luke 14:28-30) The elders shoul</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">d determine th</span><span class="font15">e congregation’s ability to. pay the costs involved by taking a survey to determine (1) how much will be contributed in a lump sum to assist with property purchase and construction costs, (2) how much can be loaned locally and, the length of time the funds will be available, and (3phow much the publishers have in mind contributing monthly to repay any needed loan in addition to caring for normal operating expenses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>13</sup> Thereafter, elders of congregations desiring financial assistance from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund should discuss their proposed project and financial requirements with the circuit overseer, who can assist them by advising the Society of their needs and the details of the project. After information has been sent to the Society by the circuit overseer, correspondence is sent directly to the congregations involved. Financial assistance is provided progressively as funds become available and according to the need.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAIN A ZEALOUS SPIRIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>14</sup> All are to be commended for their generosity in supporting the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Many expressions of appreciation are received from congregations that have been assisted. An “equalizing” is taking place among the congregations. (2 Cor. 8:14, 15) Four congregations in Oregon wrote: “How appreciative we are for such a fine program, and how thankful we are to all the many generous brothers who have contributed to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund . . . Truly, outstanding Christian love has been demonstrated in our behalf. Please accept our thanks for all your help iq making this Kingdom Hall project a success.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>15</sup> DUring the building of a new Kingdom Hall, enthusiasm, zeal, and a positive spirit contribute to the success of the project. The .same spirit should continue as we seek to bring many more persons to a knowledge of the truth and encourage them to meet with us at the Kingdom Hall. Such zeal is a manifest expression of appre</span><span class="font15" style="text-decoration:underline;">ciati</span><span class="font15">on that results in marked increases in meeting attendance and in the overall growth of the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>16</sup> As we continue to expand our ministry, exerting ourselves vigorously in the work at hand, no doubt Jehovah’s blessing will continue with us. (Luke 13:24) We do not know what growth and increase await us in the future. But we need to be ready to welcome any future influx of worshipers. That requires preparation on our part now. Thus, we pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing and direction. In building for the future, may we all be workers with Jehovah—physically, materially, and spiritually. He will certainly bless us as we take proper care of those hastening into his Kingdom organization during the final part of these last days.—Isa. 60:8,10, 11, 22.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">• Why is it important to finish studying two books thoroughly with new disciples even if they get baptized before the second book is finished?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah is blessing his organization with an influx of new ones who are flocking to the congregations. We rejoice to see this great ingathering. However, we appreciate that these sheeplike people need continuing assistance and direction in learning to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">New ones need help to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. (Col. 1:9,10) We have the privilege to aid them in gaining a good understanding of basic doctrines of the Bible and a good grasp of what the Bible teaches concerning moral standards, Christian living, and related matters.

<p><span class="font14">Students also need to become full-grown in their powers of understanding. (1 Cor. 14:20) Experience has shown that to achieve the stature of a spiritually full-grown man, a personal Bible study with a teacher is helpful. Thus, even though a person may get baptized before completing his study of two books, wisdom dictates that his home Bible study should continue until he has completed the study of both books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER BAPTISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus said we should make disciples—baptizing and teaching them. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Much of the instructing of disciples is done </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">following</span><span class="font14"> baptism. The knowledge that a</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Although many celebrations associated with Christmas and the New Year have pagan origins, over a billion professed Christians observe these holidays every year. Many people sincerely believe that these observance? are approved by God. How can we reach the hearts of such ones with the good news during the holiday season?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BE CONSIDERATE AND RESPECTFUL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The elders make special arrangements for holiday witnessing, since many of us have time off from secular work.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Since the Christmas holidays are religious in nature, we may find many people who are more inclined to talk about God at this </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">timp</span><span class="font14">fhan at any other time of the year. We can take advantage of this fact in our introduction. For example, we might sayj ^“Millions of persons throughout the earth are celebrating Christmas and New Year’s Day. Do you think that these festivities are bringing people closer to God?”jwhether the householder feels that the observances are good or bad, after acknowledging his comments, we could say (“Many people wish that they had a better relationship with God, perhaps feeling that God is somewhat distant from them. Happily, God himself invites us to search for him./Then proceed with the Topic for Conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Taking another </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">approach</span><span class="font14">, we could say: ^“During this Christmas season, we often hear people express the hope that there will be peace on earth and goodwill toward men. Do you think God will bring peace to the earth in our time?”JThereafter we can go on to show thatJesusChrist is the foretold “Prince o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">f Peac</span><span class="font14">e.&quot; (Isa. 9: 6, 7) As the appointed Ruler in God’s government, Christ will soon take.ac-tipn^to bring lasting peace to the earth.—Dan. 2:44; Rev. 21:3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Though most people are apathetic toward the Kingdom message and take delight in their false religious holidays, Jehovah will most certainly bless our efforts to find truth seekers, for he himself “is looking for suchlike ones to worship him,” and he will direct them to his organization.—John 4:23, 24.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Peace</span><span class="font14"> book. If these books are not available, others containing similar information may be used. Continuing the Bible study until the second book is finished provides a sound education in Jehovah's purposes as well as his high Christian standards and requirements. This helps the new one to understand the meaning of Christian principles and become firmly rooted in the faith. (Col. 2:7) For further details and information on reporting such studies, see the Question Box in the November 1987 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of course, after baptism new ones should be expected to make spiritual progress. (Heb. 6:1-3) In most cases it does not take long to finish the second book. The new person is thus provided with a solid foundation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Society is pleased to extend to you an invitation to visit the recently opened visitors’ center for the Watchtower Educational Center now being constructed at Patterson, New York. The visitors’ center includes a video presentation, picture displays, and an outside observation deck. What is the purpose in constructing an educational center, and why are over four hundred brothers and sisters now working on this project?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Mankind’s greatest need in this last decade of the 20th century is to be properly educated about its Creator, Jehovah God. Jesus Christ said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) Whereas fast-moving political changes have captured the attention of much of the human race, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been actively educating millions of honest-hearted ones about God’s purpose involving life, freedom, and peace. These people are being helped to align their lives with Jehovah’s will and thus have the prospect of everlasting life.—Isa. 48:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In recent years, there has been a tremendous growth in the number of Kingdom pro-claimers worldwide. In 1980 the peak was nearly 2.3 million. By 1990 this number grew to some four million. This growth has placed an increased demand on the Society’s branch facilities throughout the world. As an example, the U.S. headquarters staff (including Brooklyn and Watchtower Farms) has increased in number nearly 75 percent during that same ten-year period. So at the present rate of growth, nearly 250 additional Bethel family members are needed each year. The same increased demands have been felt in other countries as well.</span></p><img src="okm_E_199012_files/okm_E_199012-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:495pt;height:637pt;">

<p><span class="font16">A major forward step in this worldwide Bible educational activity is the construction of the Watchtower Educational Center at Patterson, New York. When complete, the project will include housing for about 1,200 brothers and sisters. This number will consist of members of the Bethel family and students invited to the Gilead missionary school and others who may receive training from time to time. There will be classrooms, an auditorium for approximately 1,600 people, and considerable office space. These additional facilities will no doubt play a vital role in the continued Bible educational work being done worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Progress to Date</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In December 1984 a property consisting of 684 acres was purchased. It is centrally located about 70 miles north of Brooklyn Bethel and 45 miles east of the Society’s Wallkill, New York, facility. Between 1984 and 1988 many months were spent in surveying, preparing drawings, and obtaining necessary building permits. Eight houses on the property were renovated. These houses now provide accommodations for some members of the Bethel family. Since many more accommodations were needed, a total of 14 houses within seven miles of the property have been leased. Also, many brothers who live near Patterson have opened their homes to accommodate members of the Bethel family working on the project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To provide support services, several temporary buildings had to be erected. This work began in 1988. It is anticipated that nearly 75,000 cubic yards, or 10,000 truckloads, of concrete will be used on the project. So a concrete-mixing plant was moved to Patterson from Watchtower Farms. Trailers were installed to serve as construction offices. Facilities were built for the repair and maintenance of equipment. A 300- by 85-foot metal building that was constructed in 1989 now houses a temporary kitchen, a dining room that will seat up to seven hundred people, a locker room, and construction shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since the project is comparable in size to a small town, considerable work is involved in constructing some three miles of paved roads, underground utilities, and facilities for treat-</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">ing water and wastewater. This work began in 1989. One of the first projects was the building of the main entrance road, which included widening the state highway in front of the main entrance, allowing for safe entrance to and exit from the site. To provide utilities for the educational center, 30 miles of electrical conduit, 11/2 miles of water pipe, and 3 miles of sewer pipe were installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In July 1989 construction began on the Patterson Inn, a 150-unit hotel located next to the educational center. This will initially serve as housing for construction workers and then will eventually be used as guest facilities for those visiting the educational center. Occupancy of portions of the Patterson Inn by the workers is scheduled to begin in the spring of 1991.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Work is proceeding well on a 450-car parking garage, which will be used initially for additional construction shops and storage. Work has also been started on the first residential building, which will accommodate about three hundred Bethel family members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Currently, there are over four hundred workers on the project. During 1991 the number of workers will likely increase to over six hundred, as the Patterson Inn is completed. In addition to work on the above-mentioned buildings, work will also begin on the kitchen and dining room facilities, with a capacity of 1,600, and on the powerhouse. This work will require several years to complete. After 1991 a total of 11 buildings are yet to be constructed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Themselves Willingly</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In addition to Bethel family members, about 125 brothers and sisters living near Patterson have volunteered as commuter workers. Over 2,200 brothers from all parts of the country have had a share in the temporary worker program. Most serve for a period of one to four weeks. They are housed in the Society’s facility at Wallkill, New York, and travel by bus one hour each way to Patterson. Those who are married and serve for three months have been accompanied by their wives, who assist in the work at Watchtower Farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Psalm 110:3 says: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your ii</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">military force.” This is certainly true of Jehovah’s people in supporting this project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There continues to be a need for qualified brothers in the construction and engineering trades to make themselves available. (Compare Exodus 36:2.) Brothers who would like to apply for one to four weeks may receive an application from the congregation secretary or write the Society. Those who have already served in this capacity and are in a position to volunteer for a three-month period may write the Society, indicating the dates they are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another way we can assist is through our voluntary contributions. Many brothers have already made financial contributions to the work. (1 Chron. 29:3-7) Those wishing to contribute to this special project may send their donation to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society at 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In these ways, all can have a share in the important work being done. (Phil. 1:9, 10) All of us pray for Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the expansion and spiritual prosperity of his organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">A new arrangement</span><span class="font15"> has been instituted to provide information on all the tours offered at Brooklyn Bethel, Watchtower Farms, Patterson, and the Jersey City Assembly Hall. A central tour desk will answer all correspondence related to tours. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">It will no longer be necessary to write each location separately.</span><span class="font15"> All tour correspondence should be addressed to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, Attention: Bethel Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">All tour bus groups should write to the central tour desk giving information regarding their itinerary so that further instructions can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Society has current information regarding hotels and motels that offer reduced rates to those visiting the headquarters facilities. This information may be obtained by writing the tour desk.</span></p>

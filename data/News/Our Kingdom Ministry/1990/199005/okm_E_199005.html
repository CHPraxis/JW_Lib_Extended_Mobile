<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Spiritual Riches With Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Like faithful Moses, modern-day Witnesses of Jehovah know that the material treasures of this world cannot compare in value with spiritual riches. (Heb. 11:26) Money may buy houses, cars, and other possessions, but it cannot buy life, peace of mind, or the approval and blessing of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Knowledge and understanding of God's Word and purpose are true spiritual riches. (Col. 2:3) These unique riches can bring genuine happiness now, along with a solid hope for the future. How favored we are to have received such spiritual riches!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO MAKE OTHERS RICH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We can help make many others spiritually rich by introducing them to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font14"> since it can lead them to ‘hidden treasures’ of godly wisdom. (Prov. 2:4) During May, we will offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> subscription on every appropriate occasion. If we keep in mind how </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> has enriched our lives, we will not hold back but will seek out ways to offer it to as many people as we can. (Prov. 3:27) Make notations of addresses where individual magazines and brochures are placed, with a view to following up and regularly supplying magazines by having your own route.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In a spiritual sense, how can we be like the God-fearing man of Psalm 112 who distributed widely his valuable things? (Ps. 112:1, 3, 9) We need to search for sheeplike people</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bear Witness to the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus made it clear that he had come into the world to bear witness to the truth. He declared: “For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">bear witn</span><span class="font14">ess to the truth.&quot;—John 18:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> By his zealous preaching, Jesus honored Jehovah’s name. He also </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">showed ge</span><span class="font14">nuine love for the people in recognition of their sad spiritual state. Matthew wrote cohcefnihg^his activity:^And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom ... On seeing the crowds he fe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">lt pity</span><span class="font14"> for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.'TiMatt^ 9:35, 36) Like Jesus, our devotion to<sup>-</sup>JeTiovah along with our love for others should </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">move </span><span class="font14">us_to preach</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR VITAL ASSIGNMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Genuine love for people and for Jehovah motivates us to tak</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e advan</span><span class="font14">tage of every opportunity to teach people the truth about Jehovah and his wonderful works. (Ps. 96:2, 3; and help them fill their spiritual need. (Matt. 5:3) This requires that we take advantage of every opportunity to witness formally and informally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In some areas, evening witnessing has been very productive because more people are likely to be home then. Have you tried working door to door an hour or so before your Congregation Book Study or on another evening during the week? Why not make definite arrangements to do this? It may prove to be very rewarding for you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Can you find appropriate times to witness at your place of work? One sister laid several magazines on her desk so that fellow employees could see them as they passed by. Before the morning was over, all the magazines were placed. Quite a number of her coworkers showed genuine interest, and she was able to place 18 subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Silver, gold, and all other material treasures cannot compare to the spiritual riches of knowledge and understanding that we have gained through Jehovah’s organization and our study of the Bible. Genuine happiness, ways of pleasantness, peace, “length of days”—even eternal life— all become possible to those who seek spiritual riches. (Prov. 3:13-18) By sharing our spiritual riches with others, we show our appreciation for what we have received and we gain Jehovah’s continued blessing. —Prov. 19:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">145:10-13) However, the p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ressure</span><span class="font14">s of dail</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">y livin</span><span class="font14">g, the a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nxieties</span><span class="font14"> of life, and the abundance of distractions-could easily divert us from our witn</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">essing activity</span><span class="font14">, i nerefore, we need to keep in focus the urgency of bearing witness to the truth about God and his Kingdom. We must n</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot allo</span><span class="font14">w o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">urselves to be sidetracked</span><span class="font14"> from this all-im</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">portant lifesaving</span><span class="font14"> work that we have b</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">een assigned</span><span class="font14"> to do. (Matt. 24: 14; 28:19, 20) K</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eeping busy</span><span class="font14"> in. Jehovah’s se</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rvice is a protection</span><span class="font14"> for us, and it can brin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g lastin</span><span class="font14">g </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">benefit</span><span class="font14">s to those who are in need of hearing the message of truth.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> C</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">an you serve a</span><span class="font14">s a regular or an aux</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">iliary p</span><span class="font14">ioneer?

Are you </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">retired</span><span class="font14"> from secular work? Why not use your time more fully in preaching? Many </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">young on</span><span class="font14">es still </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">in </span><span class="font14">school have auxil</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">iary pioneer</span><span class="font14">ed regularly.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Come to the 1990 &quot;Pure Language&quot; District Convention</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The 1990 district conventions will have the theme “Pure Language,” and you are invited to attend. In the United States, 142 conventions are scheduled. They will commence o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">n June 7</span><span class="font14"> and will run for nine consecutive weeks. Although most will be in the English language, there will also be conventions .held in Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish. Additionally, sign-language interpretation will be featured at 16 conventions. —See pages 30-1 of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> of February 15, 1990.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s prophetic word at Zephaniah 3:SLsays: “Then I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder. &quot;J The convention this year not only wil</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">l identify </span><span class="font14">what the “pure la</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nguag</span><span class="font14">e” is but will also help, us to appreci</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ate why</span><span class="font14"> learning it and speakin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g it fluent</span><span class="font14">ly are so vital and how oun ability to.use_it_strengthens the unity of the worldwide brotherhood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> ARRIVE EARLY: </span><span class="font14">Jehovah’s organization is inviting us to feed at his spiritual table. It is a sign of respect and appreciation to arrive on time. Actually, this means that we should ayrive early eac</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">h day</span><span class="font14"> and be seated before the program begins. This requires allowing su</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">fficient tim</span><span class="font14">e to care for matters that need attention, such as parking, our vehicle and finding suitable seats for our family.—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Delegates t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o the conventions in Poland</span><span class="font14"> last year were impressed by Ihcxodl</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">y devot</span><span class="font14">ion, lave, and unity of their brothers. Deep appreciation for the spiritual provisions the convention would bring was evident. Each-morning, the brothers.werc at the convention sites early, s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eated</span><span class="font14"> an</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">d ready</span><span class="font14"> for the opening song and prayer. They stayed for the closing song and prayer, and they lingered after the program so as to fellowship with their brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> The orderliness of the brothers was exemplary. They had come to listen and to learn. Even rain falling on the open stadiums at Poznan and Chorzdw could not divert their attention from the program. The younger ones present, including small children, were well-disciplined, quiet, and attentive to the program. Families were seated together. They were exemplary in their display of deep respect for Jehovah’s table. How can we benefit from their example?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> It is Scriptural to imitate the good example of others. (2 Thess. 3:7) While our personal circumstances may be different, we too want to get the most out of our conventions. To prevent anxiety and frustration because of getting a late start to the assembly site, some families find it beneficial to set a reasonable time for retiring. By strictly adhering t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o a s</span><span class="font14">chedule, they are more likely to get a good nig</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ht’s sleep</span><span class="font14"> and be ready for an early start the next day. This a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">voids </span><span class="font14">ar</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">riving..whi1e the program is in progress,</span><span class="font14"> which is distracting and can be an annoyance to those already seated. Our thoughtfulness in this regard is t^reflection of our </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">reve</span><span class="font14">rence and respect for Jehovah and of our love &quot;and consideration for our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> A FOUR-DAY CONVENTION: </span><span class="font14">The “Pure Language&quot; District Convention will last four days.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Make it your resolve </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">not t</span><span class="font14">o </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">miss even one session</span><span class="font14">. This may require personal sacrifices and adj</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ustments </span><span class="font14">in your schedule. Some may find it necessary to make spe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">cial arrangements with their employer</span><span class="font14">. Many even forgo fin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ancial advantage</span><span class="font14">s in order to attend all sessions. However, think of what many of our b</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rothe</span><span class="font14">rs sacrificed and had to go through in order to attend the conventions in P</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oland</span><span class="font14"> last year. Does it not incite you all the more to be present at your convention for every session? Jehova</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">h will c</span><span class="font14">ertai</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nly bless</span><span class="font14"> those who make the matter a subje</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ct of sinc</span><span class="font14">e</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">re p</span><span class="font14">rayer and put forth heartfelt effort to attend.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Consider the joy expressed by a family from the Midwest after attending last year’s district convention. They said: &lt;Tt was a wonderful program of instruction, whTch we all appreciated. One outstanding new feature that really touched our hearts was the way you released the new publications. My wife and I were moved to ‘re</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ally open up</span><span class="font14">’ and give far more than we ever have at any assembly throughout the many years we have been associated. We were not alone. There was just something about the new arrangement that motivated us to do more than usual. Of course, none of us could ever give enough to Jehovah for all he has done for us and continues to do.” )</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> LISTEN INTENTLY: At </span><span class="font14">Psalpi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">50:7</span><span class="font14"> Jehovah says: Q</span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Do listen, O my people, and I will speak.”/Therefore, during the convention program, </span><span class="font14">do.nat.be distracted by sights and sounds unrelated to the material being presented from the platform. Our desire to speak the pure language fluently should motivate us to_comply fully with Jehovah’s request at Isaiah 55:2:(“Listen intently to me.” J</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> All the material to be presented at this convention is for our spiritual well-being and will serve to strengthen our resolve to remain steadfast 'in our service to Jehovah and at unity with our brothers. The convention will bring us up-to-date with the current needs and help us to ke</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ep pace with Jehovah’s</span><span class="font14"> organisation. Inattentivene ss win result in our being left behind. We must k</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eep ourse</span><span class="font14">l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ves </span><span class="font14">a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">bsorbed</span><span class="font14"> in the program in order to derive full benefit from it and thereafter put what we learn into practice.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> Is there something we c</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">an do</span><span class="font14"> so as to pay better attention to the program and remember the information presented? Yes. there is. Many convention delegates have developed the useful h</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">abit of taking notes</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1990 </span><span class="font14">during the program. Appropriate note-taking materials should be included with Bibles and songbooks as standard equipment when attending a convention. If you have viewed note-taking with skepticism, why not tj-y it during the “Pure Language” Convention? You may find that it is a good way to keep your attention riveted on what is being said and that it protects you from allowing your mind to wander.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> Notes need n</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot be extensive</span><span class="font14"> or elaborate. Usually a phrase or two will suffice for a key point. Elders find it advantageous to have neatly arranged note's for conducting a meaningful review of the convention program on the Service Meeting. Also, they may wish to inco</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rporate m</span><span class="font14">a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ny of the points presented at the </span><span class="font14">convention in their teaching and shepherdin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g work</span><span class="font14">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> SONG AND PRAYER: </span><span class="font14">We honor Jehovah by singing his praises. It is a part of our worship. Jehovah is also pleased when his people approach him in earnest prayer. (Prov. 15:8b) District conventions afford us a unique opportunity to be united with thousands of our brothers and sisters in praisin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g Jehov</span><span class="font14">ah in both song and prayer. However, some have shown a lack .of . re</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">spect for these important parts of our worship</span><span class="font14">. How? By unnecessarily arriving at the convention during or after the opening song and prayer. Or at the conclusion of the program, some leave their seats, during thesong and before the prayer. Why? On rare occasions there may be good reason for doing this. However, is^proper respect and appreciation being shown for Jehovah’s table when some relinquish the privilege of singing and joining in prayer just so they can get an early start to their cars or to eat?—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> Care must be exercised that in the pursuit of personal convenience, we do not allow the w</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">orldl</span><span class="font14">y me-first attitude or ungodly traits such as greed and selfishness to Hamper our spiritual progress. May we show the same spirit of appreciation for sacred things as our brothers did at the conventions in Poland last year, and may we walk shoulder to shoulder with them by showing appropriate respect for such lofty features of our worship, namely, prayer and the singing of praises to Jehovah.—Ps. 69:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> OUR CHRISTIAN MANNERS: </span><span class="font14">Our Christian manners and appearance at conventions have earned us a good reputation as Jehovah’s Witnesses. This is because we are serious in our worship of Jehovah and because we do </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">not view attending a convention as a </span><span class="font14">m</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ere social outing</span><span class="font14">. When coming together for such special occasions, we should maintain Christian digni-t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">v and a spiritual frame of mind,</span><span class="font14"> conducting ourselves as ministers at all times.—1 Cor. 10:31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>17</sup> However, it is disturbing to see that a few attending the conventions have become un</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">duly casual</span><span class="font14"> in their attitude, dress, speech, and conduct. What can be done when such things become evident in the local congregation or at a convention? Those who have spiritual qualifications should o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffer loving counse</span><span class="font14">l with a view to readjus</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">tme</span><span class="font14">nt. (Gal. 6:1; Eph. 4:11,12) Speaking the pure language should incite us to uphold our good reputation and high standards of conduct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>18</sup> A visitor at one of the conventions left the following note in a contribution box: “I enjoyed your program very much. I will now study the Bible with one of [the] brothers. This was my first visit to any of your assemblies. I planned to come only on Saturday, for Sunday is my church day. But so impressed was I that I came today and brought my entire family with me. But I was disappointed </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">by the adults talking</span><span class="font14"> l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oudly </span><span class="font14">while the speaker </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">was speaking</span><span class="font14">.” i</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>19</sup> It has also been observed that at some conventions a f</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ew teenager</span><span class="font14">s sit in u</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">pper portions</span><span class="font14"> or remote areas of the auditorium, pa</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ss not</span><span class="font14">es, whisper, and generally do </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">not pay attention</span><span class="font14"> to the program. Conduct of this nature indicates that they </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">still need pa</span><span class="font14">rent als</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">upervi si on</span><span class="font14"> and should be seated with the family. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Responsible paren</span><span class="font14">ts will gi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve attentio</span><span class="font14">n to these matters and provide the guidance needed by their children. (Eph. 6:4) Brothers, sisters, and young ones should appreciate that when the program i</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">s on</span><span class="font14">. it is a time to be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">listening</span><span class="font14">, not talking.—Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>20</sup> Another area where consideration and courtesy should be displayed is in connection with our place of l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">odging</span><span class="font14">. We are acquiring good motel rooms at significantly reduced rates. We should show appreciation and be consid</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">erat</span><span class="font14">e of motel_persatmel, being cqui.-teous and </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">not overly demanding</span><span class="font14">. (Gal. 6:10) Good counsel has been given regarding prop</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">er conduc</span><span class="font14">t at motels. Many have responded favorably and are earnestly striving to cooperate fully with motel personnel. Despite such cooperation, a negative attitude towa</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rd the Witnesses persists in some nl</span><span class="font14">aces.Whv?^ j</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>21</sup> Most of the brothers have displayed a fine attitude about the articles “T</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o Tip—Or Not”</span><span class="font14"> and “Tips on Tipping,” on pages 24-7 of the June 22, 1986, issue of AwafceTThis information was referred to in the insert for last year’s district conventions. It still d</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eserve</span><span class="font14">s our </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">attentio</span><span class="font14">n. Please reread these articles, as they specifically define who expect tips and how much, according to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">the custom</span><span class="font14"> in different countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>22</sup> Additionally, the above-mentioned </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> articles stress that when “attending a convention, what you do </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally reflects on the whole grou</span><span class="font14">p. People will judge the group by your behavior.” So regardless of you</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">r persona</span><span class="font14">].views about tipping, when you visit a city </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">as a delegate</span><span class="font14"> to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">use good judgmen</span><span class="font14">t an</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">d discernment</span><span class="font14"> and be ready to “do all thi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ngs fo</span><span class="font14">r </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">the </span><span class="font14">sake of the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">good new</span><span class="font14">s.&quot; —1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>23</sup> After attending last year’s district convention, a sistpr received a letter frem </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">the maid</span><span class="font14"> who cleaned her hotel room. It said,(“I would just like to thank you for leaving your </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">booklet</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">tip</span><span class="font14"> for me.... Thanks to you, I am now having Bible studies and learning to appreciate our Father Jehovah and his Only-Begotten, Jesus Christ. ... I am happy you enjoyed your stay at our hotel. I hope to see you at the next convention.”-The maid had underlined the words “booklet” and “tip” in her letter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>24</sup> Although the vast majority of the brothers bring honor to God’s name, we must admit that a few families attending conventions have given reason for complaint. For example, after renting a room with the rated capacity of no more th</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">an four or fi</span><span class="font14">ve persons, including children, so</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">me have broug</span><span class="font14">ht in up tn ten persons, and that is </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">dishone</span><span class="font14">st. To accommodate them, m</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">attresses were taken off the bed</span><span class="font14">s and placed on the floor so that some could sleep on the mattresses while others slept directly on the box springs. Then extra line</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">n was requested from</span><span class="font14"> the management. In addition, sle</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eping bags were us</span><span class="font14">ed for children to sleep in.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>25</sup> There are motelsjthat n</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o long</span><span class="font14">er </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">want</span><span class="font14"> </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">tn r</span><span class="font14">en</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">t </span><span class="font14">t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">heir rooms</span><span class="font14"> t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o Jehovah’s Witnesse</span><span class="font14">s because some have violated regulations prohibiting the cooking of food. Another complaint is that brothers have checked out of motels, l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eaving their rooms in</span><span class="font14"> an uns</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">igh</span><span class="font14">tly condition. Cleanliness and consideration should be manifested not just in our dress and conduct but also in the way we treat the property of others. Is there any reason why a rented room should not be left neat and clean? Inc</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">onside</span><span class="font14">rate behavior mars our good name. During the coming district conventions, let all of us strive to conduct ourselves so as to “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> FOR PARENTS: </span><span class="font14">Young children and teenagers are among those in</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">vited</span><span class="font14"> to the “Pure Language” District Co</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nventi</span><span class="font14">on. They too must speak the pure language fluently. How fine </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">it is to see y</span><span class="font14">oung ones who have learned to pay close attention at all Christian meetings and who areHntently interested in the convention program! (Ps. 148:12, 13) But much depends on the example and supervision of the p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">arent</span><span class="font14">s. Many young ones have been well-trained to take notes. If as a parent you have not as yet taught your children how to take notes, why not use the time remaining before your convention to do so? Even the very young can be encouraged to write down Scriptur</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e citatio</span><span class="font14">ns and related key words they hear expressed by the speakers. Some pare</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nts arrange to review main poin</span><span class="font14">ts from the day’s program after returning to their place of lodging or while traveling home.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>27</sup> Of course, most parents appreciate that the natural inclin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ation</span><span class="font14"> of children is to be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">playfu</span><span class="font14">l. They lack experience in life, and they are immature. Therefore, they have to be taught when to pay attention and how to condtict themselves at meetings. This calls for good supe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rvision</span><span class="font14"> by their parents. Some parents have been lax in this area. At times, although parents may be showing proper reverence to Jehovah du</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ring a pray</span><span class="font14">er, their children are playing and distracting others. Parents should know what their children are doing even during prayers. Also, what are they doing when they leave their seats during the program? Are children left unsupervised during or after the convention program?—Prov. 29:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>28</sup> In some cases children have been left unsupervised in motel s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">wimming p</span><span class="font14">ools while the parents are i</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">n the room</span><span class="font14">, o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ut to dinner</span><span class="font14">, or involved in other activity. This is not </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">prope</span><span class="font14">r. Some children have acted in an undisciplined and unruly manner and even have been disrespectful to older brothers an</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">d sister</span><span class="font14">s who have fried to correct them in a kindly way. Such unruliness and conduct unbefitting Christians is ofte</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">n the result </span><span class="font14">of p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ermissivenes</span><span class="font14">s and a lack of discipline in the home. It certainly s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">hould be correcte</span><span class="font14">d. All Christian parents should give close supervision to their children at all times as they bring “them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> YOUR FULL COOPERATION IS APPRECIATED: </span><span class="font14">Considerable planning and work have been done to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and other provisions are available for everyone attending the convention. To ensure the effectiveness of these arrangements, each congregation has been specifically assigned to a particular convention. Your full cooperation is vital in order to prevent overcrowding. Of course, there may be circumstances that make it necessary for a few to attend a convention in another area. However, most should be able to attend the convention at their assigned location.—1 Cor. 13:5; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>30</sup> Your full cooperation is requested in the matter of saving seats. Please keep in mind that S</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">EAT</span><span class="font14">S MAY BE SAVED </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ONL</span><span class="font14">Y FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAB- Please do not reserve seats for others. At times, extra seats are reserved for no one in particular. This is unloving and is misleading to the attendants and others looking for available seats. In harmony with the Bible counsel, we should strive to display brotherly affection and cooperate fully with the approved arrangement for saving seats.—2 Pet. 1: 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>31</sup> It is suggested that good judgment be used in bringing perso</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nal items</span><span class="font14"> to the convention site. In the past, some have br</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ought large coole</span><span class="font14">rs or other bulky items that could not be plac</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed under t</span><span class="font14">heir seats. These were placed in the aisle or on seats. This resulted in deprivin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g other</span><span class="font14">s </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">of a seat,</span><span class="font14"> and sometimes it violated fire an</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">d safety</span><span class="font14"> codes. We need to show consideration in such matters?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>32</sup> The use of video cameras and audio recording equipment is permitted at the convention site. However, those who use such equipment must exercise care to avoid disturbing or distracting others. Such equipment should qpt be set up in aisles </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">or “ex</span><span class="font14">its. No such equipment should be connected to the public addr</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ess system or electrical outlets</span><span class="font14">. Fl</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oodlights</span><span class="font14"> will not be permitted. Those who are causing a distraction or ignoring any of the above guidelines should without hesitation correct the matter when iLis brought to their attention. Attendants and others in charge will be alert to correct any violation of these guidelines, and they should receive full cooperation from those using such equipment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>33</sup> LITERATURE AND FOOD SERVICE: </span><span class="font14">As was done last year, all literature items will be distributed without charge. In addition, this year the Society will adjust and simplify the food service arrangements, making all fo</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">od items available at no charge</span><span class="font14"> to those attending the convention, in the same way as the literature. What fine provisions these are, making the w</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ork lighter and much faster</span><span class="font14"> for the benefit of everyone! No doubt such generosity on the part of God’s organization will move us with gratitude to express our appreciation in practical ways.—Prov. 11:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>34</sup> Certainly, Jehovah’s people appreciate being able to meet together at fine facilities each year in order to benefit from the delightful spiritual program that has been prepared. We also appreciate the many services and conveniences provided at such gatherings. With much care and at considerable expense to the Society, arrangements are made for adequate seating, installing expensive sound systems, operating an efficient food service, and handling a number of other arrangements and services that make attending the convention enjoyable and spiritually refreshing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>35</sup> These expenses are covered by your. voluntary contributions in support of the Society's worldwide work. For your convenience, clearly markeclcontribu-tion boxes are located throughout the convention facility. All contributions are very much appreciated, and the Society wishes to thank you in advance for your generous and unified support of Kingdom interests in this way. We are confident that all will be moved to sense their individual responsibility with regard to the changes here mentioned and will cooperate fully by sharing to the extent their circumstances allow.—Luke 6:38.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>36</sup> COME TO THE “PURE LANGUAGE&quot; DISTRICT CONVENTION: </span><span class="font14">By attending the “Pure Language” District Convention and paying close attention to the program, you will appreciate even more fully why Jehovah has given us the pure language and why we must always be on guard against any selfish tendencies that could interfere with our being at unity with our brothers. Make your plans now _tp be on hand for the opening song and to attend all sessions until the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">District Convention Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font14">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention is very much appreciated. If you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city and have not already confirmed a reservation, please do so immediately. If you find it necessary to cancel your reservation, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible so that the room can be made available to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font14">In many locations, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. So please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font14">Baptismal candidates should endeavor to be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to baptismal candidates and then call for a song. Beginning with the last verse, the attendants will direct the baptismal candidates to the immersion site or to vehicles that will take them there, while the rest of the audience completes the singing of the song. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal candidates embrace or hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font14">Volunteer help is needed for the smooth operation of a district convention. Even if you may be able to work for only a part of the convention, your services will be appreciated. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department when you arrive at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also contribute to the success of the convention, but they are required to work with a parent or other responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BADGE CARDS: </span><span class="font14">Please </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font14"> the specially designed badge card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. Being identified as a convention delegate by a clearly inscribed badge card will facilitate the operation of the simplified food service arrangement. Badge cards should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font14"> be available at the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WORDS OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font14">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font14"> times and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font14"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets, who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Please be careful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It has been reported that some motels provide easy access to television movies with immoral content or even of pornographic nature. This highlights the need to avoid unsupervised TV watching by children at these places of lodging.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Our organized use of literature began with distribution of 6,000 copies of the July 1, 1879, issue of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> magazine. Since then, a great variety of literature items have been printed and distributed in vast quantities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMPLETE-DONATION ARRANGEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> At the end of February 1990, it was explained that magazines and literature will be provided to publishers and to the interested public on a complete donation basis, that is, without asking or suggesting that a specific contribution be made as a precondition to receiving an item. When literature is offered, voluntary donations will be accepted to support the worldwide work of publishing the good news. We have faith that Jehovah will bless this arrangement.—Compare Matthew 6:33.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDLING SITUATIONS IN THE FIELD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We will continue to use Topics for Conversation to stimulate interest. W</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">here no inte</span><span class="font14">rest is shown, there is </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ho need to offer the literature.</span><span class="font14"> We do not want to waste any of our literature by offering it to those with no interest. On the other hand, where interest is shown and the householder agrees to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">read the literature,</span><span class="font14"> it may be offered. We want to use our literature wisely.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Christian meetings are an essential part of our worship of Jehovah. The apostle Paul fittingly urges us not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;as some have the custom.”—</span><span class="font14">Heb. 10:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Do you have s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">imilar</span><span class="font14"> senti</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ments </span><span class="font14">about associating with your brothers at Christian meetings? What does your </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">custom revea</span><span class="font14">l in this regard? Do you regularly attend all the meetings, including the“Congregation Book Study? ?)r do you find that you customarily miss meetings?

Have you been encouraging Memorial attenders to be'regular in their meeting attendance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Regardless of our daily routine, Paul’s ad</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">vice Cannot be r</span><span class="font14">ninimized. Althouglf ids understood that from time to time a Christian may have to miss a meeting because of poor health or other circumstances beyond his control, it certainly should not be his custom, (Rom. 2:21) With so many obligations to take care of, which may include a number of theOcratic activities, a Christian needs to make sure</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The following are some remarks you might make after showing the literature: “If you would enjoy reading this publication, I would be happy to leave it with you.” Likely the householder will ask: “How much does it cost?” You could reply: “We are not engaged in a commercial work. We are not selling this literature. The work we are doing in your neighborhood today is being done voluntarily in 212 lands around the world to help people learn the way to everlasting life. If you would care to make a donation toward this work, I would be glad to accept it.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> When offering the magazines, you could raise questions about a specific article and then say: “I would like you to note the details in this article. If you would like to read these two magazines, I would be happy to leave them with you.” If they are accepted, you could add: “I am glad to be able to make this information available to you. I think you will find the subject truly informative. In fact, I would like to come back next week to get your viewpoint. You will note that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> is published in 107 languages and distributed in nearly 14,000,000 copies around the world.

(Phil. 1:10) Meetings are included among the more important things for a Christian and are essential for our spiritual well-being.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> When Paul wrote the Romans, he said that he was Iqpging to see them. Why? In order to impart some spiritual gift so that they would “be made firm.” (Rom. 1:11) He felt that association was important, yes, needed, since he continued, saying:C“That there may be an interchange of en-couragement.’yOr as the footnote in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reference Bible</span><span class="font14"> states: (“To be encouraged together.”/ (Rom. 1:12) Even Paul, an apostle, recognized his need for encouragement through Christian association.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In like manner, at our meetings we should incite one another to love and fine works. A friendly smile and a warm greeting can have a positive effect on others. Upbuilding comments, well-prep</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ared parts</span><span class="font14"> on the program, seeing others progress spiritually, and just being among the brothers there at the meetings can be very encouraging. Even if we are tired at the end of the day, usually we wiirfind that wefeel much better after attending the meeting. Christian friendship and the love our brothers express for us will encourage us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.” (Heb. 12:1) By listening attentively to God’s Word, we can be prepared to hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering. Truly, there are many blessings that come from being at The meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Now as never bef</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ore</span><span class="font14">, we must hold fast our faith and incite others to love and fine works. We do not want to fall into the custom or habit of forsaking the gathering of ourselves together. We should make a conscientious effort to encourage and help others, including Memorial attenders, to be at the meetings regularly. ,In this way, we will show our love for others and our appreciation for Christian meetings.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Through Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> This past service year in the United States, over 535,000 Bible studies were conducted each month. Perhaps half of the 817,000 publishers in this country had some share </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font14">. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">this joyfu</span><span class="font14">l a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ctivity</span><span class="font14">. Of course, if about half of the publishers shared in this activity, it would mean that the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">other half did </span><span class="font14">not share in it. How can more of us enjoy<sup>-</sup>ttre&quot;&quot;Special satisfaction that comes from teaching someone else the truth?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Because we love God and neighbor, we want to share the truth with others. But we need help from Jehovah in our ministry. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) Hence, would it not be good to approach Jehovah in prayer and ask him to help us to start a home Bible study? (1 John 5:14,15) Then we must acUa harmony with our request and participate in the field ministry as fully as our circumstances will allow, offering a home Bible study whenever the opportunity presents itself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Over the past few years, we have placed millions .of-books, .booklets, and brochures with people in the territory. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever, True Peace, </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font14"> books, among others, can be found in the homes of thousands of people who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. This represents a vast field of opportunity for starting new Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> When a householder informs us that he is familiar with our work or that he already has our literature, we should t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ell him</span><span class="font14"> how pl</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eased we ar</span><span class="font14">e. (See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning,</span><span class="font14"> page 20.) If he </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">has a </span><span class="font14">publication, we could kindly suggest that he get itj)nd let us </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">point out som</span><span class="font14">e interesting features that would be Of benefit to him and his family. If the response </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">is positiv</span><span class="font14">e, we could offer.a home </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible study</span><span class="font14">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> A variationorthe foregoing would be for us to take the init</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">iativ</span><span class="font14">e and i</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nquire if the householder has our lit</span><span class="font14">e</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rature</span><span class="font14">. This may be especially effective in territory where we have placed much literature. After a friendly introduction, we could say that because of our frequent visits, many of the neighbors have some of our literature. We are interested in seeing people be</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nefi</span><span class="font14">t from the information published^. We could then ask the householder if </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">he has any</span><span class="font14"> of our </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">liter-</span><span class="font14">jature. If he does, we could kind</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ly a</span><span class="font14">sk if we may seeit and then offer to show him how we stud</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">y it.</span><span class="font14"> A short demonstration may result in a home Bible study. If he does not have our litera-tiiXfix</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">WP can prese</span><span class="font14">nt the current offer or ask him directly if his family would like to have a free home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">USE DISCERNMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Since people are busy, it is wise to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">be discer</span><span class="font14">ning and not overstay our welcome. It may be that the first few studies could be limited to about 15. minutes. If the householder knows that a great deal of his'time will not.be tak</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">en,</span><span class="font14"> he may be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">willing t</span><span class="font14">o receive regular visits from us. Once the study is’ established and the householder's interest has developed, a longer period of time may be spent on the study. Of course, some will want to study for a longer period right from the beginning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> There are sheeplike ones in the field who need our help, and many of them have our literature. Undoubtedly, some are sighing and groaning over the detestable things being done on earth today. (Ezek. 9:4) It is our privilege not only to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">distribu</span><span class="font14">te literature about the Kingdom that will remedy mankind’s woes but also to reach honesthearted ones with the truth through Bible studies.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">educational work, we will be happy to accept it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> In some cases, the subject of donations for our worldwide work may be awkward to discuss. For example, an interested householder may ask: &quot;Are you giving it away?” We might reply: “If you want to read the publication and would like to have it, yes, it’s yours. I would like to stop by next week to discuss what we have talked about and to tell you more about our worldwide work.” On su</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">bsequent v</span><span class="font14">isz. its the householder<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">5</a></sup> <a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">6</a></sup>maybe informed dS to how our work is financed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Or the householder may immediately accept the literature and reply, “Thank you.” You could respond by saying: “You are welcome. I know you will enjoy it. Many wonder how this work is financed, since we do it worldwide. Many who accept our publications have expressed appreciation for what they will learn and have volunteered a small donation to make further distribution possible. If people do that, we are pleased to accept it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IS THERE GENUINE INTEREST?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> It is obviously not our purpose to distribute literature at random. We want the literature to achieve its intended purpose, namely, to help sincere people learn more about Jehovah’s marvelous purposes. It could be wasteful to leave literature with individuals who have no appreciation for</span></p></li></ul>

Hbw might such interest besTwwn? A kindly willingness to converse with you is a good sign. Or paying attention while you speak, responding to questions, and expressing an opinion indicate involvement in the discussion. Speaking to you in a respectful, neighborly manner suggests a kindly disposition. Following along as you read from the Bible implies a respect for God’s Word. Often, it is helpful to ask if they would read the literature being offered. Also, you might suggest a return visit to continue the conversation. A positive response is further evidence of their interest. When you observe such evidences of sincere interest, likely the individual will make good use of any literature received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> This adjustment in our method of work provides further evidence that “we are not peddlers of the word of God.” (2 Cor. 2:17) It also proves we are separate from the world.—John 17:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> With the destruction of Babylon the Great drawing near, there are growing pressures against all religious elements. Our main concern is that the vital worldwide Kingdompreaching work continues to move ahead without hindrance, bringing many more to salvation.—Matt. 24:14; Rom. 10:13,14.</span></p>

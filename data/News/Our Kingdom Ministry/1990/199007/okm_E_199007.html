<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Schoolchildren are often asked what they plan to do during the summer, and when they return to school, they may be asked to give a report on what they did. Indeed, all of us, young and old, do well to ask ourselves: ‘What have we planned to do with our summer? When it has passed, will we </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be able to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">give </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">a repor</span><span class="font13">t of a worthwhile, productive summer?’ We will if we heed the advice to ‘buy_out the opportune time for ourselves.’—Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFIT FROM CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> One thing all of us should have included in our plans is attending the “Pure Language” District Conven-tipn. Afterward, we Tib well to review our notes to see what points we Earned and can apply in our lives as praisers of Jehovah. At Ephesians 4^25 we are encouraged toO'speak truth each one of you with his neigh-bor.’^By doing this, we will be helping others to\“call upon the name of Jehovah, in ordej to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”-j-Zeph. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The world thinks of progress primarily from a technological or material standpoint. But Jehovah’s people are not that way. Rather, we exert ourselves to be spiritually progressive. We are glad to have received the encouragement that led us to become active and fruitful disciples of Christ. —John 15:8; 2 Pet. 1:5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the Gospels the term “disciple” is applied principally to those who not only believe in Christ’s teachings but also follow them closely. (Matt. 28: 19, 20) Do Bible students appreciate that fact? How can we encourage them to make progress in becoming disciples?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DIRECT INTEREST TO THE ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The student’s progress is definitely linked to his appreciation for Jehovah’s organization. Therefore, part of our responsibility as teachers is to direct the student's interest toward God’s organization. The brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide</span><span class="font13"> provides an </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">conducted. The 573,544 studies reported this April represent an increase of 300 over April of last year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">May we continue to keep Jehovah’s commandments and observe the direction given through his organization so as to see further increase.—Acts 16:4, 5.</span></p>

We might be able to participate in evening witnessing, since the period of d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">aylight lasts </span><span class="font13">longer during the summer months. Many people are at home in the evening and tend to be in a more relaxed mood, thus making it easier for us to talk with them about the Kingdom good news that we have been taught. —Isa. 50:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When opportunities for informal witnessing present themselves, we can direct attention </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">to one of th</span><span class="font13">e_hxo-chures. While away from home, we might be able to locate The Kingdom Hall, attend meetings, and share in field service with The local brothers and sisters. This should prove to be a fine source of encouragement for both us and the brothers with whom we associate.—Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If we are going to be away from our own congregation at the end of the month, we should mail our. flelii </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font13">excellent framework for doing this. Does your Bible student have a copy? If not, see that he receives one right away. Encourage him to read it, and explain to him that you will be considering just a brief portion of it at each study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The information on pages 14 and 15 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Doing God’s Will</span><span class="font13"> brochure is designed to build appreciation for each of the congregation meetings. Why not cover just one or two paragraphs each week? Show how each meeting gives training and instruction to fill a particular need. Help the student to see that spiritual growth results from “the gathering of ourselves together.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) Warmly encourage him to join us at the Kingdom Hall. There he will personally experience the unity and love we enjoy as Jehovah’s congregated people.—Ps. 133:1; John 13:35.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In view of the oft-changing world scene, how appropriate that the circuit assembly theme for the 1991 service year is “Stay Awake and Keep Your Senses.” (1 Thess. 5:6) This series will begin in September. All of us should make preparations to attend as soon as our circuit overseer informs us of the dates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Some of the program highlights will include a four-part symposium designed to help us ‘keep our senses in all things.’ (2 Tim. 4:5) In spite of a possibly senseless past, how can we now be successful in avoiding Satan’s snares and resisting the spirit of the world? Be sure not to miss out on this vital information. Throughout the two-day assembly, we will also have nly, you will gain understanding of the Scriptural basis for the answers.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">By Telephone</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We prefer to preach the good news to people face-to-face, but circumstances may make witnessing over the telephone a necessary alternative. Publishers temporarily or permanently confined to their homes because of illness or physical disability may make good use of the telephone for witnessing. Also, telephone calls can be very successful in contacting the residents of high-security buildings, mobile-home courts, or other areas where one may not be permitted to enter without a prior invitation. Telephone witnessing presents unique challenges, but with careful thought and planning, these can be overcome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Sometimes names may be obtained from directories in lobbies of buildings or from mailboxes. Telephone directories can then be used to locate the telephone numbers. This should be done under the direction of the service overseer so that telephone territories can be organized and complete records kept.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PREPARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A warm, pleasing voice is needed for effective telephone witnessing. Avoid making calls early in the day, late at night, and during mealtimes. It is not necessary to let the telephone ring many times. If you reach a telephone answering machine, you might say: “My name is . . . , and I am calling to share the Bible’s hope for the future. I will call you again.” It may be best to treat the call as a not-at-home and telephone again at another time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Thoroughly rehearse your presentation beforehand so that it does not sound as if you are reading it. Make the householder feel that you are personally interested in him by attempting to involve him in the conversation. Personalize your call by using your first and last name in your introduction, and strive to use the householder’s name throughout the conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Speak slowly and deliberately, but do not pause unless actually asking a question, as a pause may be interpreted as a question. You might say, “My name is ... , and I am calling you because I am not able to come to see you personally.&quot; Then, without pausing, you can continue as follows: “The purpose of my call is to invite your opinion on a very interesting question. Have you ever wondered if . . . ?” You can change the question by asking, “Has it ever occurred to you . . . ?” or “Have you ever thought about. . . ?” There are no wrong answers to these questions, and they provide an easy way for the householder to enter the conversation. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Do not</span><span class="font13"> invite negative responses by saying, “I hope I am not interrupting you” or “I hope you are not too busy.” Assume it is a good time unless the householder tells you otherwise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If the person asks, “Whom do you represent?” simply say without pausing, “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I am calling to invite your opinion on this interesting question. Have you ever wondered ... ?” If the householder asks, “Where did you get my telephone number?” you could reply, “From the directory, and I am calling to invite your opinion on this interesting question. Has it ever occurred to you .. . ?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Some have had success in simply telling the householder that we have a free program for answering Bible questions and then mentioning some of the chapter titles in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book. Or you could say, “Since your building is secured due to high crime, I am calling to invite your opinion. Why do you think there is such a high crime rate today?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> In one high-security building, not much success was experienced until telephone witnessing was tried. The result was that 14 new Bible studies were started. Thus, limited-access buildings can constitute virtually untouched territory and have tremendous potential. With a positive attitude, knowing that we have Jehovah’s help, we may find telephone witnessing another effective way to present the good news.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Encourage Progress </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font13">in knowledge, understanding, and application of its principles. For this reason we will continue the study in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font13"> or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font13"> book even if the student gets baptized before completing these publications. The student can receive copies of these books even if he will not be ready to begin studying a second book for several months. This may whet his spiritual appetite, stimulating him to do additional reading that will hasten his progress. Also, we should point out the value of having </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> subscriptions and obtaining other publications of the Society in order to keep up with the “measure of food supplies at the proper time.” (Luke 12:42) Those who do so will be rooted, built up, and stabilized in the faith.—Col. 2:7.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Since the pressures of life are continuing to mount, we believe all will derive benefit and refreshment from this material prepared for our encouragement. We will see ways by which we can be even more alert to our personal spiritual needs and those of our families and others in the congregation. Determine to be present for the entire circuit assembly and to keep attentive throughout the program, “for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.”—Rom. 13:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> As prospective fellow Witnesses of Jehovah, Bible students need our help if they are to grow to maturity. (Heb. 5:14) We should offer appropriate commendation to encourage progress. (Phil. 3:16) Is he sharing with family and acquaintances the things he is learning? If he qualifies, has he joined the Theocratic Ministry School? Is he desirous of becoming a publisher of the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> If we as teachers do our part, we can look forward to Jehovah's rich blessing. (2 Cor. 9:6) Never should we forget the power of prayer in behalf of Bible students. Ask Jehovah to direct them to respond to what they are learning. (1 Cor. 3: 6, 7) May they take decisive action to become actively associated with the congregation and thus add further glory and praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

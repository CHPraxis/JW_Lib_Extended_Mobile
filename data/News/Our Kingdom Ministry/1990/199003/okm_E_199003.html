<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Man’s Need for Wise Direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 14:12—Human wisdom not reliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 2:6, 7—Jehovah gives practical wisdom.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Build Faith in God’s Word</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> If ever there was a time when strong faith was needed, it is now. Many people have no faith at all and no hope for the future. Religious and political leaders have raised false hopes so often that many people openly despair. Truly, as the apostle Paul explained, “Faith is not a possession of all people.” (2 Thess. 3:2) However, faith is a possession of Jehovah’s Witnesses. We have complete confidence that the promises found in God’s Word will be fulfilled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Strong faith makes Jehovah’s Witnesses stand out as different from other people. It motivates fine works that benefit others as well as ourselves, while bringing honor to God. Such faith results from allowing God’s Word to exert power in our lives. The present-day international brotherhood of genuine Christians demonstrates the value of building faith in the Bible as the inspired Word of God.—2 Tim. 3:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY HELP OTHERS BUILD FAITH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Since lives are at stake, we have strong reason for helping others to build their faith. With this in mind, during March we will offer </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font12"> for the first</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continuing Our Ministry Without Letup</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The scene of this world is changing rapidly as we move deeper into the time of the end. (1 Cor. 7:31) In fulfillment of Bible prophecy, worldshaking events are taking place. As we contemplate what is happening both in the world around us and within the theocratic organization, we can appreciate how urgent it is that we preach “the good news” of the Kingdom.—Mark 13:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It was our Leader and Exemplar, Jesus Christ, who gave the command to make disciples. In doing so, he guaranteed the success of that work by his promise, “I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Jesus’ disciples took his words seriously, and even when facing strong opposition, “they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:42) What a fine example they set for us!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As we read the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1990 Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> we see that Jehovah has blessed our ministry by bringing about fine increases in new disciples. In some lands the increases reported are truly spectacular. The overall increase worldwide exceeds by far what any of us could have imagined just a few years ago. (Isa. 60:22) But what about our local time in the field. The purpose of this new book is to help people see that the Bible is God’s Word. It discusses and refutes many of the false charges leveled against God’s Word. It gives satisfying answers to a number of questions, such as: Is the Bible unscientific? Does it contradict itself? Is it just myth and legend? Did the miracles mentioned in the Bible really happen? Has archaeology disproved the historical accuracy of the Bible? In addition, this publication presents many fine proofs of the inspiration of the Bible. It also calls attention to the infallible prophecies of the Bible and its wonderful overall harmony.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The profound practical wisdom of the Bible and its power to change people for good are only part of the evidence that proves that the Bible is God’s Word. We are responsible to help people learn of this evidence. To do this, we must first teach them to believe what the Bible says.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> How were most of us helped to build faith in God’s Word? Most likely it was by means of a home Bible study that someone patiently conducted with us. So the placing of a Bible </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">territory? And what about our individual ministry? Are we rejoicing over our part in the ministry as well as over the collective ministry of our fellow workers everywhere? Are we continuing our individual effort in the ministry without letup?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR INDIVIDUAL PART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Quite obviously, not all territories are equally productive. (Compare Matthew 13:23.) It is also true that some territories, such as Ireland and Quebec, have become productive only after many years of hard work on the part of zealous ministers. There are many opposers in some areas, and in others the people in general are apathetic and unresponsive toward the Kingdom message. In still other places, there are so many workers in the field that there is little territory to be covered. But regardless of the type of territory we have to work in, our zeal must never falter. The apostle Paul wrote, “Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out.” (Gal. 6:9) His words of admonition apply to all Christians. How will we be able to do that? What will help us to continue our ministry without letup?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> When honestly evaluating the evidence, no sincere person can fail to accept that the Bible is God’s Word. This new book presents much of that evidence in an easily accessible form. We want to encourage others to accept the Bible as God’s Word and to live by its inspired counsel. Those who do so will come to echo joyfully the psalmist’s heartfelt prayer: “O see that I have loved your own orders. O Jehovah, according to your loving-kindness preserve me alive. The substance of your word is truth. and every righteous judicial decision of yours is to time indefinite.”—Ps. 119:159,160.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Through his Word, the Bible, Jehovah lovingly provides direction for all who seek his way of protection through the “great tribulation.” (Matt. 24:21) During March, we can encourage others to read and study God’s Word by offering the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’sT</span><span class="font12"> for a contribution of $1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As the end of this present wicked system of things draws ever closer and we see how Jehovah is richly blessing our ministry, it is imperative for us to heed the apostle Peter’s admonition to ‘brace </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">up o</span><span class="font12">ur minds for activity.’—1 t’et. 1:13; Isa. 60:22.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question Box</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">• How should Jehovah’s Witnesses view tape recordings from sources other than the Society?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Society provides an abundance of spiritual food in various forms, including cassette tape recordings. These include cassette recordings of the Bible itself and others based on Society publications, such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!, My Book of Bible Stories,</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher.</span><span class="font12"> Kingdom melodies and several dramas have been produced. However, we need to exercise caution with regard to private tape recordings that circulate and that may appear to be similar in nature. Because of our being such a trusting brotherhood, some may at times accept and listen to copies of tapes from others without ascertaining their origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sometimes recorded talks that circulate border on speculation or make use of sensational information. Would it not therefore be wise to follow Paul’s counsel at 2 Timothy 3:14? There Paul, after warning about impostors, stressed the importance of knowing the persons we are listening to. We need to make sure that we do not listen to anything that goes “beyond the things that are written” in the Holy Scriptures and in the spiritual food provided by “the faithful and love for others by exerting ourselves in prea</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ching</span><span class="font12"> about the Kingdom and in making disciples? In a special way each year at the Memorial celebration, we remember what Jehovah God </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and Jesus have done for us. (Luke </span><span class="font12">22:19; ICor. 11:23,24) Such contemplative remembrance s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hould move us </span><span class="font12">to positive action according to our individual abilities and circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> On March 25, most congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will present a special talk on the subject “Reach Out forthe R</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">eal Life</span><span class="font12">!” What a fine opportunity for new ones to begin associating with the congregation! Those who attend the special talk should be encouraged to be present for the Memorial celebration on April 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASE DISTRIBUTION OF OUTSTANDING MAGAZINES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> play an important role in our public ministry, while providing spiritual food and timely reading for all of ns. All Kingdom publishers will appreciate the special effort that has gone into preparing the magazines fox April a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd May</span><span class="font12">. We will be highlighting these issues when presenting </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 4, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1) </span><span class="font12">discreet slave.”—1 Cor. 4:6; Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">In some areas tapes for teaching children the Bible are being advertised and sold. These tapes purportedly originate with brothers and have been circulated among some congregations. While the motive may appear to be good, would this not amount to using theocratic connections for personal advantage? (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font12"> June 1977, page 4, and December 1979, page 4; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> September 1987, page 4.) Jehovah’s organization is providing more than enough Bible-based instruction to train our children. Therefore, we discourage the circulation of such tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some individuals may make tape recordings of congregation meetings or assembly and convention programs for their personal use. Such recordings may also be appreciated by members of the congregation who for some good reason are not able to be present at the meetings. However, these should not be made for distribution among the brothers in general or offered for sale to others. May we make full use of all that Jehovah has provided through his organization for our spiritual encouragement and upbuilding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IPRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">X____________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With Discernment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul emphasized the need to use discernment in presenting the good news to people with differing beliefs and backgrounds. In our day, some people profess to be religious, while others are not spiritually inclined and do not appreciate spiritual values. As publishers of the good news, we must make the Kingdom message appealing “to people of all sorts&quot; by using discernment in the ministry.—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDERSTANDING THE HOUSEHOLDER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The practical application of discernment in the field service involves the ability to adapt our presentation to the householder’s interests. This requires good preparation. By being thoroughly familiar with the wide variety of subjects considered in the books and magazines available, the publisher can be ready to present the good news with a variety of talking points. As we talk to older ones, youths, family heads, housewives, women in the work force, and others, we need to take into account their personal circumstances and use discernment in selecting material to present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As you approach the householder, be alert to the surroundings. You may be able to discern that the householder is a parent, of a particular religious background, quite interested in the care of his home, and so forth. With this information, you can adjust your introduction to fit the householder’s circumstances and interests. By tactful, discreet questions and attentively listening to the person’s comments, you may discern his beliefs and feelings and then determine the best way to continue your presentation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TAILORING YOUR PRESENTATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If on your approach to the house you observe toys or children, you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased Activity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">subscriptions. Endeavor to become thoroughly familiar with each issue as soon as you receiveTF. This will stimulate your zeal for presenting it in the field when offering subscriptions and individual copies or when presenting two magazines with one of the brochures to those who do not subscribe.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Can you make room in your personal schedule to auxiliary pioneer during April and May? If several publishers in the congregation arrange to pioneer at the same time, they can help and encourage one another during this special period of increased activity. The elders </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">will be pleased</span><span class="font12"> to help by making additional arrange-might open the present Topic for Conversation by saying: “We have been talking with parents in the community about guidelines they provide for their children. Many parents are concerned about the lack of moral guidance for children in the school system. Have you observed a problem along these lines?” Listen to the householder’s response. If the response indicates that the householder has a religious leaning, you might continue: “It is interesting that the Bible points to the need for us and our children to receive wise direction. Notice what is stated here at Proverbs 14:12.” After reading the scripture, you might say: “I was reading something just recently that stressed how practical the Bible’s counsel is for us.&quot; Turn to page 174 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? </span><span class="font12">and read the last paragraph in the chapter. Offer the book for $1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If the householder’s response indicates that he does not value the Bible’s advice, you can show discernment by altering your presentation and saying: “Do you mind if I ask why you came to that conclusion?” After listening to the response, you might continue: “I can understand why you feel the way you do. In fact, recently I read something in this publication that I’m sure you would find interesting.” Turn to page 6 and read paragraphs 3 and 4. Also, read the first sentence in paragraph 5 on page 7. Ask the householder if he would like to consider what other people accept as proof of the Bible’s authenticity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> As we prepare well and show discernment in Jehovah’s service, we will be able to say as did the apostle Paul, “I have become al) things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.”—1 Cor. 9:22; Prov. 19:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">mepts for group witnessing where necessary.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Think se</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">riously</span><span class="font12"> about your own circumstances, such as family responsibilities, physical health, secular work, or school schedule. If you are unable to pioneer at thistime, to what extent can you increase your participation in the field ministry? Certainly Jehovah is pleased with whole-souled service .that expresses our love and appreciation for him and for the precious gift of his Son, Jesus. As we examine ourselves in the light of God’s Word and brace up our minds for activity, we can be confident of having Jehovah’s spirit to sustain us in offering acceptable sacrifices of praise.—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We can keep active and make our ministry successful if we put our trust in Jehovah and rely upon his strength to sustain us. Always have in mind that Jehovah is the one who makes the field productive. (1 Cor. 3:6) In answer to our prayers for help, Jehovah provides counsel, practical instruction, and an abundant supply of Bible literature for our personal use and for helping others to come to know him. Are we taking full advantage of these provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAINTAIN A RIGHT ATTITUDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> If we have a negative attitude, that can be a serious obstacle in the way of a productive ministry. If we have formed an unfavorable opinion about the people in our territory on the basis of their previous unresponsiveness, that attitude will be reflected in our tone of voice, facial expression, and lack of diligent preparation for the field service. We have received the commission to preach and teach, and we have not been told that the work is finished. Our desire to be obedient and submissive to divine direction should move us to continue our ministry without letup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah’s purpose regarding the warning of the wicked and the gathering in of disciples will be accomplished before the end comes. We can share in the joy of the ministry now and look forward to eternal blessings among God’s people if we demonstrate our faith and love by continuing our ministry without letup.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Many today view the Bible as outdated and unrealistic. However, God’s Word has the power to change lives. (Heb. 4:12) This has been manifested in the thinking, conduct, and improved attitudes of a wide variety of people. (Eph. 4:24) Applying the Bible’s counsel contributes to a happy family environment. It promotes neighborly relations, regardless of race, color, or social standing. —Luke 10:29-37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Our personal experience with God’s Word should moveus to encourage others to investigate for themselves the true value of the Bible. An excellent framework for doing this has been provided in our new Topic for Conversation, “Why Read the Bible?” How can we use this topic along with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font13"> and either the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Trinity</span><span class="font13"> brochure or the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font13"> brochure in our ministry during November?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> After a brief introduction, we could say: “With so many pressures and problems affecting families today, we’re calling to direct attention to the only real source of practical help. In the past, people often looked to the Bible for guidance, but times have changed, haven’t they? Do you think the Bible can help solve today’s problems, such as the misuse of drugs, delinquency, and broken homes? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says at 2 Timothy 3:16. [Read.] Do you think the Bible can exert that kind of beneficial influence? [Allow for response.] Most people need and want some kind of direction when facing problems or making decisions in life, don’t they? Consider where following God’s Word can lead us. [Read John 17:3.] The Bible gives clear direction for resolving personal difficulties and outlines a sure hope for the future.” If the person shows genuine interest in gaining an understanding of God’s Word, we could demonstrate the value of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font13"> or one of the brochures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Help your Bible students to get acquainted with the many features of Jehovah’s earthly organization. Following the first-century pattern, all of Jehovah’s people belong to congregations that are made up of elders, ministerial servants, and publishers. Today, the members of the congregations enjoy attending five meetings a week. There are periodic assemblies and conventions scheduled during the year, and these provide special instruction along with opportunities to associate with fellow Witnesses from different areas.

Isaiah 55:6, 7 could be used to show that the true God can be found. But man must seek God now, just as the apostle Paul pointed out to his audience on the Areopagus. (Acts 17: 26, 27) Just as back there, Jehovah may open the minds and hearts of some of our listeners so that they too will become believers.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Are You Ready to Face a Faith-Challenging Medical Situation?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> No one thinks much about the possibility of being in a hospital today or tomorrow. Still, ‘time and unforeseen occurrence befall us all.’ (Eccl. 9:11) Even if you do not accept medical treatment as your preferred form of health care, what will you do to protect yourself from an unwanted blood transfusion should an accident leave you unconscious and you are rushed to a hospital? Yes, an accident or a suddenly deteriorating health situation can a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">bruptly bring you face-to-fac</span><span class="font13">e with a ch</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">alleng</span><span class="font13">e to your faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> If you should find yourself in a hospital for any reason, what will you do to maintain integrity if someone there tells you that you will die without a blood transfusion? Will you hastily accept that this claim truly represents your condition? Are you fully convincecLthat you do not want blood?. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Are you ready to face this challenge to your faith and abstain from blood’?—</span><span class="font13">Acts 15:28, 29.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep this information where you can quickly find it as needed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Successfully resistingan unwanted, spiritually contaminating blood transfusion starts with a firm conviction. Such a conviction must be based on a clear understanding of what the Bible says about blood. Otherwise, you can, in the emotion of the moment, easily be intimidated by someone who claims to know more about the situation than you do. Would you be misled into thinking that maybe doctors </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">kno</span><span class="font13">w more about blood than God does? Surely, in these circumstances you will </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">want to be “firmly resolve</span><span class="font13">d” to do “what is right” in Jehovah's eyes^ no matter what mere humans may say. (Deut. 12:23-25) But do you have to face this challenge all by yourself?—Eccl. 4: 912.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">HOSPITAL INFORMATION SERVICES AND HOSPITAL LIAISON COMMITTEES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> To assist those who need help when faced with a blood transfusion problem, the Society has set up Hospital Information Services at Brooklyn. It has also established 100 Hospital Liaison Committees in major U.S. cities. These committees are made up of more than 600 clderyspecially trained for this work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">’ Hospital Information ServicesJs able to do research in more than 3,600 medical journals worldwide to locate information on the availability and e</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffectivene</span><span class="font13">ss of many forms of </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">bloodles</span><span class="font13">s surgery and treatment. It then supplies Hospital Liaison Committees, health care centers, and some doctors with information on these medical advances. (Sometimes Hospital Information Services has sent out medical articles that show what can be done without blood and successfully defused an ongoing confrontation at a. hospital.) It keeps the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">com</span><span class="font13">mittees posted on favorable </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">court decisio</span><span class="font13">ns that will assist judges in looking at our cases with added insight. It also maintains records on over 7,000 cooperative physicians so that the committees have up-to-date files to use when blood transfusion problems arise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Hospital Information Services also supervises the training and work of the Hospital Liaison Committees.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">In the cities where they are located, Hospital Liaison Committees regularly make informative presentations to hospital staffs to^ improve relations with them. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">also poll these staffs to find a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ny </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">additional doctors wh</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">o </span><span class="font13">will treat us_without using blood. These brothers stand ready to help you, but there are c</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">rucial advance step</span><span class="font13">s you must take, to lay the groundwork for them to do that most effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">CRUCIAL ADVANCE STEPS —HAVE YOU TAKEN THEM YET?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> First, make </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">sure a</span><span class="font13">ll in the family have their personal medical directive document </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thoroughly</span><span class="font13"> filled out—dated, signed, and witnessed. Some brothers arriving at a hospital with an undated and7oFunwitnessed document have had its validity </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">challeng</span><span class="font13">ed. And do all our unbaptized children have their filled-out identification cards? If not, in an emergency involving your child, how do hospital personnel know your position on blood and whom to call?</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Think what could </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">happe</span><span class="font13">n to you if you should arrive in a serious condition aLIlie emergency room of a hospital, unconscious, and/or unable to Apeak for yourself. If you do not have the.documcnt with you, and there is no relative or elder yet at the hospital to speak for you, and it is'conciuded that you need blood,' you will likely receive a blood transfusion. Unfortunately, this has happened to some. But when we have the document, it speaksToFas, expressing our will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> That is why a medical document is better than a medical bracelet or necklace. The latter do not explain our Bible-based reasons for our position and do not have signatures verifying what is stated. A Canadian court decision said about a sister’s document.(“[The patient] has chosen in the only way possible to notify doctors and other providers of healthcare, should she become unconscious or otherwise unable to convey her wishes, that she does not consent to blood transfusions.&quot; ’So </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">never be</span><span class="font13"> without it!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">&quot; Since our medical directive is designed mainly for dealing with emergency situations, then in elective surgery you would be wise t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">o write out your own </span><span class="font13">perso</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nalized, m</span><span class="font13">ore complete advance directive (based on our medical directive) so that you can include specifics, such as the type of surgery and the names of the doctors and the hospital. It is your right to do this and thus ensure the treatment of your choice. Even though you and the doctor may not anticipate serious problems, explain that this directive is to be followed in case of any unexpected developments.—Prov. 22:3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> The next important step is to talk to the necessary medical personnel that you will have to deal with in either elective or emergency treatment. To whom especially should you speak?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">TALK TO MEDICAL PERSONNEL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> THE MEDICAL TEAM: This is a time when the fear of man must not prevail. (Prov. 29:25) If you appear unsure, someone may deci</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">de you are n</span><span class="font13">oLsincere. When surgery is needed, elective or emergency, you or the nearest family member must with determination ask some pointed questions of the head of the surgical team. One important question is, Will the team respect the patie</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nt’s wish</span><span class="font13">es and in all circumstances treat without bl</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ood?</span><span class="font13"> Without this assurance you would not be well protected.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>M</sup> State plainly and with dignified conviction what your wishes are. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Make it clear that you want alternative nonblood medical management of your problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Calmly and confidently discuss both your own advance medical directive and also the hospital’s release from liability form. If the surgeon is unwilling to work with your wishes, you will save time if you asic the hospital administrator to locate another doctor for you. That is part of his job.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Of all on the medical team that you need to talk to before surgery, YOU MUST </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT FAIL </span><span class="font13">TO SPEAK T</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">O THIS DOCTOR</span><span class="font13">. Charged with keeping you alive while the surgeon operates, the anesthesiologist is the one who makes d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecisions about such matters as the </span><span class="font13">use of blootLSo you are not fully protected </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">by just </span><span class="font13">talking to t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">he surgeon.</span><span class="font13"> Hence, you must speak with and convince the anesthesiologist as to your position, determining whether it will be respected_ocopt.—Compare Luke 18:3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> The usual practice, it seems, is for the anesthesiologist to visit the patient brieflyyrathejc laje on the night before surg</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ery—too late</span><span class="font13"> if he is opposed to your stand on blood. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">nsist</span><span class="font13"> that the s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">urgeon preselect a cooperativ</span><span class="font13">e anesthesi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">olog</span><span class="font13">ist that yo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">u can talk to </span><span class="font13">well in advance of elective surgery. Then there will be time to locate another one if the first one is unwilling to abide by your wishes. Do </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">not let anyone try to talk you out of</span><span class="font13"> this right to be satisfied with the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">anesthes</span><span class="font13">io</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">logist for your surg</span><span class="font13">ery.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> To all of these, you must make clear your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">nonnego-tiable</span><span class="font13"> stand: NO BLOOD. Ask for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">alternative nonblood medical management</span><span class="font13"> of your case. Mention any known alternatives to blood for your situation. If the medical team feels these are not useful in your case, ask them to rese</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">arch other po</span><span class="font13">ssibilities in the medical literature. Assure them you can get them some information if they wish-by your asking your elders to contact the nearest Hospital Liaison Committee.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> Examine care</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">fully the release from liability for</span><span class="font13">m and the consent form the hospital asks you to sign upon admittance. Sometimes right after stating that they will respect your wishes, a succeeding paragraph will declare that the signer agrees that the hospital can administer “lifesaving&quot; treatment when they encounter problems. That could include blood. You </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">have the right</span><span class="font13"> to alte</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">r an</span><span class="font13">y such statements to exclude blood or cross them out alto</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">geth</span><span class="font13">er. Nurses may try to tell you that you cannot do that, but you can! Explain that such </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">a form</span><span class="font13"> is a contract with them and that you cannot sign a contract you do not agree with. If anyone tries to force yon Jo sign against your will, ask to speak </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">to the administrato</span><span class="font13">r and/or the patient representative for that health care center.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> Can you do </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">such thing</span><span class="font13">s? Yes, y</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ou ca</span><span class="font13">n. So </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">be aware </span><span class="font13">of your rights as a patient. These human rights are not left at the front door when you enter a hospital. You do not have to give them up in order to get treatment. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> One such right is called the right of informed^ </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">consent, w</span><span class="font13">hich means that no treatment of any kind can be givef you without your permission. You ca</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">n even </span><span class="font13">refuse all treatment if you wish. Your consent to treatment must follow a clear explanation of what the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">medical team intends to</span><span class="font13"> do. including all risks. Next, they </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span><span class="font13"> tell you abouLany,.alternatives that are available. Then, after you have been informed, you choose what treatment you wish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> To be sure of what you are consenting to, you MUST ask good questions about anything you do not under</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">stand,</span><span class="font13"> especially wh</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">en large words or medical terms ar</span><span class="font13">e </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">used b</span><span class="font13">y the hospital personnel. For example, if a doctor says he would like to use </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">“plasm</span><span class="font13">a,” you could innocently conclude he is referring to a “plasma volume expander,&quot; but not so. Before agreeing, asjo “Is that a component of blood?” About any of his procedures, ask: “Does that treatment involve the use of bl</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ood pro</span><span class="font13">ducts?&quot; If he describes some device'He would like to employ, ask: “I</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">s my blood </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">stored</span><span class="font13"> at any time during the use of this device?&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> But what should you do if you have done ail the above and there is still no coope</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ration</span><span class="font13"> or even some resistance to your position? </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Do not hesitate to a</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">sk fo</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">r help.</span><span class="font13"> Some have, waited-too long to g</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">et help</span><span class="font13"> and put their very lives in d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">anger.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">/ VALUABLE HELP IN A TIME OF NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>23</sup> Note the following procedure for obtaining needed help: (1) As soon as you or a loved one faces either elective or emergency surgery where there is a confrontation because the hospital wants to use blood; or (2) if your medical situation or that of a loved one deteriorates seriously; or (3) if in the case of a child (or an adult), the doctor, a nurse, or an administrator says they are going to get a court order, then:</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">If any medical situation deteriorates seriously to the point where a transfusion is being threatened, check this box as to what you should do;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I. Call elders In your congregation to assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Have elders call the nearest Hospital Liaison Committee if needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">3. The Hospital Liaison Committee can assist you in speaking to doctors and others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">4. The Hospital Liaison Committee can help you contact other doctors for consultation with present surgeons as to alternatives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">5. The Hospital Liaison Committee can also help you get transferred to a more respectful facility for needed treatment.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> CALL YOUR LOCAL ELDERS if you have not already done so. (Indeed, because of our position on blood, it is the course of wisdom to alert our elders anytime we have to go to a health care facility.) Next, if it is deemed necessary, the elders will call the nearest hospital LIAISON COMMITTEE. If you wish, some Hospital Liaison Committee members may come to the hospital at this time to help you.—Isa. 32:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>25</sup> These Hospital Liaison Committee elders know who the c</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ooperative doctors</span><span class="font13"> are in your area and can get you in touch with them and start to line up other doctors or health care centers to assist. If none are available locally, the elders will check with the next nearest committee. And if that is not successful, they will call Hospital Information Services in Brooklyn. They may also be able to arrangeTor consultation </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">with </span><span class="font13">a cooperative doctor who can explain to your present medical team what can be done without blood. Hospital Liaison Committee brothers have been trained to handle such situations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">“Members of the Hospital Liaison Committees are also willing to help you or a relative talk to a doctor or an administrator, but you must request that help. Of course, these brothers cannot make decisions for you, but often they can assist you in considering the Society’s view of matters and alert you to your options medically and legally.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>27</sup> If the medical team is still disinclined to cooperate, talk to the hospital administrator about replacing them with others on his staff who will respect your wishes. If the administrator hesitates to do that and ONLY if you </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">definitely</span><span class="font13"> have another surgeon lined up elsewhere and you can be transferred, then you have the option of giving the administrator a dated and signed written statement naming the uncooperative doctors and stating that they are dismissed from your case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> Can you do that? Yes, you have that right. And if the matter later comes before a judge, your written statement can go a long way toward his recognizing your wishes. It can also possibly open the way ethically for other surgeons now to step in and offer their services to you. And, most important, it can get you the needed medical attention before your condition deteriorates dangerously. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Do not wait too long!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> While we cannot tell anyone to obtain health insurance, we must let you know that we often have serious problems getting an otherwise usually cooperative doctor to treat those who do not have adequate or any medical coverage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">LOADED QUESTIONS TO WATCH OUT FOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>50</sup> You should know that there are some questions that doctors and others pose that arc not always asked with good motive. The one most frequently asked by doctors (and by some judges) is:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">• “Would you rather die (let your child die) than accept a ‘lifesaving blood transfusion’?&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>31</sup> If you say yes, that would be correct in a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">religious </span><span class="font13">sense. But that reply is often misunderstood and at times even produces adverse court decisions. You must remember that you are not in the ministry in this situation. Rather, you are talking about needed medical treatment. Hence, you must adapt to your audience, medical or legal.—Ps. 39:1; Col. 4:5,6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>32</sup> To a doctor, a judge, or a hospital administrator, “yes” can mean you want to be a martyr or want to sacrifice your child for your faith. Telling them about your strong faith in the resurrection </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">in this situation </span><span class="font13">will not usually help. They will brand you a religious fanatic, unable to make rational decisions when life is at stake. In the case of children, they will see you as a negligent parent who refuses so-called “lifesaving&quot; medical treatment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>33</sup> But you are NOT denying medical treatment as such. You simply differ with the doctor as to WHAT KIND of treatment. This position will often change the whole picture for them and you. Besides, it is misleading for them to make it appear as if blood is safe and is the ONLY “lifesaving” treatment. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font13"> pages 7-22.) So you must make that point very clear. How can you do it? You might answer:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">• “Ido not want (Ido not want my child ) to die. If</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">I wanted ( wanted my child ) to die, I would have stayed home. But I came here to get medical treatment so as to (to have my child) live. What I want is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">alternative nonblood medical management of my ( my child’s) case. There are alternatives available.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>M</sup> Several other questions often asked by doctors or judges are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">• “What will happen to you if a transfusion is forced by court order? Will you be held responsible?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">• “Will accepting or having a transfusion forced on you cause you to be put out of your religion or be denied eternal life? How will you be viewed by your congregation?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>33</sup> One sister responded to a judge that in such a case she would not be responsible for what he decided. While correct from one point of view, the judge took it to mean that since she would not be held responsible, then he would take the responsibility for her. He ordered a transfusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>36</sup> You must understand that in asking these questions, some are usually looking for a way around your refusal to accept blood. Do not inadvertently give it to them! So how would we avoid that misunderstanding? You could reply:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">• “If blood is forced on me in any way, it would be the same to me as being raped. I would suffer the emotional and spiritual consequences of that unwanted attack on me for the rest of my life. I would resist with all my strength such a violation of my body without my consent. I would make every effort to prosecute my attackers just as I would in a case of rape.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>37</sup> The strong, graphic impression must be made that a forced transfusion is to us a repugnant violation of our bodies. It is no casual matter. So hold your ground. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Make it clear you want alternative nonblood medical management.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WILL YOU DO TO BE READY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>38</sup> We have reviewed some things that you need to do to protect yourself and your family from an unwanted blood transfusion. (Later, we hope to provide more details on handling problems that arise when infants and children are threatened with transfusions.) We have also seen what the Society has lovingly done to provide help in a time of need. What must you do with this information to be sure you are ready to face a faith-challenging medical situation?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">First:</span><span class="font13"> Have a family discussion to rehearse these matters and to work out what you will say and do, especially in an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Next:</span><span class="font13"> See that you have all the documents you need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Then:</span><span class="font13"> Make it a matter of serious prayer to Jehovah to back you up in your firm resolve to ‘keep abstaining from blood.’ Obeying his law on blood assures us of his favor for endless life.—Acts 15:29; Prov. 27:11,12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has made numerous provisions for training us to be effective in performing our personal ministry. By using w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hat he has provided</span><span class="font13">, ‘pur very steps have been made ready.7 (Ps. 37:23) As an example, for nearly 50 years, the Theocratic </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ministr</span><span class="font13">y School has been giving progressive training in the art of speaking and teaching. This has been supplemented by the weekly Service Meeting, with its practical talks, demonstrations, and discussion periods.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We benefit from regular visits by circuit overseers- The service overseer visits each book </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">study g</span><span class="font13">roup and provides loving encouragement to help improve our abilities in the public ministry. Along with all of this, each time we meet for field service, ten minutes of practical instruction gives encouragement and useful suggestions for that day. (Heb. 10:23-25) Such arrangements through his organization demonstrate Jehovah’s loving concern for those he has commissioned to preach the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Youthful publishers and newer ones need regular </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">persona</span><span class="font13">l assistance in the public ministry. While all of us can offer help from time to time, the principal responsibility falls upon the parentsand those who are conducting Bible studies with such ones. (Gal. 6:6; Eph. 6:4) Effectiveness.in using the Bible does not come automatically with the passage of time and a measure of experience. Rather, there is need for systematic loving personal assistance and training.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">joyful Christian </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">fellowshi</span><span class="font13">p.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Regular district .conventions are arranged throughout the earth each year for the benefit of all the brothers. Then at times special conventions are held in certain regions. This provides an opportunity to show the international aspect of the organization and to give a greater witness. In 1989 three specia</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">l convention</span><span class="font13">s were held in Poland. How thrilling the reports we received regarding those special conventions!</span></p></li></ul>

Review the Topic for Conversation. Help those qualified to participate in the ministry to develop a simple presentation. Perhaps they can use just one of the suggested scriptures until they gain greater experience and confidence. While working together in the service, take time between doors to give commendation and provide kindly suggestions on how to improve. Emphasize the need to maintain a prayerful attitude at all times.—Eph. 6:18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Although many regular pioneers and other experienced publishers share in the ministry mainly on weekdays, what a fine thing it is when these effective publishers can rearrange their schedules so as to be supportive of weekend field service from </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">time to </span><span class="font13">time. Such personal sacrifice on their part will be greatly appreciated by others who would like to improve by working along with them in the ministry.—Eccl. 4:9,10.</span></p></li>

Many of us received encouragement and training from more experienced publishers or pioneers. Our present skill and increased joy in the ministry are a direct result of that aid. (Prov. 27:17: Acts 20:35) May our appreciation for what Jehovah has done for us through active training in the ministry move us to make ourselves available to assist others to become more skillful in using Jehovah’s Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">ventions. In time it may be possible for more brothers_to attend one of these. However, in order to accomplish the purpose of the special conventions and have everything take place in an orderly manner, the ar; rangement is for designatedbranches each to select a limited number of delegates to attend a particular convention. This provides for a bala</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nced </span><span class="font13">representation of the international brotherhood for the encouragement of the locaTbrothers and for the effect of a witness to all observers. Of course, this means that not all who apply and are recommended bythe local Congregation Service Committee can be selected as delegates. Some may be disappointed in not being selected, but we believe that all will understand the important reasons for such an arrangement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In a Prayerful Manner</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote encouragingly to the Philippians, “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (Phil. 4:13) We also need to rely wTidlly on Jehovah for strength-fopresent the good news boldly. How can we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus stressed the need for us “always to pray and not to give up.” (Luke 18:1) Paul exhorted, “Pray incessantly.” (1 Thess. 5:17) Yes, strength comes from prayer. We need to present the good news in a prayerful manner. We may pray for opppr; tunities to witness to otherSj_for wisdom and discernment in the house-to-house work, and for success in reaching the hearts of our Bible students. Since there is an urgent need to get the Kingdom, good.ne.w5 preached before the end comes, we also need to pray for the advancement of Kingdom interests worldwide. (Matt. 24:14) We must ‘remain awake’ in prayer in order to avoid spiritual drowsiness and increase our appreciation for the privilege of speaking to others about Jehovah’s purposes.—Col. 4:2; w62 p. 497.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ON BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Why is prayer so important when conducting a Bible </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">study</span><span class="font13">? Starting the study with prayer puts us in the right frame of mind, and it helps the student to realize the importance of what is being said. He learns ToTook to Jehovah for direction. The student also learns how to pray by our example.—Luke 11:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What are some things that would be appropriate to +neludedn-prayors at home Bible studies? Jesus’ model prayer and Paul’s prayer in behalf of the Philippians are excellent examples. (Matt. 6:9-13; Phil. 1:9-11) Our prayers need not be lengthy, but they should deal with specifte things. It is important that we include appropriate expressions of praise to Jehovah</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Word of God &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When directing attention to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Trinity</span><span class="font13"> brochure, you might say: “Many sincere people have been taught to believe in the Trinity, yet they And the concept very difficult to comprehend. This brochure examines the Trinity in great detail from a historical viewpoint and in the light of what the Bible says. Would you like to read it?” As for using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!” </span><span class="font13">brochure, you may catch the house-for his innumerable excellent works. We can express recognition of his greatness, majesty, and perfect qualities. (Ps. 145:3-5) Mentioning the Bible student by name, perhaps acknowledging his circumstances, and praying that he’ make spiritual progress would be'beneffcial. As he advances, we can ask Jehovah’s blessing upon his efforts 'to attend meetthgs and to share with others the truth he is learning. Include petitions for Jehovah’s blessing on the worldwide preaching work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> All of Jehovah’s people are our fellow workers. (1 Cor. 3:9) Therefore, when secular authorities seek to interfere with the preaching of the good news, we are moved to p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ray </span><span class="font13">“concerning kings and all those who are m.high station.” For what purpose? (j*In order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” (1 Tim. 2:1, 2) Such prayers are actually in favor of our brothers around the world. We pray that the author-itiesTnay be favorably disposed toward our work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By means of </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">prayer</span><span class="font13">, we can request strength for dur brothers who preach under difficult circumstances and for those who may be spiritually sick, that they can have a fuller share in the ministry. (2 Thess. 3:1, 2) It is also good to pray for congregation elders, traveling overseers, and the Governing Body—alToT “those who are working hard among you.” —1 Thess. 5:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> At all times we need to cast out. anxieties upon Jehovah. (Ps. 55:22; 1 Pet. 5:7) We are assured that no matter what it is we ask in harmony with his will, he will hear us. (1 John 5:14) Therefore, if we pray for Jehovah’s assistance in fully accomplishing our ministry, we should be confident that he will listen and make our way successful.—2Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> During November, be alert to opportunities to encourage people to read the Bible. Be quick to follow up with return visits on those who express interest. Help them cultivate a genuine appreciation for the power of God’s Word. By applying its principles in their lives, they will gain lasting benefits both now and in the life that is to come.—1 Tim. 4:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* India reported a new peak of 10,272 publishers for June. This is 17 percent over last year’s average. There were also new peaks in regular pioneers, return visits, and Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Conventions </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">given, the Society requests that everyone cooperate with the arrangements outlined for special conventions. If some brothers make their own arrangements to attend a special convention, even though they have not been s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">electe</span><span class="font13">d as delegates, it creates problems. The number of delegates sent from selected countries to a special convention is determined by the Society. This is necessary in order to avoid overcrowding at the convention facilities, it facilities were to be overtaxed, it would hinder the smooth running of the convention and would not make a favorable impression on local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Selected delegates should keep in mind that their purpose in attending the convention ’is to advance Kingdom interests. This purpose is more readily accomplished when all delegates cooperate with traveland other arrangements made by the Society and'<sup>1</sup> do not make independent arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>s</sup>This year special conventions have been held in Berlin, Germany, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. In December a special convention will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. During January 1991, special conventions will be held in the Fa</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">r Ea</span><span class="font13">st. The three locations will be Manjla, the Philippines JaipgL Taiwan; and Bangkok, Thailand. De</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">legates have</span><span class="font13"> already been selected for these conventions. Other special conventions for the summer of 1991 have been announced through the congregation, and Congregation Service Committees have approved dedicated and baptized members of the congregation and sent in applications for them. It is expected that all select</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed delegates w</span><span class="font13">il</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">fmake ev</span><span class="font13">ery effor</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t to give a </span><span class="font13">jine witness, in company with delegates attending from other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Whether selected as delegates to special conventions or attending local conventions, may our daily conduct give evidence of our whole-souled devotion and our sincere desire to honor Jehovah in all we do!</span></p>

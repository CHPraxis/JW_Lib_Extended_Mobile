<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Worship Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 3:4—He is our Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 4:11 —He is worthy of our worship.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Honor the Creator of All Things</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During the 19th century, Satan hatched an insidious scheme to blind mankind—the theory of &quot;evolution. (2 Cor. 4:4) ThiS theory.is a blatant de</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nial of the Bible account</span><span class="font12"> of creation and of man’s fall into sin. It would make Jesus’ </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ransom s</span><span class="font12">acrifice and the Bible teachings on the Kingdom and everlasting life meaningless. Moreover, the evolution theory paves the. way for violenc</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">e and war,</span><span class="font12"> sexual immorality, and all kinds of lawlessness. Who will warn mankind about the dangers of this deadly teaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> During the month of September, we will be doing so, since we will be busy proclaiming Jehovah’s creatorship. In the house-to-house ministry, in street work, during rest breaks on the secular job, and at school, we will be featuring the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font12"> We desire everyone to know how the evolution theory dishonors mankind’s Creator.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GIVE AN EFFECTIVE WITNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When witnessing informally or from house-to-house, you may wish to start a conversation by making reference to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">perio</span><span class="font12">dic news items regarding the strong opinions held by some people on the subject of evolution. Numerous expressions have been made regarding the question as to whether the theory of evolution should be taught in the public schools. Although a person may have read or heard much about related arguments and even heated debates on this subject, he will no doubt find quite interesting a straightforward statement in the Bible that has a direct bearing on the subject. Then refer to what is stated at Hebrews 3:4. Read the text and comment briefly on it.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Get Acquainted With New Convention Releases</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Two new releases, a book and a brochure, have been added to our rich supply of spiritual food. Released at the “Pure Language” District Conventions, these new publications are sure to have a powerful impact on our field ministry in addition to helping all of us to speak the pure language more distinctly.—Zeph. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When releasing the new brochure, the convention speaker said: “In the field ministry—house to house, on return visits, and during Bible studies— we are often asked why we will not take blood. To help you to answer that question, it is a joy to release a new publication. It is this magazine-size brochure, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?&quot;</span><span class="font12"> Have you made the vital information in this brochure your own by reading it carefully? It is important for you to do so in order to strengthen</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If the person appears to be somewhat religiously inclined, you could mention that religious persons as well as those who believe in evolution often give cre</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">dit to an imperson</span><span class="font12">al “</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Nature</span><span class="font12">” or </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">a personified &quot;Mo</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">her Na</span><span class="font12">ture” as being the creative force behind' all the marvelous things we see about us. But the Bible does not leave unidentified our Grand Benefactor and the Creator of this marvelous universe. Attention can be drawn to Revelation </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">4:11</span><span class="font12">. After reading the scripture, the person may wish to express himself regarding the matter. You can tie in a specific point or two from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book and, if appropriate, encourage him to read it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AT SCHOOL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As a new school year opens, all you young servants of Jehovah will want to review your </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book and consider ways to interest fellow students as well as your teachers in it. Some have found that just leavin</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">g the pub</span><span class="font12">lication on thei</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">r desk in</span><span class="font12">vites discussions. Others have approached t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">each</span><span class="font12">ers and school administrators on th'e subject of creation and have been able to distribute a number of books that way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> All of us rejoice in the prospect of living in a world where everyone will honor Jehovah. In the Revelation, John saw magnificent spirit creatures bow before Jehovah and proclaim, “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.” (Rev. 4:11) May we echo those words in our ministry during September!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">your own faith and to be prepared to help others understand the Christian view of blood.—Acts 15:28, 29.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The well-documented information in the brochure will further equip you to explain your stand and wishes to any doctor. However, this new brochure is not primarily for doctors or lawyers. It is designed and specifically written for the public. You can see how its twofold purpose makes it a most valuable instrument for our use at this time. It is suggested that you carry one or two copies of it with you in the field. Make full use of this valuable information for your personal benefit and for helping others to show proper respect for blood.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A NEW BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

Studying it will give us a clearer understanding of other religions and their historical background.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Appreciating Our Pioneers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Fellow workers for the Kingdom of God strengthen one another. (Col. 4:11) When we consider that the primary work of the Christian congregation is to preach the good news, there are compelling reasons to appreciate the full-time workers in our midst.—Mark 13:10; Rom. 16:2; Phil. 4:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In a direct way, pioneers build up the congregation by working with less experienced publishers in various features of the preaching work. This includes magazine witnessing, preparing for and making return visits, and starting and effectively conducting home Bible studies. In addition, pioneers can set an example in courageously witnessing informally. Their support of midweek group witnessing arrangements affords them opportunity to be of assistance to others. Their positive influence in the field can be felt especially when pioneers support field service on the weekend, a time when most other publishers are able to share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Pioneers help congregations in thoroughly and frequently covering the territory. This enables people to become better acquainted with our message and to feel more at ease when we visit them because they know who we are. The many hours pioneers spend in the territory leaving literature with interested persons and cultivating the interest—in ef-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Alert to Start Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Starting and conducting home Bible studies is part of our commission as Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Matt. 28: 19, 20) Therefore, will you be one of God’s fellow workers in doing this? (1 Cor. 3:9) What a privilege it is to help others come to know the greatest Personage in the universe!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> With so many problems connected with fast-changing world events, many honesthearted individuals are looking for answers as to why these things are happening. Long ago Jehovah provided the answers to their questions. When sincere ones are instructed in the Word of God, they are comforted. Hence, we need to be alert to opportunities to start Bible studies.—Prov. 3:27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BE ALERT TO OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Have you considered starting a Bible study with a close relative or an acquaintance who is not in the truth? Knowing them will give you an edge in using discernment as to the appropriate time to discuss the matter with them. Have in mind that a wellfeet, planting and watering seeds of truth—can only lead to a more productive territory.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE CONGREGATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Many have been encouraged to enter full-time service because their heart was touched by the zeal and enthusiasm of faithful pioneers. One sister had been hesitant about becoming a regular pioneer because there were none in the congregation. But when encouraged by the circuit overseer, she went ahead and enrolled. Others soon followed, and that congregation now has a sizable number of zealous pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There may be times when the elders will ask a pioneer to assist a person who has become irregular or inactive. This assistance could include conducting a Bible study with the individual. The pioneer’s faith and zeal could thus contribute to rekindling the person’s love for the truth and help reactivate him to work at fulfilling the obligations of his dedication. —IThess. 5:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGE THE PIONEERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The pioneers, while doing much to encourage others, themselves need encouragement in order to continue joyful in their service. (Rom. 1:12) Do you speak positively about the pioneer ministry? When did you last commend a pioneer for his or her work and self-sacrificing spirit? Pioneers especially appreciate having </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">chosen question or a word at the right time may awaken their interest in the truth. When an individual’s curiosity is aroused, fruitful discussions often follow, and a Bible study may be started.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In many cases the fine conduct of a Christian mate has served to open the way for an unbeliever to come into the truth. (1 Pet. 3:1, 2) Unbelieving mates and other unbelieving family members generally appreciate it when they are recognized and respected by members of the congregation. Showing personal interest in them can go a long way toward building friendly relations. By working together with the mate or family member in the truth, you may be able to establish a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> While engaging in the house-to-house work, we may try to start a Bible study on the initial call. How can this be done? Some publishers have had success in doing this when the householder is asking questions </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page if, col.</span><span class="font12"> 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> No other journals in history have had such an impact for good on the lives of people as have </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Every issue is full of life-giving spiritual food. The results of in-depth research presented with strong Scriptural support impresses the message of truth on our minds and hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> through its pages, explains Bible teachings and calls our attention to the fulfillment of Bible prophecies. It encourages all who are spiritually hungry to transform their mind and to put on the new personality. (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4: 22-24) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> alerts its readers to significant happenings in the world. Its striking illustrations depicting the marvels of creation stir interest in the new world and deepen appreciation for the loving Creator. .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT LIKE SECULAR MAGAZINES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Secular magazines do not show people how to enjoy satisfying lives in this world. They offer no hope for the future and fail to teach people how to get everlasting life. Those worldly magazines are designed to promote the things of the world. What a contrast with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!—</span><span class="font12">1 John 2:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> No doubt you yourself feel a deep sense of gratitude for every issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!—</span><span class="font12">magazines that contain sweet fragrances of truth from “the faithful steward.” (Luke 12:42) What can we do to improve our placement of magazines and thus help more to benefit from our journals?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DOING OUR PART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Before we can properly encourage honesthearted ones to read our magazines, we need to know what each journal contains. This calls for us to read each issue before using it in the ministry. Being thoroughly familiar with its contents, we can use the avenues of the house-to-house ministry, street work, and informal</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">someone to work with in field service during those hours of the day when few publishers are out. Can you accompany the pioneers and perhaps spend longer hours in support of the preaching work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> How else can you encourage the pioneers? Besides giving commendation, you can express your appreciation for such hard workers in a tangible way by sharing a meal with them, witnessing for magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Furthermore, by having the current magazines with us while shopping, riding public transportation, at school, at our place of employment, or wherever we go, we will be able to seize appropriate opportunities to witness. A well-chosen introduction from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book coupled with a point from one of the articles may arouse a person’s desire to read our magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Although our conversations may be brief when offering the magazines, we do not have to limit our discussion to just a minute or so. We want to take time to determine whether the person is really interested in the message and if he will read the magazine. If questions arise, we should always endeavor to answer the inquiries by making full use of our Bible or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book. By being ready to defend our faith, we can reap marvelous blessings.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> If the individual agrees to read the magazines, we can speak about the nature of our work and how these magazines are published twice a month as part of a worldwide Bible educational work. The information on page 2 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> or page 4 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> explains this very nicely. Since the contents of the next issue are always listed, we can propound related questions or call attention to the upcoming articles. This may whet the appetite of the person and move him to express a desire to obtain that issue when it comes out. This could be the start of a magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> As the end of this system draws near, may we quicken our pace to help honesthearted ones escape from Babylon the Great and come into the truth. (Rev. 18:4) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> play a powerful part in our worldwide Bible educational work. We are thankful that Jehovah has provided them for our use in the ministry. May Jehovah continue to bless our careful and intensive use of these journals!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">voluntarily assisting them with their travel expenses, and in other ways supporting them as you are able. —Compare 1 Thessalonians 5:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> With elders and ministerial servants taking the lead in the congregation, pioneers and publishers will give full support to well-organized arrangements for service. All of us will thus be using what gifts we have in “ministering to one another.”—1 Pet. 4:10,11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Canada surpassed the 100,000 mark In total publishers during April, with a new publisher peak of 100,368.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Cape Verde Islands had a peak of 410 publishers in April for a 19-percent increase over last year's average. Congregation publishers averaged 14.5 hours, and a peak of 856 Bible studies was reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ April was an outstanding month in Honduras. They reached new peaks in publishers, pioneers, hours, magazines, return visits, and Bible studies. Three new congregations were formed also. The 5,706 publishers conducted 9,614 home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ South Africa had a new peak of 48,590 publishers in April. They also had an outstanding new peak of 49,967 Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">that can be answered directly from a publication. If the person agrees to read the literature or if he invites us in, we can seize the opportunity to continue the discussion and perhaps demonstrate a study. Use your judgment on how long to stay on the initial call. It may be beneficial to return at a later hour or a later date to continue the discussion. On future calls, you may wish to continue discussing the subject you introduced on the first call. Or you could take up a question raised at the conclusion of the previous visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INFORMAL OCCASIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Informal witnessing can be another fruitful avenue in our efforts to start home Bible studies. In our dayto-day activities, we come in contact with many individuals who may wish to study. To aid us in being effective, we can use some of the tested introductions from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book to start conversations. And do not hold back from offering a Bible study initially because the person lives elsewhere and we may not have the opportunity to conduct the study ourselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Be alert to occasions for informal witnessing, and be prepared by carrying a good supply of tracts and magazines that will heighten the listener’s interest in the truth. (Eccl. 11:1) If an individual shows interest in the truth and is not in your congregation’s territory, obtain his address and other necessary information and pass this on to the congregation where he lives so that someone can properly care for him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> The disciple-making work is not for just a few. It is for all in the congregation. Keeping in mind that it is a Christian commission to become disciple makers will encourage us to be alert to opportunities to start Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>

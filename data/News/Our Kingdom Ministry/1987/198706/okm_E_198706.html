<p><span class="font14">’ Jeho<sup>v</sup>ah’s people have gladly followed Jesus’ command to “make disciples of people of all the nations.&quot; (Matt. 28:19) Over the years, we have used v</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">arious means</span><span class="font14"> to get penpip in-t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ereste</span><span class="font14">iTrn~ theTTingdom message.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Now that I have made arrangements for my vacation, how can I locate the nearest Kingdom Hall?” Does that question come up at times when you plan a vacation? Many find that some of their most memorable experiences on vacation are enjoyed when they attend meetings and share in field service with the local congregation.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people eagerly look forward to a future when we will be under God's Kingdom rule only, free from the burdens of this system of things. What sheer pleasure we will experience in waking up each morning to contemplate the prospect of spending all of our time, energy, and strength directly in Jehovah’s service, transforming the earth into a paradise, instructing resurrected ones in Jehovah’s ways, or engaging in other worthwhile theocratic activity!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Even now, Jehovah’s people in ever-increasing numbers are getting a foretaste of the joys of serving Jehovah full-time. In recent years, many have found that their circumstances allow for taking up the pioneer work. These have reasoned that in this way they are able to be more fully occupied in Jehovah’s service. They have offered themselves willingly and are seeking to have a greater share in Kingdom service during this period of ingathering.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESSIVELY EXPANDING YOUR MINISTRY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In anticipation of the greater activity we hope to share in, many are making wise use of stepping-stones that progressively enable them to expand their Kingdom service. One such stepping-stone is the auxiliary pioneer service. Many who have taken up this activity have been richly blessed in seeing “that Jehovah is good.” (Ps. 34:8) They have been moved to submit a second auxiliary pioneer application with a little check in the box indicating that not been in that area before? Some local </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">newspapers</span><span class="font14"> give the Kingdom ffall address along with meeting times. The local t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">elephone directory </span><span class="font14">may have a listirig'un’der “Jehovah’s Witnesses” or “Kingdom Hall.” Otherwise, you may find a </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">policemanpostman</span><span class="font14">. or other knowledgeable </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">resident</span><span class="font14"> who can either direct you to the Kingdom Hall or assist you in contacting brothers living in the community. It is a good idea to l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ook up</span><span class="font14"> the congregation as s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oon as you arriv</span><span class="font14">e in the area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Meeting times are about the same in most places. However, keep in mind that Kingdom Halls in some areas may have meetings in different</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font14"> 4, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font14"> 2) they wish to serve continuously as an auxiliary pioneer until further notice. Getting experience at this level of activity has helped many prepare for regular pioneering. The transition is an easy one, they have found. Could you auxiliary pioneer in June, July, and August, progressively using such activity as a stepping-stone to starting regular pioneer service in September? —Compare Malachi 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The summer months offer splendid opportunities for baptized youths to expand their ministry. What activity could you young ones engage in this summer that would be more beneficial than a month or two in the auxiliary pioneer service? What an enriching experience this could be! There is much joy to be found in sharing with others the precious truths you have learned. You can open up to other sheeplike ones the same bright hope for the future that you have. Your young friends in the congregation who are not yet dedicated will be encouraged by your example, and perhaps some of them will be moved to ‘roll their works upon Jehovah’ and have their plans for the future become “firmly established.”—Prov. 16:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Those youths who are not yet baptized are warmly invited to consider how they can expand their Christian activity. While they may work most often with their parents, at times they could also work with zealous responsible youths or older persons. Think what a source of mutual refreshment and encouragement there can be as young and old accompany one another in the ministry!—Rom. 1:12; Isa. 40:30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s blessing enriches us spiritually and moves us to give our best in his service. May the effort that we each put forth according to our ability and our circumstances be pleasing to Jehovah as we prepare ourselves to serve him eternally.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In Evening Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah speeds up the ingathering work, more congregations are being formed everywhere, publishers and pioneers are increasing in numbers, and many publishers are spending more time in the field ministry. In some areas it may well be that there is very little territory to be worked. Publishers may be calling at the same homes quite often. However, it is also observed that many of the people are not at home when we call at their doors during the daytime, and some rarely have opportunity to hear the Kingdom message even though we are working the territory regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> You will be encouraged to know that this situation is changing in many congregations where the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">pyb,-</span><span class="font14">lishers have begun t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o concentrate on </span><span class="font14">evening witnessing. Publishers have reportecTHnding someone at almost every home in certain territories, whereas earlier in the day very few were home. It is also reported that in general people appear to be relaxed toward the end of the day and are more inclined to listen when approached with the Kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BE REASONABLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> There are certain points we need to keep in mind if we are to be successful in evening witnessing. People may be somewhat apprehensive about unexpected and unknown visj-fdrs, especially after dark. Thought should be given-to how we will approach the householders. A review of what is stated on page 9 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book can be helpful. We need to convey genuine c</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">once</span><span class="font14">rn for the welfare of people. This can encourage the householders to fe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">el at eas</span><span class="font14">e and to express themselves openly. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book also reminds us to observe for</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">malitie</span><span class="font14">s that are customary arid that are expected of visitors. This would include properly introducing ourselves and observing local customs in this regard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Uninvited c</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">alls at inap</span><span class="font14">propriate householder’s security measures should be respected. This might include using an intercom or speaking to a person through the door and allow</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing him to see you</span><span class="font14"> through a peephole in the door.—See </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font14"> 11/85 pp. 4-5 pars. 23, 24, 31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We sh</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ould be cautious, reason</span><span class="font14">able, </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">and discreet at all times</span><span class="font14">. There may be areas in our territory that are considered more dangerous than others. We would be wise to take the needed </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">precaution</span><span class="font14">s when working such areas.—Jas. 3:17; see </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font14"> 4/85 p.8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> There are a number of reasons why </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">evening witnessing</span><span class="font14"> could be effective m your congregation.

Many householders who are not at home during the daytime or on weekends</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font14">may likely be reached when the territory is worked in the evening. Some of the p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ublishers who have difficulty </span><span class="font14">geftmg out in servi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ce on weekends</span><span class="font14"> . may be able to spe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">nd an h</span><span class="font14">our or two each week in evening house-to-house work. Regular and auxiliary </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">pioneer</span><span class="font14">s can have more opportunities to work in the field service with congregation p</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ublisher</span><span class="font14">s. Some have arranged to conduct a home Bible study in the evening, following an hour or so in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Long summer evenings are par-ticuFafly Appropriate ‘for various forms of field service and especially for making house-to-house calls. However, evening witnessing </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">need </span><span class="font14">not </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">be limited to daylight hours</span><span class="font14"> during summer months.

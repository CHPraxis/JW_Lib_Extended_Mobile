<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> It is always pleasant to remember things that brought us joy and resulted in personal benefit. How much more so is this true when we recall getting a new convention release, knowing it was especially provided to enhance our spirituality!—2 Pet. 3:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> For many of us, the present service campaign of offering the outstanding pocket-size book releases from previous years has served as a reminder of the value of these publications. Those publishers and newly interested ones who have not read these books will certainly want to obtain personal copies. All of us can feel confident that getting these older publications into the hands of the people in our territory will do much to stimulate further interest in the Kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PAST RELEASES WE CAN USE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In 1974 many of us rejoiced to receive </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life All There Is? </span><span class="font13">How good it was to see coverage of topics such as the soul, the rich man and Lazarus, the fire of Gehenna, and the prospects for billions to be raised from the dead! Indeed, this was a valuable addition to our theocratic library.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Another interesting release was received at the “Joyful Workers”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths—Reach Out for Worthwhile Goals</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What are your goals in life? Many young people have not set any spiritual goals. But is it not good to experience the feeling that comes from setting Christian goals and then successfully achieving them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Many of our youths have seen the futility of reaching for materialistic goals, including those that involve advanced secular education. They have concluded that such goals are not worth risking the potential dangers to be encountered. At best, benefits from worldly achievements can last only as long as this system, which is now hastening toward its complete end. However, theocratic goals, pursued with the enlightenment of divine education, will be personally satisfying now and lead ultimately to eternal salvation.—Eccl. 12:1,13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC GOALS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As young people today, do you search for worthwhile knowledge? At Proverbs 2:1-5 we are counseled District Assemblies in 1977. It was entitled </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Incoming World Government—God’s Kingdom.</span><span class="font13"> What a marvelous treasure this book has proved to be! As stated on the publisher’s page, the book is “dedicated to the God whose happy time has come to replace man’s disastrous rulership of himself with the righteous government for which heartsick people of all races have longed.” The theme of the Bible, God’s Kingdom, is developed throughout the book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Since we consider these publications an important part of our own theocratic library, we should make a special effort to continue offering them in the field ministry during February. When presenting </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Is This Life AU There Is?</span><span class="font13"> you might say: “With people everywhere facing so many problems, what is your outlook for the future? [Allow for response.] There is a solution we can count on.” Then you might read the scriptures in the current Topic for Conversation and refer to points in an appropriate chapter, such as 15,16,17, or 18. The book can be offered for 50e.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Perhaps you will be offering </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Incoming World Government—God’s (Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font13"> 1) to “find the very knowledge of God.” You can never hope to acquire knowledge of God unless you study his Word. By regular personal study you impress more deeply on your mind and heart the Scriptural material designed to draw you closer to Jehovah. You will learn more and remember more. This will help you to be better equipped to make decisions when faced with important issues. As you apply yourself, your reading ability should improve, as well as your grammar and vocabulary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> You cannot accomplish this all in one day. Developing spiritual maturity takes time and patience. But if you set individual goals and make steady progress, spiritual maturity can be attained.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Helps Us to &quot;Make Sure of the More Important Things&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do you agree that as Christians we have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord&quot;? (1 Cor. 15:58) No doubt you have a full schedule of theocratic activities, including personal and family study, attendance at Christian meetings, and the preaching and teaching of the good news. Besides all of this, you may also be caring for various matters of a secular nature. Sometimes unnecessary activities can begin to take much time or drain one’s resources. Increased responsibilities may arise, requiring more efficient use of our time and assets. At such times it is wise for a family to consider what can be done to “make sure of the more important things.”—Phil. 1:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> There is a similar situation in the household of God due to our rapidly growing worldwide family. (1 Tim. 3:15) The Governing Body has found it necessary and wise to implement a simplification program. Measures are being taken so that the organization can “stretch out,” as it were, to accommodate the many new ones coming in and at the same time continue to provide all of us with vital spiritual things.—Isa. 54:1-3; Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The insert of the August 1986 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> explained how a simplified reporting arrangement for regular pioneers would begin operation in September 1986. We are happy to report that this has had a fine effect here at the Brooklyn branch office. The new arrangement has already eliminated considerable work for some of our office staff, allowing them to care for other necessary matters.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNUAL CIRCUIT ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> By means of a letter from the Society, all congregations have learned that starting September 1987 each circuit will have one circuit assembly a year. This adjustment will accomplish many beneficial things. Those circuits using Assembly Halls that had full schedules will not be having a circuit assembly within just a few weeks of their assigned district convention. The Assembly Halls will have some open weeks during which necessary maintenance can be done. There will be time available between circuit assemblies for conducting the Pioneer Service School and also the Kingdom Ministry School from time to time. Circuit overseers and congregation elders will have some additional time to care for other theocratic responsibilities. It will be possible for the district overseer, after serving the circuit during the assembly week(s), to spend a week with the circuit overseer as he visits a congregation. This arrangement will be beneficial in other ways, too, not only here in the United States but in many other countries.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL ASSEMBLY DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> For a number of years now, about half of the circuits in this country have held a special event each year, featuring a speaker from Brooklyn Bethel. On such occasions a two- or three-hour program has been presented. The Society is adjusting this arrangement so that beginning September 1987, it will be possible for each circuit or section of a circuit to have a special assembly day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The circuit overseer will advise congregations in his circuit of the date scheduled by the Society for this event. This will be a time during the year that will not be too close to the date of your regular circuit assembly or the district convention. Circuits that are assigned to an Assembly Hall will be able to use such facilities on either a Saturday or a Sunday. This means that, wherever possible, two different circuits or two sections of the same circuit will be able to use the Assembly Hall on one weekend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Where circuits do not have an Assembly Hall available, all sections of a circuit may come together for a special assembly day if this is convenient for all the congregations and if large enough facilities are available. In some of the larger metropolitan areas where no Assembly Hall is available, two or, at the most, three circuits may meet together for this purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> The annual special assembly day will prove to be another fine occasion for the brothers to receive wholesome spiritual instruction and to encourage one another. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Scriptural information that is needed for our times will be presented by assigned speakers under the direction of the Society. In many cases, it will be possible for certain qualified brothers from Brooklyn Bethel to share in the program along with local traveling overseers and other qualified elders in the circuit. Also, you will be glad to know that on these occasions arrangements will be made for a baptism. Thus, there will still be three opportunities each year for those who make a dedication to Jehovah God and who complete a review of the questions in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font13"> book with the elders to be baptized.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIMPLIFIED FEEDING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> We appreciate the fine labors of love that thousands of our brothers and sisters have performed over the years to provide cafeteria meals at circuit assemblies. However, in accord with the principles of ‘making sure of the more important things' and keeping a ‘simple eye,’ it seems good to begin a simplified feeding arrangement at circuit assemblies and special assemblies, starting September 1987.—Phil. 1:10; Matt. 6:22.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> The simplified feeding arrangement will be similar to the way things have been handled at district conventions. A simplified menu and serving procedure will eliminate the need for thousands of brothers to spend many hours making purchases of a variety of food items, preparing the food before the sessions, and then cleaning up afterward. Most of these brothers have already worked secularly during the week. Would it not be better for them if they could spend this time on the weekend concentrating on spiritual things by being in attendance to hear the program? Yes! All of us need the spiritual refreshment in order not to tire out in doing Jehovah’s will.—Heb. 12:3; Isa. 40:29-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> On the holy convention days during ancient Israel’s annual festivals, the people were to do no laborious work except for festival preparation, including the food for those gathered. But in this matter of food, Jehovah specifically stated: “Only what every soul </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">needs</span><span class="font13"> to eat, that alone may be done for you.” (Ex. 12:16; Lev. 23:6-8; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">ad </span><span class="font13">pp. 375, 574) The basic purpose of those ancient assemblies was the same as it is for our gatherings today, namely, to focus our attention on Jehovah God and be edified spiritually with the least amount of distraction possible. Truly these are “the more important things.” Jesus’ words addressed to Martha on a particular occasion reflect the same thought. Referring to material provisions, he said: “A few things, though, are needed, or just one.” (Luke 10:38-42) We are confident that the simplified feeding arrangement will help all of us to make sure that we accomplish the purpose of our assembling.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN YOU SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> You can see from the above information that Jehovah’s organization is being streamlined for more efficient movement during this very busy time of the end. “The time left is reduced,” and hundreds of thousands are joining us in the race for everlasting life in a righteous new system of things. (1 Cor. 7:29) Just as a runner in a race strips down to the bare essentials, it behooves all of us to consider what we can do as individuals to simplify our life. Paul urges: “Let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.” (Heb. 12:1) With respect to material things or secular pursuits, we can ask: ‘Is this something that I need in order to keep living and serving Jehovah? Will it help me to be a better servant of Jehovah, or will it slow me down?'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> If we follow the good example of Jehovah’s organization by using our time and resources in the best way possible to advance Kingdom interests and glorify Jehovah’s name, we can confidently expect to win the race for life and share in the marvelous blessings Jehovah has in store for his servants in the immediate future and throughout eternity!—Compare 1 Corinthians 9:24-26.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The present auxiliary pioneer arrangement is now in its 11th year. Since it was introduced in September 1976, hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters have been enrolled. Many thousands of these arrange to serve as auxiliary pioneers during certain months each year. Others have been able to serve regularly as auxiliary pioneers for extended periods of time. All have had opportunity to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">benefit spiritua</span><span class="font13">lly, dr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">aw closer to J</span><span class="font13">ehov</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span><span class="font13">h, and become </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">more effectiv</span><span class="font13">e ministers of the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In September 1</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">976</span><span class="font13">, the first month of this arrangement, there was an enrollment of J£,38R; that was over 10,000 more than those reporting as temporary pioneers the previous month. Enthusiasm for auxiliary pioneering continued to grow to the extent that a peak of over </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">100,000</span><span class="font13"> was reached in </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">April 1985</span><span class="font13">. There were not quite so many in April 1986 because many former auxiliary pioneers had stepped into the regular pioneer ranks. Even so, over 96,000 were enrolled, the second highest number of auxiliary pioneers ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> For many, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">auxiliary pioneerin</span><span class="font13">g has proved to be a s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tepping-stone</span><span class="font13"> to privileges such as regu</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">lar pio</span><span class="font13">n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eering a</span><span class="font13">nd </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bethel servic</span><span class="font13">e.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY HAVE DONE IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Are you a parent w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ith children s</span><span class="font13">till at home? Do you have to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">work full-time</span><span class="font13"> secularly in order to support yourself and your family? Are you perhaps </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">elderly,</span><span class="font13"> or do you have physical limitations? Do not quickly conclude that although you would like to auxiliary pioneer, it is impossible for you to do so now. If you have a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">strong desire</span><span class="font13"> to pioneer for at least one or two months during the year, there may be a way open to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The requirement of </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">60 hours,</span><span class="font13"> may seem like a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">difficult challeng</span><span class="font13">e, but when you look at it from the standpoint of being an average of only </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">2 hour</span><span class="font13">s a day, leaving you with the rest of your time to care for other necessary obligations, the hour requirement may not seem so imposing. Can you spend some time in field service each day over a specified period of time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Please consider what some congregations have done to encourage auxiliary pioneer service and the happy results their efforts have produced. In one congr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">egation</span><span class="font13"> ne</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">arly half</span><span class="font13"> of the publishers enrolled as auxiliary pioneers.

Everyone in the congregation was_made aware that April was to be a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pioneer month</span><span class="font13">. A total of 28 enrolled. Over half were married couples. One couple had five children and another had six, yet with careful planning they were able to take proper care of their family responsibilities and meet the pioneer requirements. Seven of the group had full-time secular jobs where they worked from 40 to 50 hours a week. O</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pe brother, </span><span class="font13">who at first was apprehensive about signing up, stated: “</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">It really is a lot easier</span><span class="font13"> than I thought it was going to be. It just t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">akes a good schedule.</span><span class="font13">”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> An </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">elder in a southern stat</span><span class="font13">e wrote that 29 in his congregation auxiliary pioneered. When the names of those enrolled were announced, this encouraged others to join the ranks. Counting the 29 who enrolled, along with one regular pioneer, there were 10 brothers and 20 sisters. They ranged in age from 18 to 71.</span></p></li></ul>

How was she rewarded? Her husband gave his support, and as a result of her good example, he was inspired to start out in field service the following month. A</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nother sister </span><span class="font13">who had already signed up to auxiliary pioneer wrote to say that her employer hart gnno haak an his word about giving her time off. So she told him she would have to quit her job if she did not get the time off that she needed. She re</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">minded her employer </span><span class="font13">that sh</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e could call in sick</span><span class="font13"> as others might do, but she would never do that since it was not honest. He a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">greed to give her the time</span><span class="font13"> she needed. How did she benefit? Only a few days of auxiliary pioneering helped strengthen her reliance on Jehovah. She said /“I </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">don’t worry</span><span class="font13"> so much about fi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nances</span><span class="font13"> as I used to.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL YOU TRY IT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Are you one of th</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e many publishers</span><span class="font13"> who have had a lo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nging t</span><span class="font13">o he a pioneer but c</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">oncluded</span><span class="font13"> that personal </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">circumstances</span><span class="font13"> would </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">not permit pioneer</span><span class="font13">-ingJjn a regular basis? The Society had you in mind when introducing the auxiliary pioneer arrangement. Jehovah’s blessing and your careful planning are necessary, but you can be assured that the spiritual growth and the joy to be had will make it well worth while. (Neh. 8:10) Why not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">make pos</span><span class="font13">i</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tive plans, now</span><span class="font13"> to auxiliary pioneer in </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Marc</span><span class="font13">h and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">April?</span><span class="font13"> For some, May will be an ideal month for pioneering since it has five full weekends this year.

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> This is a time for vigorous increased activity on the part of all of God’s servants.

Can you also have a share?</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How do you respond to an invitation to participate in activity that brings enjoyment and refreshment? Likely it is with appreciation and eagerness. Jesus extended to his disciples a warm invitation to lasting happiness and refreshment. He said:(“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,... and you will find refreshment for your souls.”)That yoke of Christian discipleship includes inviting still others to have a share in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. The regular </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pioneer service is an excel</span><span class="font13">le</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">nt avenue for increasing yeur sh?<sup>r</sup>p</span><span class="font13"> in this work and in the happiness and refreshment it brings. —Matt. 11:28-30; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">• On Saturday, May 9,1987, the Brooklyn Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• The Memorial celebration will be held Sunday, April 12,1987. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown. </span><span class="font12">Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no other meetings are to be conducted on that date, appropriate adjustments should be made according to local circumstances. If more than two congregations are using the same Kingdom Hall in areas where daylight saving time will be in effect, it may be necessary to arrange for alternate meeting places in order to avoid having some congregations hold their Memorial celebration very late at night. Circuit overseers will also adjust their schedule that week so that only the Memorial celebration will be scheduled for April 12.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus instructed his followers to preach the good news and to “make disciples.” (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Conducting home Bible studies is a very </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">effective means</span><span class="font13"> of making disciples. Since this important work is </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">part of our worshi</span><span class="font13">p, we should strive to do our very </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">best</span><span class="font13"> when preparing for and conducting home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARING FOR THE STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Preparing to conduct a home Bible study involves more than just reading the lesson and looking up cited scriptures. To reach the heart of our Bible student, we need to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">presen</span><span class="font13">t the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">material in a way that will motivate</span><span class="font13"> him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> First, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">we must have a clear under</span><span class="font13">s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tandin</span><span class="font13">g of the material ourselves. We need to know how all the s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">crip</span><span class="font13">t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ures apply</span><span class="font13"> to the paragraphs and to the Bible student. Underlining key words and phrases helps us to remember. We need to isolate the main </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ideas</span><span class="font13"> of the lesson and think about </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">how to convey</span><span class="font13"> them to the student. Additionally, the student’s level of Scriptural knowledge, areas in which he has had problems accepting certain matters, where he needs to improve his Christian personality, and so forth, must be considered. We can ask: ‘How might the material and the scriptures in the lesson HFnspd tn </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">help Him make advancement?</span><span class="font13">’ At times additional research may be necessary. There is a need to prepare carefully if the student truly is to benefit.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Making Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Experienced ministers have observed that meaningful return visits progressively stimulate and enhance growth toward becoming a believer. This feature of our ministry cannot be taken for granted. Preparation is the key to being effective. What are some practical suggestions to keep in mind? How can all of us, whether new or seasoned publishers, share in this Kingdom service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Preparation for a return visit begins on the initial call. How so? Complete and accurate records must be kept of all interest shown. Take time to make a note of the name of the householder, the subject discussed, his response, and any placements made. It helps to be specific. So, before making each return visit, review your house-to-house record and give prayerful thought to what you will say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> For most of us, making return visits presents a challenge. However, this feature of the service need not be complicated. When return visits are purposeful, you will more effectively water the seeds of truth. (1 Cor. 3:6) When following up a magazine placement, you could point out that “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom” is the stated purpose of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> Ask the householder if he knows who Jehovah is, and after getting his response, take a moment to read a scripture such as Psalm 83:18. The call could be terminated after laying the groundwork for another visit, or if time permits, use the first guestion on page 149 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book on the subject “God” to continue the discussion. Or you could use the information under the subject “Jehovah” on pages 196-7. To pave the way for your next call, mention that many people have been taught to pray the Lord’s Prayer, in which we ask for God’s Kingdom to come and his will to be done. Let the householder know that when you return you would like to direct his attention to some Bible texts that clearly explain what God’s Kingdom is and what the earth will be like when God’s will is done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> To follow up a literature placement, show the householder a point he may enjoy. Try to build on the subject previously discussed. If you are following up the current Topic for Conversation, you might say: “When I last spoke with you, we discussed the Bible’s sure promise of peace. There is only one government that can bring earthwide peace—God’s Kingdom. Notice what the Bible itself says at Isaiah 9:6, 7. [Read.] Would you not enjoy life under such genuinely peaceful conditions? [Allow for response.] However, besides true peace, the Bible lists many specific blessings that God’s Kingdom will bring for mankind.” At this point you may be able to direct attention to a particular paragraph. For several visits thereafter, you could use the points under “Kingdom” on pages 225-34 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font13">book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Sharing in the return visit work helps us to ‘glorify our ministry.’ (Rom. 11:13) Why not set a personal goal of making at least one return visit each week? Follow the practical suggestions presented herein and seek the aid of those who are experienced in this aspect of the field service. By teaching others through well-prepared return visits, your ministry will be more meaningful, your joy will increase, and your faith will grow.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">house-to-house work each week? Is it your goal to become a more capable teacher on return visits and home Bible studies? Some in school have set a yearly goal of being an auxiliary pioneer during one or more vacation months.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> What about goals for the near future? What do you want to accomplish in the next year or so and thereafter? Is it your goal to become a regular pioneer minister, a member of the Bethel family, or perhaps a missionary?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> If you are a young brother, are you reaching out for the privilege of serving as a ministerial servant and someday becoming an elder? By setting definite goals and diligently working toward them, you can direct your life in a more useful way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Remember that some congregation elders, circuit and district overseers, missionaries, and persons in Bethel service were at one time young people in the truth. But they reached out and grew in knowledge and in ability to serve God and their brothers. Their example of zeal and accomplishment should encourage you to make good use of the time you have during your youth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Goals must be practical and set </span><span class="font12">8 </span><span class="font13">according to what you are able to accomplish. Everyone is different in makeup physically, mentally, and emotionally. There are also various stages of spiritual growth. Therefore, do not expect to accomplish something just because someone else does.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> You can be sure that you make Jehovah happy when you reach out for spiritual goals. As you work toward and attain these goals, do so with a determination to give your best. It is worth all your effort and will result in rich blessings for you now and in the years to come.—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li></ul>

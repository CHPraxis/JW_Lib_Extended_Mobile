<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:26—Why Jesus made known God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 83:18—What God’s name is.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintaining Joy in Our Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What incomparable joy is to be found in serving Jehovah God! It is just as he said long ago through the prophet Isaiah: “Look! My own servants will rejoice . . . Look! My own servants will cry out joyfully.” (Isa. 65:13, 14) Why do Jehovah’s people rejoice and cry out joyfully today? Because of their spiritual prosperity as they dwell in a spiritual paradise. This joy moves them to share in the all-important work of helping others come to know Jehovah and share in his goodness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Learning about present-day increases as set forth in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font13">brings us much joy. The same was true of Jesus’ disciples in the first century. News of Jehovah’s blessings upon the preaching work was a source of encouragement. (Acts 15: 3, 4) As the ingathering speeds up today, we are encouraged to keep busy in the ministry. Why is the month of May a very favorable time to do that? The weather is usually mild and this year May has five weekends, so many will find it an ideal time to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BE CONVINCED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Heartfelt conviction motivates us to speak to others about our hope. (Luke 6:45) It helps us even in territory that may seem unproductive. We need to persevere, relying fully on Jehovah just as David did, who said: “O Jehovah, may you open</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Responding to Jehovah’s Love During Youth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do you young ones in the congregation see the abundant evidence of Jehovah’s great love that surrounds you? Are you responding to that love in a way that is pleasing to him? How can you do that?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Most of you have loving parents who at great sacrifice to themselves have provided for you materially, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally so as to assure your getting a good start in life. Truly, this is a rich blessing from Jehovah. Additionally, through his organization, he has made available a numb</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">er of publica</span><span class="font13"></span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tions</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">magazine articles d</span><span class="font13">esigned especially for you, to help you get on in life and be able </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">to cope</span><span class="font13"> with everyday cares. If you have taken advantage of these provisions, you are also well equipped tn face Hifflciilt situat</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ions that c</span><span class="font13">onfound today’s youth. Do you view all of this as evidence of God’s love for you?—1 John 4:8,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah has made the Bible available to all of us, whether old or young in years. And the ransom benefit he has provided through his Son Jesus these lips of mine.”—Ps. 51:15; 63:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Such conviction is the product of strong faith, genuine hope, and Christian love. (1 Cor. 13:13) These qualities are cultivated through diligent personal study, application of what we learn, and perseverance in prayer. (Rom. 12:12) With Jehovah’s loving help, a positive attitude toward our service can be developed and maintained. In this way our joy in the ministry is sustained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> May is the second month of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> subscription offer. Each issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> contains lifesaving information. We benefit from the spiritual food it contains and so will others if they receive and read this magazine regularly. By having a subscription, each issue will be available in their home. With our neighbors’ welfare in mind, we want to take advantage of every opportunity to offer the subscription. If the householder is busy, a brief presentation of the subscription offer may be made. If refused, offer the current magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We know that doing Jehovah’s work brings eternal joy not only to us but also to those who listen and act on what they hear. (Phil. 4:4) As the good news of the Kingdom reaches the hearts of many other righteously inclined individuals, may we continue to rejoice in Jehovah, and may Jehovah’s blessing be on our efforts in the ministry.—Ps. 32:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Christ applies to young ones who exercise faith just as it does to faithful older ones. The Kingdom hope is yours, along with its promise of a paradise earth, where you can be free from troublesome anxieties that overwhelm so many of today’s young people who have not come to know Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Does it not warm y</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">our hear</span><span class="font13">t toward Jehovah just to know that he has d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">one so much</span><span class="font13"> for you even without your asking? (Rom. 5:8) But beyond just holding an inward feeling of gratitude, how </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">can you respond</span><span class="font13"> to Jehovah’s loveln a practical way?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOW HOW YOU FEEL BY ACTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> You can do things to make the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">truth your own.</span><span class="font13"> For example, you can make it your goal to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">read the entire </span><span class="font13">Riblgj</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">n a year.</span><span class="font13"> You can do this by determinedly reading f</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">our or five pages a dav</span><span class="font13">- Learn how to use the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font13"> to find answers to your questions.

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1987 &quot;Trust in Jehovah&quot; District Convention</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> How superbly the 1987 convention theme describes the feelings of Jehovah’s Witnesses! “Trust in Jehovah” is more than just a theme to us; it reflects our deepest convictions. Many people in the world trust in human wisdom and accomplishments; foolishly they put confidence in themselves and their ability to survive. (Ps. 49:6, 7,10; Prov. 18:11) In contrast, yve trust </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">in Jehovah</span><span class="font14">, the Supreme One of the universe, to fulfill his promises toward obedient mankind. We are convinced that he will provide for all our needs and protect us fromTasting~harm when Satan’s system comes to its end. Would you not agree that “Trust in Jehovah” is a most fitting theme for our 1987 district convention series? We can show that we appreciate this spiritual provision in our behalf by being in attendance for the entire three-day convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> By now your plans should be nearly complete as to transportation and accommodations. As announced in the February 1, 1987, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font14">there are </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">123 conventions schedule</span><span class="font14">d for the United States. Since the convention for 1987 will be for three days instead of four as in previous years, each day will have a full schedule. The program will include </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">talks</span><span class="font14">, dem</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">onstratio</span><span class="font14">ns, and dramas. There will be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">no arrangement for field service </span><span class="font14">during the convention this year. «</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">’With the convention being thg</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eefull davs</span><span class="font14">, it will likely be easier for all to attend. Have you approached your employer, if it is necessary, to request time .off so that you can be in attendance all three days? The entire program, from the opening music on </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Friday at </span><span class="font14">1</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">0:20 a.m</span><span class="font14">- to the closing prayer Sunday at approximately </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">4:00 p</span><span class="font14">.m., will be filled with a wealth of practical, faithstrengthening spiritual instruction and encouragement that we cannot afford to miss.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Those planning to be baptized at one of the district conventions should be sure to.inform_the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">presiding overseer</span><span class="font14"> well before the convention so that there will be ample time to review the questions in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font14"> book.

This is important today when fashion designers seem to want to flaunt sexuality and achieve almost total nudity. Another factor to take into account is that some suits that appear modest when dry are less than that when wet. No one getting baptized would want to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">be a cause for </span><span class="font14">distraction or </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">stumblin</span><span class="font14">g at an event as serious as baptisni?y(Phil. 1:10) This would apply to b</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">rother</span><span class="font14">s as well as sisters.</span></p></li>

After the baptism talk you will be asked to stand during the singing of the closing song.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">’TAUGHT BY JEHOVAH: </span><span class="font14">It was prophesied: “And all your sons will be perso</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ns </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">taugh</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font14"> by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.” (Isa. 54:13) Those words were addressed to Jehovah’s symbolic wife, his heavenly organization. Her “sons” are taught to trust in Jehovah. The district convention </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">is one of the means that Je</span><span class="font14">hovah u</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ses to teac</span><span class="font14">h us today. Dqlyou vie</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">w it as suc</span><span class="font14">h? You may quickly respond, ‘Of co</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">urse I</span><span class="font14"> do.’ But while at the convention, are you doing everything possible to absorb thp_pntirp program <sup>9</sup> It is evident that with </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">some thi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:line-through underline;">s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:line-through;"> has not ™h&quot;eyf-hppn the cas</span><span class="font14">e What can we do, individually and as a family, to ensure that we gain the maximum benefit from the convention program?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> C.opsiderahle effort and expense may be required on our part to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">attend</span><span class="font14"> the convention. In addition, the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Society and the brother</span><span class="font14">s in the host cities have l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">abored many hours to provide u</span><span class="font14">s with the best facilities possible. Add to this the thousands of hours spent by the Society and the speakers in preparing for the program, and it is apparent that we have much for which to be thankful. Will your appreciation move you to get the maximum benefit from the entire convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> It is important to get sufficient restearh night. We want to arrive at the convention alert and eager to enjoy every minute of the program. If you arriv</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e tired</span><span class="font14">, you will no</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">t find it easy to keen awak</span><span class="font14">e and attentive, and your ability to benefit fully from the program will be greatly reduced. So, coming to the convention well rested each day can contribute much to our enjoying the spiritual feast.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> We will be helped to concentrate if we remind ourselves of why we are going to the convention —to “listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) As recorded in Isaiah 55:1, Jehovah invited his covenant people to partake of life-giving provisions that he offered without cost. But to take advantage of such, they would need to “listen </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">ntentl</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">y.”</span><span class="font14"> He added this exhortatioij: “Inclineyour ear and come to me. Listen, and your soul will keep alive.’J(Isa. 55:2, 3) Similarly, would we be able to accept Jehovah’s generous offer of life-sustaining spiritual nourishment in the modern-day spiritual paradise if we were too sleepy to absorb what the speakers were saying? Obviously, we want </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">to show </span><span class="font14">our appreciation by doing all we can to be mentally and physically prepared so as not to miss any of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> One pleasurable aspect of district conventions that we treasure is the ass</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ociatio</span><span class="font14">n with our brothers. We look forward to renewin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">g old friendships</span><span class="font14">, making new </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">acquaintances</span><span class="font14">, and sharing experiences with one another. Some customarily arrange to visit with family and friends after the conclusion of the day’s session. These reunions can be very enjoyable and spiritually stimulating. But please be sure that such visiting does not continue cn lato into the evening hours that you are unable to get the needed rest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> It is suggested that some thought be given to the items we bring with us to the convention site. Some brothers have brought l</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">arge cooler</span><span class="font14">s and other </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">bulky items</span><span class="font14"> that could not be placed under their seat. These have been placed in </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">aisleway</span><span class="font14">s or on empty chairs. We need to show consideration in such matters since this has result</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed in some being </span><span class="font14">deprived </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">of a sea</span><span class="font14">t and at times is done in violation of the fire </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">code</span><span class="font14">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> NOTE-TAKING: </span><span class="font14">Besides your Bible and songbook, remember to bring „a. notepad and pen or pencil. We may not be in the habit of taking notes during weekly congregation meetings because most of the talks and demonstrations are taken from material thatw qvailable to all in the congregation. Taking in information at the district convention is an entirely different matter. While some of the talks will in time appear in the publications, others will not. Even if aLLthe </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">talks would eventu</span><span class="font14">ally appe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ar in print,</span><span class="font14"> there are still significant </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ben</span><span class="font14">efits if vo</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">u take brief,</span><span class="font14"> meaningful notes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> Taking notes serves as an aid to c</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">oncentra</span><span class="font14">tion. With your pen and pad in hand, isolate tlie speaker’s </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">key points</span><span class="font14"> and key scriptures or </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">a new </span><span class="font14">thought that may be presented. Then make brief notes of these. Usually a sentence or two will suffice for a key point. By following this suggestion, your concen</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">tration will unquestionably im</span><span class="font14">prove. You will be less likely to let your mind drift or be distracted by some activity in the convention area. You will also be equipped to participate in the r</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">eview of the convention highlight</span><span class="font14">s with your congregation the following week. ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>16</sup> Will you have young children or teenagers with you? Then why not arrange for them also to ta</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ke notes</span><span class="font14"> in accord with their ability and age? Let the family know that you plan to review some of the main points brought out by the speakers when you return to your place of lodging or while you are traveling home. Younger children can be encouraged to write d</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">own all the scripture citation</span><span class="font14">s that are read or notghowmany times </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">they hear a </span><span class="font14">speaker refer to key </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">wor</span><span class="font14">d</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">s or the theme of his talk</span><span class="font14">. By doing this, they will get much more from the talks. It is good for children to learn to pay close attention at Christian meetings. You will be helping them to build a solid foundation for the future. —ITim. 6:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> CONDUCT ABOVE REPROACH: </span><span class="font14">Each year at the conclusion of our district conventions, we generally receive favorable comments about the orderliness and good conduct that was in evidence. Observers often remark about the neat appearance of adults and children alike, not to mention the peace and unity of the brothers while attending the convention. The year 1986 was no exception. But why do we mention this? Because it is encouraging to know that when we set a fine example, it is observed and appreciated by others. (1 Cor. 4:9) More importantly, though, it brings praise to God. We want to honor Jehovah in word and deed, and since people may judge the organization and even the God we worship by our conduct, we want to be ever conscious of how we act.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>18</sup> The manager of one motel wrote: “All of your delegates were very cordial and polite, and we all enjoyed having them with us.” A government official living near a stadium being used by Jehovah’s Witnesses for their convention said: “As a neighbor I can say I believe in your association, in the way in which you clean the stadium.... I believe in your discipline.” A police officer said: “You people are really at unity and happy. There is no problem of peace and order when you are here. All are quiet and disciplined. Your par-king is orderly and it is easy to talk to you if there is a problem.” A bank manager observed: “Everybody behaved properly. When you are with them [Jehovah’s Witnesses] there is nothing to worry about. They are really divine peace makers. This kind of attitude is absent in other groups of people.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>19</sup> There are a number of areas, however, to which we still need to give attention for us fully to ‘shine as illuminators,’ especially when we are away from the convention grounds, such as at restaurants and motels. (Phil. 2:15) But, first, how are we doing in the matter of unnecessary seat saving?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>20</sup> Improvement has been noted in this regard, and for this we commend you. However, please keep in mind that SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR. It is only natural to want to sit near the ones we came with, and it is expected that immediate family members would sit together. But please do not reserve seats for others. Oftentimes friends locate seats on their own, and the extra ones you saved are not used. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Trust i</span><span class="font14">n </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jehova</span><span class="font14">h, and appreciation for the convention will be evident by our following these directions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>21</sup> We should conduct ourselves in an exemplary manner AT ALL TIMES. A number of letters have been received reporting that some brothers left the convention grounds before the program was concluded and rushed to their motel so they could be first in the swimming pool. Unsupervised children and teenagers were among them. Some Witness children remained in the pool for hours, keeping other guests from using the facilities. It was also noticed that some who attended the convention, on returning to their motels, were caught up in the spirit that is so typical of this pleasure-seeking world. This was even reflected in their changing into immodest and faddish attire. In some cases it became difficult to identify them as fellow Witnesses. This emphasizes the need to maintain conduct and grooming that is above reproach at all times. —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>22</sup> After the convention program has concluded, many enjoy getting together for a meal and association. If the time is used wisely, this can prove to be spiritually stimulating as we share experiences and review the convention highlights. Doing this will give no cause for complaint, since we behave “in a manner worthy of the good news.”—Phil. 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>23</sup> A final kindly reminder has to do with visiting and talking during the sessions. If the program has begun and you are in your seat but then notice a brother whom you have not seen for a long time passing by, what will you do? Will you stand up, wave, and call out to the brother, or will you quietly remain seated and try to locate him later? What would you think of a brother or a sister who would call out to someone entering the Kingdom Hall after the meeting has started or who would visit in the back of the hall during a meeting? If you have to leave your seat to use the rest room or to take your children there, the loving thing would be to return to your seat as quickly as possible without visiting in the corridors. We have been reminded that being at a convention should really be no different from being at our local Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font14">As already announced in the January 1987 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> insert, a few adjustments have been made in the food service arrangement. This will enable more of our brothers and sisters who previously worked in food preparation to benefit from the spiritual food presented. However, the willing service of those who are needed as volunteers is very much appreciated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>28</sup> All attending the convention will find the food available to be satisfactory and nourishing, giving good variety for three days. Great care has been taken to buy food of the highest quality. Your giving full support to the food service arrangement will help to defray some of the expenses of the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font14">The emphasis on simplification is particularly noted in connection with the man-hours needed to organize and operate a district convention. Those who have been in the truth many years recall that before and during large conventions, tens of thousands of volunteers were needed, devoting many hours of their time in various convention departments. That labor of love was deeply appreciated, but it often resulted in many of the volunteers missing a great deal of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>27</sup> While fewer volunteers and fewer hours are now required to do the work, volunteer help is still needed for the smooth operation of a district convention. Can you have a share? No one should feel that volunteering will mean missing most of the program as some have experienced in the past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>28</sup> When you arrive at the convention site, check with the Volunteer Service Department. Even if you may be able to work for only part of the convention, your services will be appreciated. Children under 16 years of age are required to work with a parent or a guardian.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> CONCLUSION: </span><span class="font14">Convention time is near. We hope to see all of you there. The Bethel family eagerly anticipates being with you at the various conventions throughout the United States. Jehovah has organized his name people theocratically, and he knows what we need in these final days. Just as Jehovah gathered his people in ancient Israel for spiritual instruction, so he does with his faithful Witnesses today. By this means, Jehovah strengthens and fortifies us to endure faithfully to the end. Then we will be blessed with life in his new system. (Isa. 40:29; 41:10; 1 John 5:14) Of this we are assured as long as we continue to “trust in Jehovah.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font13">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already confirmed a reservation, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you have made duplicate reservations with the idea of selecting preferred rooms upon arrival, please cancel the duplicates immediately. Making duplicate reservations and failing to cancel reservations that will not be used damages our reputation and relationship with motel managers who are giving us special rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or the motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer or camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font13">In many states, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. However, car or infant seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font13">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be 10:20 a.m. on Friday and at 9:30 a.m. on the other days at most conventions. Make plans to stay until the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 5:35 p.m. on Friday, 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, and 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS: A </span><span class="font13">meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter Bethel service. Announcements will be made at the convention city regarding the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font13">All </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font13"> pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any gift releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only, upon showing their Watchtower ID card. Those in Bethel service may obtain these same provisions by showing their Bethel ID card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font13">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention and to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font13"> the specially designed lapel card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a means of identification but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> be available at the conventions. The lapel cards are two cents each. (Lapel cards have already been consigned to each congregation by the Society, but the plastic holders must be ordered by the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font13">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font13"> times and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font13"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Additionally, it has been reported that there is a greater risk of falls on stairs and ramps when sisters wear high-heeled shoes. Please be careful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As discussed in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> for December 1986, there continues to be an urgent need for more Kingdom Halls. The brothers are making regular contributions in support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, and this is indeed gratifying. It is in harmony with the Christian spirit of always being “ready to share.” Generous giving by the brothers shows that we are resting our hope on God, who “furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment.” —1 Tim. 6:17, 18.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Have you had the joy of studying with someone to the point where he took his stand on Jehovah's side? It is a precious moment when someone symbolizes his dedication by water baptism. Each year tens of thousands take this step, but just as children need guidance as they grow, new ones also need assistance in making spiritual advancement. —1 Cor. 4:14-17; 2 Cor. 6:13.</span></p></li>

Do they need help to prepare for and participate in in Kingdom Hall construction, other publishers have increased their support of local field service activity. It is encouraging to note the wholehearted cooperation of so many. Since all of us “have gifts differing according to the undeserved kindness given to us,” let us continue making full use of these.—Rom. 12: 4, 6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">[ PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus gave all of us a goal in our ministry when he commanded us to “make disciples ..., teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) The most effective way to accomplish this is through the home Bible study arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Starting new Bible studies requires diligence on our part as fellow workers with God. (1 Cor. 3:9) Starting a study also depends a great deal on the heart condition of the individual. Jehovah’s spirit operates to draw honesthearted ones and gives us direction in helping them to grow spiritually. This is borne out by the experience of the Ethiopian eunuch. (Acts 8:26-31) He was reading the prophecy of Isaiah but could not understand it, despite his being a Jewish proselyte and an educated man. However, he had a proper heart condition. Jehovah’s spirit operated upon Philip to give the eunuch a clear understanding of the prophecy, moving him to request baptism.—Acts 8:32-36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah continues to use his servants today as instruments in helping honesthearted people to become disciples. How much Jehovah uses us is determined largely by our diligence, effectiveness, and willingness to be used as teachers. Success in starting Bible studies does not come automatically. It requires careful preparation coupled with a sincere desire to impart the truth to others. (Ezek. 9:4; Rom. 10:13, 14) To overcome objections, we should apply suggestions such as those offered in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> and in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. If you need personal assistance in starting a Bible study, ask those who are experienced to help you. Arrange ,t£l w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">grk with the circuit overseer </span><span class="font13">when he serves the congregation. The elders, ministerial servants, or regular pioneers may be able to work with you in the return visit work and help you start a Bible study. In this way you will learn how to get the best results from your ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BE WHOLEHEARTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Starting home Bible studies requires wholehearted exertion. (Col. 3:23, 24) That means working hard in the house-to-house ministry with the definite goal of finding individuals who want to study the Bible. We must be diligent in making return visits. We often call when people are not at home. Why not vary the times we call, returning when the people are most likely to be at home and more receptive to the Kingdom message? Some have</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Return visits should be well planned, having the specific householder in mind. In some areas a simplified, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">direct approach i</span><span class="font13">s best. The latest brochures and tracts are designed to come right to the point on a particular subject. By acquainting ourselves with them, we may get better results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Remember that even though we are well prepared and give an enthusiastic witness, a new disciple is made only with the help of Jehovah’s spirit. (1 Cor. 3:6) We should persevere in prayer, asking Jehovah to direct us and to open the hearts of those to whom we preach. (1 John 3:22) Jehovah will see to it that sheeplike ones, like the Ethiopian eunuch, receive an opportunity to accept the Kingdom message. By working in harmony with our prayers in behalf of sheeplike ones, we can become more effective in starting home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>

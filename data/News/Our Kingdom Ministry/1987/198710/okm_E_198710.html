<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Study the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:16, 17—It is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:3—Provides knowledge that leads to everlasting life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“As for Me and My Household ... ”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “As tor me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.&quot; (Josh. 24: 14, 15) Such determination, on the part of Joshua and other family heads was absolutely necessary if Israelite families were t</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">o resist the pressure</span><span class="font11">s against true worship in the land of Canaan. Similarly today, we must be </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">resolut</span><span class="font11">e in our stand for true worship in order to </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">fortify ourselve</span><span class="font11">s and our families to withstand the unwholesome influences of the system of things that surrounds us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> It is the God-given responsibility of family hearic to provide for their households. (1 Tim. 5:8) This is true not only regarding material things but much </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">more so in a spiritual wa</span><span class="font11">v! Family heads, do you nave a good pro</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">gram of fam</span><span class="font11">ily worship, including practical Bible instruction, and do you </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">take the lead w</span><span class="font11">ith your family in the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">field ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY BIBLE DISCUSSIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Since Jehovah’s acts of loving-kindness are “new each morning,” would it not be proper for the entire family to </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">give thought to th</span><span class="font11">ese each day? (Lam. 3:22, 23) An excellent way to do this is by discussing the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">day’s</span><span class="font11"> text from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily.—</span><span class="font11">See suggestions in the foreword of 1987 edition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In addition to the daily text discussion, many theocratic households have a </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">regular time for family stu</span><span class="font11">dy and worship. (Deut. 4:9; 6:1,2) To help in this, the Society’s publica</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Dedication and Baptism</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a joy it is to see the increasing number of people who are studying the Bible and associating with Jehovah’s organization! And there is an even greater joy in helping them to develop and maintain a close spiritual relationship with Jehovah God himself.—Compare Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Commendably, many new ones have progressed to the point of becoming approved associates, and most of them are sharing regularly in the preaching work. Now they should be working toward dedication and baptism. How can we aid them in taking these important steps?—Matt. 28:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW WE CAN HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We need to help Bible students cultivate love and appreciation for Jehovah so that they will be moved by faith to dedicate themselves to him. (1 Chron. 28:9a) Accordingly, during the home Bible study, teach them to discern Jehovah’s qualities as you discuss his deeds and standards. Also, help the students appreciate tions have provided encouragement and </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">sugg</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">stions</span><span class="font11"> that each family head would do well to follow.—See </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">w86 11/1 p. 24:</span><span class="font11">. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font11">pp. 36-8; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font11"> 2/</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">79 pp. 1,</span><span class="font11"> 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Since the fi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">eld ministry is a ma</span><span class="font11">jor aspect of our w</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">orship</span><span class="font11">, the family should </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">share</span><span class="font11"> in this t</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ogether</span><span class="font11">. (Heb. 13:15) Family </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">heads</span><span class="font11"> can do much to promote family unity and build spiritual strength by w</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">orking</span><span class="font11"> in field service with.each </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">member</span><span class="font11"> of the household. (Prov. 22:6) October presents a fine opportunity to do this, since we will be offering one-year subscriptions for either </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> or both, for $5.00 each.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> At times, pa</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">rents may wis</span><span class="font11">h to make the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">introduction a</span><span class="font11">t. the door ancT then a</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">llow the child to read</span><span class="font11"> a sc</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ripture</span><span class="font11"> or simply to show the magazines and offer a subscription. If the subscription is ref</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">used</span><span class="font11">, single issues can be o</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffered for 25&lt;t e</span><span class="font11">ach. </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Do no</span><span class="font11">t underestimate wTmt_c.hifd£en can do in the ministry! Often householders are impressed by young ones who can express themselves well at the doors. —Matt. 21:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Are you, like Joshua, d</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">etermine</span><span class="font11">d that you and your household will serve Jehovah faithfully? Pray for</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Highlight Jehovah’s loving purpose for man and the earth, as well as the sanctification of His holy name. Help the student to see clearly how he is involved and how he can provide an answer to the one taunting Jehovah. (Prov. 27:11) Take every opportunity to help the student in his spiritual growth so that he will “disown himself and pick up his torture stake,&quot; getting baptized as a disciple of Jesus Christ.—Matt. 16:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Help your Bible students see that Jehovah’s laws and principles are for our good. They must realize that if they wait until the last minute to take a stand for true worship, they could lose out on the prize of life. (Luke 21: 34, 35) Speak to them of your appreciation for his organization, the congregation, the meetings, and the brotherhood. (Ps. 100:2) Show them that God’s Word is alive and exerts </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During 1988 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TEXTBOOKS: The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bil2], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial&quot;</span><span class="font10"> [si], </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font10"> [rs], and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font10"> [pe] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The school will begin with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or by a qualified ministerial servant. It will be based on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.&quot; </span><span class="font10">This assignment should be delivered as a ten-minute instruction talk with a five-minute oral review following, using the printed questions for this section. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">practical value of</span><span class="font10"> the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. Where needed, a theme should be selected. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or another qualified elder or by a ministerial servant assigned by the school overseer. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font10"> overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font10"> the information is of value to us. Check </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> issues for further highlight material. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font10"> the assigned verses should actually be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to sisters. The subjects for this talk will alternate between the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> books, the latter to be mainly assigned to young or new students. The student assigned should be able to read. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. It is preferred that settings involve field service or informal witnessing. The one giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned to a brother or a sister. When assigned to a brother, this should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the brother to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable audience-type setting, the brother may choose to develop his talk accordingly. The student should use the theme shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">S-38 10/87</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student speaker merits solely a “G&quot; and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G,&quot; “I,” or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student’s next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those giving talks should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows after the giving of necessary oral counsel, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than a total of two minutes for counsel and remarks after each student talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">PREPARING TALKS: Brothers giving Assignment No. 1 should select a theme where needed. Students assigned the second talk should choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material. Students assigned the third and fourth talks should use the theme shown. Prior to giving the talk, students will want to read over the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font10"> material dealing with the speech quality being worked on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Talks No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The brother assigned to give the “stop signal&quot; should do so promptly. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. The school overseer will already have made sure that he covers main points that should be highlighted and that were overlooked by the speakers. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper. The school overseer will read off all answers and concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 50 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Of course, nondedicated persons who are leading lives that conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ABSENTEES: All in the congregation can show appreciation for this school by endeavoring to be present at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font10"> is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously.</span><span class="font10"> If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Without doubt, Jehovah God has ‘equipped us with every good thing to do his will.’ Accordingly, as we effectively use the things he provides, Jehovah ‘performs in us through Jesus Christ that which is well-pleasing in his sight.’—Heb. 13: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The modern history of his people clearly shows that Jehovah God has provided direction and has equipped us with the publications we need in order to accomplish the work he has given us to do. (Matt. 24:14; 28: 19, 20; Rev. 9:17, 19) Jehovah has blessed the effective use of these provisions, and the Christian congregation continues to experience outstanding growth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW RELEASES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Recently, at our “Trust in Jehovah” District Conventions, we were thrilled to receive new publications to help others establish their trust in God. At the close of his address Friday morning, the chairman released a new tract, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible.</span><span class="font11"> Then, in the afternoon appropriate demonstrations showed us how to use it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Have you been using this tract? It goes well with our current Topic for Conversation. Some who need to use a simple presentation will And this tract very helpful. Most of us will be able to use it effectively in our ministry in a variety of ways—perhaps to introduce our presentation, | to offer when a householder is busy, and to leave when we find no one at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It was a pleasure to know that three more tracts are now available. They are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s</span><span class="font11"> Witnesses </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Believe?, Life in a Peaceful New World,</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font11"> These tracts will also</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">following the same procedure as for regular subscriptions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> For the benefit of the blind and </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">those physically unable</span><span class="font11"> to use or read conventionally printed matter, the Society is making </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> on cassette available a</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">t a re</span><span class="font11">d</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">uced rate</span><span class="font11"> that is less than production cost. Those qualified for this reduced rate will receive their cassettes p</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ostage free</span><span class="font11"> as “Free Matter for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.” In order to qualify, it will be necessary tn prnvirTn~cprti»-</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">cation of impairment</span><span class="font11"> with each reduced-rate subscription. This may be in the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">form of a certificate</span><span class="font11">, such help others learn what the Bible teaches and why they can trust God’s promises. Be sure to carry some of them with you for use in both regular and informal witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A most treasured new release at the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention is the pocket edition of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font11"> Over the years, we have used different Bibles in the field ministry, but now we have one that can be carried in pocket or purse. Here is another evidence that Jehovah God has ‘equipped us with every good thing to do his will.’ So whether we are engaging in the regular features of service or witnessing informally, we can have a copy of God’s Word handy to support what we express. How happy we are to have this new pocket edition of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUT THEM TO GOOD USE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> These new convention releases brought forth spontaneous applause when they were announced. Immediately we could see the good to be accomplished in the preaching and teaching work with the aid of these timely provisions from Jehovah, ‘the Giver of every good and perfect gift.’ (Jas. 1:17) To the extent that we use these publications, we can expect our joy to increase because of the fine Kingdom fruitage that will result.—John 15:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Taking a lesson from Jesus’ parable of the talents, we know that Jehovah expects us to put to good use all that he has given us. Therefore, let us fully accomplish our ministry with the use of his provisions, including these new releases. As a result, we will receive our Lord’s approval and blessing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Special-Interest Articles in Our Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus foretold that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations,” none of his disciples could have foreseen the scope of the work as we now see it being accomplished. (Matt. 24:14) There were no printing presses in those days, nor could anyone have conceived of MEPS (Multilanguage Electronic Phototypesetting System), which is currently capable of setting type in 186 different languages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Watch Tower publications are making the good news available to interested people everywhere. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is published in 103 languages with an average printing of 12,315,000, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> is now in 54 languages with an average printing of 10,610,000. It is our privilege to use these magazines in presenting this good news to “all sorts of men.” —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEATURE SPECIAL-INTEREST ARTICLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When you get a new issue of the magazines, do you enjoy reading it through in order to find out how Jehovah is benefiting us by the material prepared? (Isa. 48:17) After that, why not decide which article you would like to present in the field and thus be ready for service? Perhaps you will note something that would be of particular interest to certain</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">power. Use it to move the students to associate with God’s people at meetings, assemblies, conventions, and otherwise. This will help them develop a desire to have a close personal relationship with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DO NOT DELAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The Ethiopian eunuch to whom Philip spoke did not delay in getting baptized. He searched his own mind and heart and asked Philip if there were any factors that prevented him from getting baptized. Finding no cause for delay, he promptly got baptized. (Acts 8:26-38) That is the spirit we want to cultivate in Bible students today.—Compare John 14:23; 2 Corinthians 5:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Only those ‘marked’ for salvation will survive into Jehovah's new system. (Ezek. 9:2-6) How happy those who submit to this ‘marking’ for survival will be because of their dedicated relationship with Jehovah God, as symbolized by water baptism! people in your territory. A judge in Ohio wrote a letter of appreciation to a Witness couple who brought him an issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> dealing with the problem of drinking and driving.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In addition to presenting the magazines from house to house, do you show articles you find particularly interesting to people where you work? Do you visit business places to offer the magazines at times when the proprietors are not rushed? Do you share the truth with others on the streets as you have occasion? Many brothers and sisters, including those who find it difficult to climb stairs in city territory, do this work very effectively, approaching people who cannot be reached otherwise. In this way they give a modern application to Proverbs 1:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A GOOD EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman who had come to a well for water, he said: “If you had known ... who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” (John 4:7-10) Just as that woman did not know Jesus or the life-giving truth he had, so the people today may not know who we are or the importance of the message we bring them. Jesus spoke with the people on every appropriate occasion and everywhere—a good example for us to follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> As we enjoy the fine spiritual food in the well-illustrated magazines now reaching us, may we do what we can to share it with others! They too may respond as did the Samaritan woman who said to Jesus: “Sir, give me this water.” Indeed, those now receiving with appreciation this fine spiritual food may finally be guided to the “fountains of waters of life.” —John 4:11-15; Rev. 7:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What a wonderful provision the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index </span><span class="font11">1930-1985 is for research and study! However, many brothers do not have in their personal or Kingdom Hall library all the publications referred to in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span><span class="font11"> In order to help provide some of this material, the Society is planning a reprint of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> bound volumes for the years 1960 through 1979, in English only. These reprints will be produced as we are able to work them into our schedule. It is our intention to make these available five volumes at a time. Orders for the years 1960 through 1964 will be accepted during November.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The Society does not intend to stock a supply of these reprint volumes. Therefore, we urge all to consider the matter carefully and place orders for what they need. If congregations decide to stock one or two volumes for future needs, these should be paid for out of the congregation cash account and not kept on the shelf at the Society’s expense. Since these are controlled stock items, they are to be paid for upon receipt. The price will be $6.00 each. The Literature Order form (S-14 6/87) lists the volumes that are available for ordering at this time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Congregations and individuals desiring to have these volumes for their library should determine the total number of volumes they desire for each year and submit their request through the congregation. The total quantity should be entered on the Literature Order form (S-14) and be submitted during the month of November. The reprint volumes will be shown as back ordered on the congregation invoice until they are shipped.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The Society will announce each group of bound volumes to be made available. Please be guided by such future announcements, and place your orders accordingly. At this time, do not place orders other than for the five years now being made available. The presiding overseer and the secretary should make sure that everyone has an opportunity to order the volumes desired and see that this order is placed during the month of November.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We trust that these </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">reprints will enhance the value of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index </span><span class="font11">1930-1985 by making available many spiritual treasures the organization has provided.</span></p></li></ul>

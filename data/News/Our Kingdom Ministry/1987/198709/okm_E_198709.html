<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Study the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:16, 17—It is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:3—Provides knowledge that leads to everlasting life.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach&gt;a Release to the Captives</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">’ One person with a science background who read </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font13"> said: “I am stunned by the clarity and power of this new book. I think that it’s the finest science book I’ve ever read for building appreciation for life. It’s very sophisticated scientifically, yet on a level that anyone can appreciate.” Many must have had similar feelings, since it was necessary to print more than 12,600,000 copies during the first 20 months of publication! What was your reaction upon reading it?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Satan has used many schemes as well as “teachings of demons” to blind people’s minds. (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Cor. 4:4) One such teaching is the doctrine of evolution, and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book is just what is needed to help us “preach a release” to those who are held captive by this Goddishonoring theory. (Luke 4:18) During September we will offer the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book extensively in our ministry. Though its value is inestimable, we offer it for a contribution of only $2.50. A small-size edition is offered for $1.25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERTURNING “STRONGLY ENTRENCHED THINGS&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The evolution theory is one of the “strongly entrenched things,” yes, a “lofty thing raised up against the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Set Goals to Help Keep Your Faith Strong</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Strong faith in Jehovah and in his Kingdom rule by Christ Jesus is necessary if we are to be pleasing to God. (Heb. 11:6) It makes possible a good relationship with him, and it sustains the hope of everlasting life. But as the apostle Paul explained, “faith is not a possession of all people.” Since we know that without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to God and that lives are at stake, there are good reasons for us to maintain a strong faith as we face “the conclusion of the system of things.”—2 Thess. 3:2; Matt. 24:3, 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What might help us to keep our faith strong during the new service year? Theocratic goals can help toward that end. When reasonable goals are set in connection with the field ministry and in other areas of life, much can be accomplished to our own benefit and to the glory of our heavenly Father.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE MINISTRY AND IN PERSONAL STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Our individual accomplishments in the ministry may vary greatly. Yet, knowledge of God.” (2 Cor. 10:4, 5) But Jehovah knows exactly what we need in order to reach all sorts of people, and he has provided us with powerful spiritual weapons to overturn such reasonings. (1 Tim. 2:4) After reading the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book, a college professor who says he is an atheist had to admit: “I have never before seen such a well-presented argument for creation.” Some educators and college students have been willing to accept the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font13">book although refusing our other publications. Why not make an effort to reach such people in your territory with this offer? Excellent results have been realized by those doing so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REACHING ALL WITH </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CREATION</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Have you school-age publishers offered the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book to your teachers and fellow students? Why not do so during September? Have you offered a copy of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font13">book to your Bible students? Even though they are studying another publication, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book will help strengthen their faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font13"> book offer goes well with our Topic for Conversation “Why Study the Bible?” You might say something like this: “Many </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font13"> 3) earnest service, even though limited by circumstances beyond our control, is pleasing to Jehovah. This was illustrated by a certain needy widow’s whole-souled contribution of two small coins. (Luke 21:1-4) Still, there may be ways each one can progress in the ministry during the new service year. For example, some may be able to spend more time in the ministry each month. Could you arrange a schedule that would allow you to auxiliary pioneer a month or more at some time during the year? Or could you perhaps work toward becoming a regular pioneer? Definite plans made now may help you to achieve such a goal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Another important goal is to gain more from personal study. In order to accomplish this, you could arrange to read through the Bible by a certain time. You could set aside a specific time each week for personal study and then stick to your schedule. To help you absorb the material more fully and make it your own, use it in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 4, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col.</span><span class="font13"> I)</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

Soon the construction company used for the first stage of the work will turn the structure over to the Society.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> A Christian responsibility we all can share is to show consideration for our older brothers and sisters. As the years go by, these dear ones may encounter physical problems. Because of factors beyond their control, some are not able to accomplish as much as they once did in Jehovah’s service. (Eccl. 12:1-6) And as with the rest of us, they too feel the many pressures of this old system of things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The Word of God points out that the primary responsibility for caring for the older ones lies with family members. (1 Tim. 5:8) Yet we, individually and as a congregation, must also “show consideration for the person of an old man.”—Lev. 19:32.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As Jehovah’s organization grows and new congregations are formed, some older ones find themselves in congregations where there are few who know them well. Realizing the effort they make to attend, do we greet them or try to get better acquainted by taking the initiative to start a conversation? Have we visited them in their homes? Or do we keep in touch by telephone when this is appropriate? Have we called not only to ask how they are but also to see if there is something we could do for them? Do they need transportation, someone to run errands, or help with necessary business matters? It is commendable that some in the congregations are doing these things, but are there more of us who may be in a position to show such brotherly concern? (Compare Luke 10:36, 37.) Showing consideration for older ones is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font13"> privilege that can be shared by all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The elders can keep the congregation informed as special needs arise. But individually we can offer to help</span></p></li></ul>

Do they need someone to read to them or to take them out in service, even though they can share only in a limited way? Do we take time to visit our brothers and sisters who are in nursing homes or who are otherwise confined because of physical problems?—Prov. 3:27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> As foretold in God’s Word, many people today are ‘disobedient to parents, unthankful and disloyal, with no natural affection.’ (2 Tim. 3:2, 3) But as Christians, we want to avoid the self-centered spirit of the world. We do not want to be too busy to enjoy the company of older ones who are fine examples in love and devotion to Jehovah. Their faithfulness in attending meetings and sharing in field service to the extent they are able brings encouragement, especially if we appreciate the effort they put forth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTITUDE OF OLDER ONES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Never should older ones be made to feel that they have become a burden to the congregation or that they are no longer appreciated, just because their energies have diminished and they cannot do as much as they did before. On the other hand, it is wonderful to see an appreciative spirit on the part of older ones. It is commendable when they do not become critical or demanding. A positive attitude on their part helps them to avoid having a complaining spirit, knowing that Jehovah can help them to endure the trials that come with advancing age. As a congregation and as individuals, we want to continue to show loving consideration for the faithful older ones in our midst.—Compare Hebrews 10:32-34.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">people are interested in knowing how man got here and where he is going. Do you think the Bible answers such questions? [Allow response.] We have found that it can do so because it is God’s inspired Word. Notice this point at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. [Read.] The evolution theory offers no hope beyond this present life, whereas the Bible holds out the promise of everlasting life. You will find that promise at John 17:3. [Read.]” Then offer the book, pointing out that it will show how man got here and how he can live forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing Informally</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> While resting at Jacob’s well near Sychar, Jesus initiated a conversation with a Samaritan woman. (John 4:5-30) Though tired and thirsty from traveling, he gave a witness about the truth. It was an informal witness. Did it have good results? Most certainly! It led to many Samaritans’ putting faith in Jesus. (John 4: 39-42) What a fine witness and what surprising results from that one informal conversation!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Many today find informal witnessing an excellent way to spread the good news, and as a result, they have enjoyed thrilling experiences. Informal witnessing can be very productive. But you may ask </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">where</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font13"> one can witness informally. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font13"> can it be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE AND WHEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> One can witness informally in almost any set of circumstances or at any location. The important thing is to look for opportunities while going about our daily routine. Many publishers witness informally when going to and from work on public transportation or when traveling on vacation. Some take advantage of lunch breaks. Others look for appropriate occasions while shopping. One couple witnessed to the butcher at a supermarket, and when he showed interest in the truth, they arranged to continue the discussion at his home that same evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Infirm or ill publishers have had good success witnessing to visitors, medical personnel, and hospital attendants. (See w79 10/15 pp. 24-6.) Some brothers speak to visitors who call at their home. Others have had fine results approaching people en-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> A goal young ones should consider for the coming school year is to give an effective witness to teachers and classmates. Speaking of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School </span><span class="font13">brochure, one young Witness said: “It has made it a lot easier for us to talk to teachers and fellow students about our beliefs.&quot; Have you tried using this same method? You may have to muster courage, but you can be confident Jehovah will bless your efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> You young ones, make it a goal not to let unwholesome influences such as bad association, drugs, and immorality adversely affect you durjoying the warm weather in public areas. Museums, airline or bus terminals, and other public facilities have proved to be excellent places for informal witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> One Gilead student, a little nervous about witnessing informally, said: “I have often found that prayer helps when it is difficult for me to talk to people.” So look for ways to speak to people, and ask Jehovah to open the way. Then let zeal for Jehovah and the truth motivate you. Be friendly and warm when you approach individuals. Try to establish eye contact, and start a conversation on something that may be of mutual interest. Be considerate and kind, even if the person is not interested.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Of course, if possible, we want to leave an interested person with something to read. This means we should plan ahead and have tracts, magazines, booklets, or brochures available. Our new smaller-size tracts should prove to be valuable aids in informal witnessing. Some publishers have had excellent success in starting conversations by leaving brochures or magazines on their desk at work or on a table in their home. Such may catch the eye of a workmate or visitor and lead to an interesting discussion and fruitful witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Look for ways to witness informally. Carry tracts or other literature with you, and ask Jehovah to help you. Arrange to follow up all interest. Be sure to report the time as field service. By putting forth the effort as Jesus and the apostles did, Jehovah will bless you too in spreading the good news through informal witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">ing the months ahead! Review the material in the August issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> on using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font13"> brochure, and let this help you through the tests of integrity you may face while at school.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> There may be various aspects of your life and ministry that you would like to improve. Reaching goals set for yourself and your family will require a measure of sacrifice. But when you consider that the things of this world are “passing away,” you will want to make every effort to gain God’s approval. (1 John 2:17) So as you reflect on the past service year and look ahead to the new one now beginning, be determined to keep your own faith and that of your family strong. Set goals for yourself, and strive diligently to reach them.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">• Is</span><span class="font13"> it proper to circulate among the brothers private material on matters such as medical or counseling services?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With relation to Christian conduct, the apostle Paul wrote that the ‘congregation is a pillar and support of the truth.’ (1 Tim. 3:15) Thus, the congregation is not to be a channel for distribution of private material, whether through specially arranged meetings at the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere or in printed form or audio and video tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> have offered fine information and advice on dealing with medical problems and on upholding God’s law about blood. They have also had Scripturally balanced articles on fears, depression, and other emotional problems. These articles have been provided to inform. But they do not endorse certain types of diagnosis, therapy, doctors, counselors, or treatment centers, as personal decisions must be made on such matters.—See u)82 6/15 pp. 22-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Since there are many of Jehovah's Witnesses, some persons, including our brothers, have tried to promote their business and viewpoints by preparing articles, brochures, and tapes directed to those in the organization. These may be on topics of interest or concern, but why are they circulated? To develop clients, customers. Even if some are not distributed to gain business, they may well contain private views put in ‘theocratic language’ with Bible citations. Whether prepared by a Witness or not, the views may not be in line with the Bible and the Scriptural counsel given by elders butmay be based on philosophy or the elementary things of the world. —Col. 2:8; 1 Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Problems and confusion have resulted because brothers and sisters innocently passed on such privately prepared material. All of us, especially the elders, who work in harmony with “the faithful and discreet slave” and who are looked to for guidance, should want to avoid contributing to such difficulties. (Matt. 24:45) Nor should we promote someone’s business or ideas and philosophy by circulating such material among the brothers.—See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 6/77 p. 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” Those words of Psalm 110:3 well describe Jehovah’s active organization today as men, women, and children zealously share in proclaiming the Kingdom good news. During the month of December, many family members will have excellent opportunities to expand their ‘willing service’ by increasing their share in the field ministry. If we are to ‘buy out the opportune time,’ we will need to make definite plans and carefully schedule our time in advance.—Col. 4:5; 1 Cor. 9:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Why not make witnessing a family project? Sit down together and determine the possibilities for increased field service during the month of December. With all family members contributing their expressions, you may be pleasantly surprised at how much good can be accomplished. —Prov. 11:14; 15:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Many young ones can take full advantage of time off from school to engage in the field service during the worldly holiday season. If you are a student, can you join the many other youths who will be auxiliary pioneering in December? If so, you will enjoy many rich blessings. Mothers may find that having the children out of school provides an excellent opportunity to devote more time to field service with their children. Is it possible for you fathers and mothers to auxiliary pioneer with your children? Or, with all family members working together, can you help at least one or perhaps more members of the family to auxiliary pioneer? Will you make a special effort to engage in field service each weekend during December? How encouraging and unifying this would be for all in your family!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Experience has shown that December is an especially productive month for preaching the good news.

Whereas it is true that some expansion into outlying areas has been difficult or impossible because the brothers have not been able to build or otherwise provide appropriate Kingdom Halls in those areas, the problem the organization faces today primarily is found in the urban areas where </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">property v</span><span class="font14">alne« havp skyrocketed to such an extent that individual congregations, including large ones, have been unable to purchase even a site for the construction of a Kingdom Hall.

Although more Kingdom Halls are needed, it is preferable that skilled craftsmen not be asked to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">work with more than one Regional Building Committe</span><span class="font14">e. Many of the brothers have congregation and family responsibilities and these cannot be neglected. For the sake of maintaining </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">proper balance</span><span class="font14"> in these and other matters, this seems to be the reasonable course. (Phil. 1:9,10; 4:5, 6) It may be that some congregations planning to build will be </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">asked to dela</span><span class="font14">y their project for a while so that the schedule for Regional Building Committees does not become overloaded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CURRENT NEEDS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah’s people are a forward-looking people. It is obvious that Jehovah is bringing the increase. Last service year the number of congregations in the United States increased by 211. This is more than four each </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">week</span><span class="font14">! We must anticipate the needs of this harvesttime. No doubt the continued generous spirit of giving on the part of the brothers will allow the Society Kingdom Hall Fund to provide financing for more Kingdom Halls across the country. The </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">funds</span><span class="font14"> that have been contributed for the advancement of the Kingdom Hall construction work are an e</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">vidence</span><span class="font14"> that Jehovah’s faithful </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">servants are quick to see a need and</span><span class="font14"> are willing t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o meet that need</span><span class="font14"> in a whole-souled manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> It is certainly most commendable that many congregations have eliminated extra or unnecessary features from their construction plans and in this way have reduced costs. It can be observed from the Kingdom Halls shown in this insert that c</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ongregations have built modestl</span><span class="font14">y, though attractively, and thus have not imposed a burden upon their brothers who assist with construction or upon the resources of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. (Phil. 2:4) Regional Building Committees are encouraged to give suggestions to this end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>14</sup> As congregations have come to hear of the needs of their brothers in other places, they have responded just as the Corinthians did in the first century when they heard of the needs of their Judean brothers. Paul encouraged them to volunteer assistance in a material way. He wrote: ^‘Nevertheless, just as you are abounding in everything, in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in this love of ours to you, may you also abound in this kind giving.”)(2 Cor. 8:7) Thus Paul associates the giving of needed funds with faith and knowledge and love, and encourages such giving. He reminded the Corinthians of the principle that to </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">sow sp</span><span class="font14">aringly is tn reap </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">sparingl</span><span class="font14">y and then </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">encourage</span><span class="font14">d themk^Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”/Although giving was entirely voluntary, </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">no one needed to feel he could not share</span><span class="font14">, for Paul said:Q‘God, moreover, is able to make all his undeserved kindness abound toward you, that, while you always have full self-sufficiency in everything, you may have plenty for every good work.”4-2 Cor. 9:6-9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said: “Everyone that hears these sayings of mine and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">does</span><span class="font13"> them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rockmass.” (Matt. 7:24) Getting the sense of Jesus’ words and being properly motivated will cause one to produce fine works, including preaching the good news. Such rightly motivated obedience provides a rocklike foundation that will not wash away during storms of adversity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> It is for good reason that we want to help one another share in the preaching work to the fullest extent permitted by our individual circumstances. Some among us are irregular publishers, and this is of much concern. What could cause one to let an entire month go by without having some share in the vital preaching and disciple-making work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some may have been seriously ill, and others may have put off field service until late in the month, only to find themselves caught up in unforeseen circumstances that prevented them from getting out in service. Others may lack appreciation for the ministry as a treasure of service that should be given priority. (2 Cor. 4:7) Pressure from an unbelieving mate or other relatives has been a discouraging factor at times. A failure to maintain good personal study habits and regularity in meeting attendance has affected still others, so that they lost their sense of urgency regarding the nearness of the end of Satan’s world. (2 Pet. 3:11, 12) Something has affected their heart. Therefore they are not motivated to speak out of its abundance. (Matt. 12:34) Whatever the reason, we want to help them.</span></p></li></ul>

They may also address the problem when considering local needs for the Service Meeting. The secretary should note any trend toward irregularity in field service when posting the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT BOOK STUDY CONDUCTORS CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Each month the secretary should provide Congregation Book Study conductors with a list of those who fail to report field activity, so that prompt assistance can be given. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> for May 1984, page 7.) The study conductor should kindly approach irregular ones to ascertain what may be hindering them and how he can be of assistance. (Prov. 27:23) Most irregular ones will appreciate help. After getting to know the person’s circumstances, the conductor should make definite arrangements to work personally with him or to have another mature publisher or pioneer do so. Giving irregular ones practical suggestions on preparing a schedule suited to their individual circumstances may also be helpful. Can they plan to share regularly in field service the first Sunday of each month or on the second and fourth Saturdays? If transportation is a problem or they need help with small children, the conductor can enlist the aid of other willing publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When visiting the book study groups, the service overseer can make arrangements to call on irregular ones with the study conductor. Thus two mature brothers will be able to share in giving counsel and then help such ones to build a rocklike foundation of obedience to Christ’s command to preach and make disciples. They may thus be motivated to place the preaching work high on their list of priorities. (Rom. 10:10) Let us exert ourselves in this way to show our love for “those related to us in the faith.’’ i —Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Effective Introductions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Much good can be accomplished in our field ministry if we have prepared effective introductions. If we do not get the attention of the householder at the outset so as to start a conversation or place literature with him, we may not stimulate sufficient interest to warrant a return visit with the goal of starting a home Bible study. Therefore, much depends on how effective our opening words are. How can we make our introductions more effective?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE OF INTRODUCTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> To start with, we must have clearly in mind the purpose of introductions. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font13">says: “The introduction . . . should arouse interest in the subject. It ought to capture the attention of your audience and prepare them to give favorable consideration to what follows.” The book adds: “One of the best ways to arouse interest ... is to get your audience involved.” (See page 113, paragraphs 1 and 2.) How can we do this in the field ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The introductions found on pages 9-15 in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book were prepared with the foregoing in mind. Analyze these. Note how they have been designed to capture interest and direct the attention of the householders to the subjects being considered. Many have used the introductions in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font13">book with good results. One sister said that by using a variety of introductions, her field service has become more enjoyable and she has been made more conscious of trying to engage people in conversations. Concerning the suggestions in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, she said: “They really work.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What introductions have you found effective with the current Topic for Conversation? Have you tried those listed under the heading “Bible/God” on page 10 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book? One of them can be used with our current Topic for Conversation as follows: “I am glad to find you at home. I am sharing with my neighbors an encouraging thought from the Bible. Have you ever wondered what makes religion have real value with God?” Another introduction could be: “We are encouraging folks to read their Bible. The answers that it gives to important questions often surprise people. For example, notice how 2 Timothy 3:1, 2, and 5 shows why God does not accept some of the worship engaged in by religious people.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> You may find it appropriate to use other introductions in addition to those included in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. Much will depend on the types of persons you meet in your territory. However, you will find it beneficial to follow the pattern of the introductions given in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. They present issues that concern people. They get the householder involved in the conversation. They are brief and to the point. There is much benefit in carefully examining the introductions presented in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, even if at times your territory may call for introductions not included in the book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">. <sup>6</sup> On the other hand, using the introductions in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book word for word has been very effective. Some have read appropriate introductions directly from their </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book when speaking over the intercom in high-security buildings. This has enabled them to be fluent and to the point, and to capture the householder’s attention. They have been invited into the building to continue the conversation. In one large city, this method has been the most effective means of reaching people in high-security buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> We want to keep in mind how important our opening words are in the field ministry. So much depends on their effectiveness. Like Solomon, we too should thoroughly search for delightful words as we prepare to use effective introductions in our house-to-house work. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book will help us in this search.—Eccl. 12:9, 10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We rejoice greatly that Jehovah has given us “the tongue of the taught ones.” (Isa. 50:4) The Theocratic Ministry School has been an important teaching instrument that Jehovah has used to provide us with theocratic education for more than 44 years. Now we have our new Theocratic Ministry School Schedule. Have you carefully reviewed the instructions for the school during 1988?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The No. 1 assignment, Bible highlights, and No. 2 talk will follow the same pattern as during the previous year. But talks No. 3 and 4 will differ in that they will take us into two teaching aids we use extensively in the field ministry, namely, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The No. 3 talk will be based alternately on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book. When based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book, it should be assigned primarily to sisters who are new in the truth or younger in years. This will give them valuable experience and familiarity with this field instrument. The No. 4 talk will be regularly based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font13">book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As we prepare for the school each week, our progressively covering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book will enable us to become much more familiar with what it contains, and then we will more readily think of using it when questions or objections arise. This will help us to become more effective in the field ministry as our educated tongue speaks the truth with greater persuasiveness.—Compare Acts 17:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>

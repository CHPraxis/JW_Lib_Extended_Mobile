</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> first appeared in July 1879, only 6,000 copies were printed once a month in just one language. Now, 107 years later, over 12 million copies of each issue are printed, most of them semimonthly, in 103 languages. Such growth gives evidence of Jehovah’s approval of this instrument that he is using for making known the truth regarding his Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Whether you have been reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> for a relatively short time or you have read it for many years, we are confident that you appreciate the spiritual benefits received. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> has brought you a Scriptural hope. It has strengthened your trust in the Kingdom of God as the only means by which lasting peace will come to our earth. It has alerted you to the dangers of these critical times that mark “the last days.” (2 Tim. 3:1-5) Its pages have helped you to receive “comfort from the Scriptures” and reliable guidance based on God’s Word, the Bible. (Rom. 15:4; Ps. 119: 105) While reflecting on these and other benefits, are you not moved to tell others about the value of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtowerf</span><span class="font11"> During April, a one-year subscription will be offered for a contribution of just $4.00.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BE POSITIVE IN YOUR OUTLOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> God’s wisdom and not human reasoning is stressed in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Such wisdom is desperately needed by everyone today. It can improve lives and help develop right motives. This is necessary in order to “keep living.” (Prov. 9:1-6) Being thus convinced, we will offer the subscription with a positive attitude, recognizing that we have what others need. Carefully go over each issue to find statements that you believe may be helpful to householders. Such advance preparation will aid you in reflecting a positive spirit when presenting these magazines in the ministry.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"> “We cannot stop speakin</span><span class="font11">g about the things we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4:20) This expression of the apostles </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Pete</span><span class="font11">r and John revealed that the p</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">reaching</span><span class="font11"> of the good news was an </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">essential part of their lives</span><span class="font11">. Concerning all the apostles, the bible account tells us thaty‘</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">every day</span><span class="font11"> in the temple and from house to nouse they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.”/-Acts 5:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> This </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">constancy</span><span class="font11"> in sharing the good news was also c</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">haracteristic of </span><span class="font11">the apostle </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Paul,</span><span class="font11"> who( “would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and. would persuade Jews and Greeks.”/(Acts 18:4) Even as a prisoner confined to his own house under guard, he would regularly preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom. —Acts 28:30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Regularly sharing the good news </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">brought many blessings and joys</span><span class="font11"> to our brothers in the first century. Some who were considered unlettered and ordinary </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">acquired boldness</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The cost of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> is minimal when compared with the value in benefits to the reader. So confidently present the subscription at every opportunity. Some publishers may wish to offer </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscriptions along with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> A one-year subscription to both magazines is $8.00, a small cost compared with that of many worldly publications.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Be determined to follow up all placements and endeavor to develop the interest shown. Some brothers work up magazine routes with those who take single issues of the magazines. If a person reads a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower or Awake.',</span><span class="font11"> he may become interested. So call back and present the next issues, highlighting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font11"> 3) </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">and skill</span><span class="font11"> as they imitated Jesus in their speaking. (Acts 4:13) What a joy it must have been to know that their teaching brought salvation to many honesthearted ones!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE ADVANTAGE OF</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEKLY SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A schedule for witnessing regularly each week can help you to enjoy such blessings. Our calendar specifies the first Sunday of each month as well as the s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecoricTahd fourth SatOr</span><span class="font11">-</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">davs a</span><span class="font11">s special days for the field ministry. Do you follow this schedule? By doing so and adding one more weekend, you would enjoy weekly participation in the field service. Many have arranged their affairs to share in service at least every weekend. Congregations arrange meetings for field service every Saturday and Sunday. Many of them have midweek arrangements as well.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">• When can a new Bible study be reported, and with whom may studies be counted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A new home Bible study may be reported as such when it has been conducted two times after the call on which the study arrangement was demonstrated and there is reason to believe that the study will continue. A Study Report form should be made out and turned in each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A return visit and the time spent are counted each time a home Bible study is conducted. If circumstances require that another publisher accompany the one who conducts the study, and if both share in the study in a meaningful way, both may count the time. However, only the conductor of the study will report the return visit and the Bible study. Ordinarily it should not be necessary for more than two publishers to be involved in teaching at a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Home Bible studies should be continued with new persons until they have completed studying the two books that will establish them in the truth, such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship of the Only True God.</span><span class="font11"> The study, return visits, and service time may be reported until completion of these two publications even if the person gets baptized before finishing both books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">tive. This is in keeping with the Society’s arrangement to build up such ones who desire help. In such a case, the study may be reported along with the related return visits and field service time.—Note </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font11"> pp. 103-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Parents are responsible before Jehovah to instruct and train their own children in right worship. (Deut. 4:9; Eph. 6:4) A regularly conducted family Bible study is most beneficial in this regard. A family head or parent may report a regularly conducted family Bible study if nonbaptized members are included. Up to one hour of service time and a return visit may also be counted each week that the study is conducted.—See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">km </span><span class="font11">6/83 p. 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Valuable Spiritual Food With Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> King David of Israel said in praise to Jehovah: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.” (Ps. 145:16) During this time of the end, Jehovah’s generous provision of spiritual food in due season makes us a well-fed and happy people. Like David, we are moved to praise Jehovah’s name because of his loving care for us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Having spiritual provisions in such abundance, it is natural that we would want to share what we have with others. For that reason, during the months of January and February, we will feature several of the older publications in our house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Congregations having any of the following publications in stock may offer them in the field at the special rate of 50&lt;t each or two for 81.00: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, Commentary on James, “Eternal Purpose,&quot; Evolution</span><span class="font16"> (old edition), </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Good News, Holy Spirit, Life Does Have a Purpose, Peace and Security</span><span class="font16"> (old edition), </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">This Life, Truth,</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">World Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT WE CAN HIGHLIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Make an effort to point out an interesting thought from the book you feature. For example, in making a brief presentation using the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font16"> book, you might say: “Just about everyone these days is concerned with the threat of nuclear war. However, the Bible tells us that God is going to cause wars to cease. [Read Psalm 46:8, 9.] That promise of abundant peace was written under inspiration of God’s holy spirit, the same holy spirit that is behind the worldwide peace that will be such a blessing to all mankind.” Then turn to page 163 and read paragraph 2. Refer to the title of the chapter to show that such peace has the backing of God’s holy spirit. Then offer the book on a contribution of 50e.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> If you plan to use the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font16"> book, after discussing the two texts in our Topic for Conversation, you might say: “All of us enjoy having the right to make a choice when something is offered to us. There are many choices when it comes to deciding what is the best way of life. Note, please, the first chapter of this book entitled ‘Making the Right Choice.’ [Read paragraph 3 on page 5.] This publication can help you to make the right choice. It is offered on a contribution of only 50e.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> January and February should see a large distribution of these older publications. Whichever publication you use, keep in mind that within its pages is found spiritual refreshment for those who are thirsting for truth. Placing one or more of these publications with an interested person opens the way for a return visit and perhaps a Bible study, for, indeed, these publications are what Jehovah has supplied through his organization to satisfy mankind.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The worldwide Miryice &lt;-epov4 for 1986 gives clear evidence that Jehovah’s people responded enthusiastically to the urging of the yeartext: “Go . . . , declare abroad the kingdom of God.” (L</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">uke 9.: 60</span><span class="font16">) It also shows that Jehovah has richly blessed our endeavors in the r</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">qjnis</span><span class="font16">-How happy we all are to nave a part in raising up a great shout of praise to Jehovah’s name! -P^klJL-2.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1987 &quot;Trust in Jehovah&quot; District Convention</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> In our times tremendous pressures are brought to bear on everyone. From every direction problems confront us. It certainly takes courage to keep going and it is not in our own strength that we can do this. (2 Cor. 4:7) As experience has shown, it is folly to trust in human wisdom respecting essential matters of life. (Ps. 146:3) To assist all of us in developing our trust in Jehovah and in learning practical ways to demonstrate this trust, the Society has arranged for many three-day “Trust in Jehovah” District Conventions in the contiguous United States during 1987. You will without fail enjoy Jehovah’s rich blessings as you arrange to be in attendance at one of these conventions designed to reinforce your determination to “trust in Jehovah with all your heart.”—Prov. 3:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> During the announcement period of the Service Meeting for the week of January 4, the letter from the Society dated December 15, 1986, will be read, informing each congregation of the convention it is assigned to attend. Following this Service Meeting, the elders will post on the congregation’s information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list that has been received from the District Convention Committee. This is a list of all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats, food, literature, and rooming accommodations for everyone. As you make your plans to be in attendance, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so they can attend every session as well. (Gal. 6:10) The program will start at 10:20 a.m. on Friday.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font1">As soon as your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses of the motels, their agreed-upon rates, and the phone numbers, you should IMMEDIATELY phone the motel of your choice, identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention, and make reservations. Doing so will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases will result in considerable savings, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of rooms. One night’s DEPOSIT will be required at all locations to hold the room and should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make your reservations. Do not make reservations you do not intend to use or reservations at more than one motel. (Compare Matthew 5:37.) MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD THE ROOMS OR EXTEND THE SPECIAL RATES BEYOND THE CUTOFF DATE WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your accommodations, you should notify the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available for other delegates. If the motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on. The convention Rooming Department will provide the congregation with revised lists as long as necessary, deleting motels that are filled and listing additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room. Do not accept rooms at a price higher than what is shown on the lodging list, even if the motel says the convention block is full. Try another motel on the list.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font1">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font1">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking those in fulltime service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf, or others, with them in their own group. They may also care for such ones in other ways. (Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3: 17, 18) Of course, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs who are unable to care for themselves or who cannot be assisted by those from the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should fill out this form. Afterward it should be returned to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the fact that their circumstances qualify them for special needs consideration. The convention coordinator then forwards the form to the convention Rooming Department and the individual will be notified directly about the accommodations. This should be done well ahead of the convention. Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Private home accommodations are usually set aside for those who have limited funds and who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper for delegates to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days so they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period only. Those receiving such accommodations are to see that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host and not damage anything, rummage through the host’s possessions, or enter private areas of the home. If any do so, their congregation’s elders will be advised.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font1">To reduce travel, district conventions are arranged at many locations. In nearly every case, the convention you are assigned to attend is the one nearest to your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if for some reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, please see your congregation’s convention coordinator for the address of the convention headquarters where you desire to attend. These addresses are listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then write to that convention headquarters and request a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, use it to make your reservations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> YOUR COOPERATION NEEDED: </span><span class="font1">The smoothness and success with which this rooming arrangement functions depends on the cooperation of everyone involved. Thus, we are asking everyone to cooperate with the Society’s rooming arrangement so as to avoid major difficulties in our negotiations.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1) Do not make reservations before the congregations receive the Recommended Lodging Locations list from the convention or try to make reservations for the next year while attending the current convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2) Do not make reservations with motels not on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3) Do not make reservations at more than one motel, and after arriving, check each one and then take the best one, canceling the others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4) Do not reserve rooms for others without giving deposits and names for each room.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> Such abuses are selfish and unloving. They not only make it difficult to negotiate for good rates at the motels but also bring reproach on Jehovah’s name and organization. The convention organization is working hard to save our brothers as much expense as possible, and so it is in the best interests of all for everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of goodquality accommodations and yet give preference to the motels that cooperate. Our aim with this arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so that they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION AT CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> Starting in 1978 the Society standardized and simplified district convention food service, volunteer service, rooming, and other arrangements, which resulted in the elimination of much work. In view of the pressures and demands made on our brothers by daily living, the Society is seeking further ways to simplify convention operations. Thus, more attention may be given to the spiritual aspects of the convention, and the workers will be able to enjoy more of the program. (Deut. 31: 12; compare Luke 10:38-42.) Additionally, as attendance continues to grow, the number of conventions and the resulting work involved in handling them increase. (Isa. 60:22) For these and other reasons that should be appreciated by everyone, the Society is simplifying the food service arrangements even further, along with arranging for three-day district conventions in 1987, as announced in the closing comments at the conventions last summer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> A great deal of work and expensive equipment have been needed in the past few years to provide hot foods on the menu for the district convention, and this also required that a number of volunteers in the Food Service Department work during the sessions. Additionally, some health departments have been quite extreme in their requirements for serving hot food, and this has been a burden to the brothers in charge. The Society’s large oven trailers must be fired by gas, and in view of the dangers involved, this has been of great concern not only to the Society but also to fire departments and managements of the buildings used. Oven trailers also require much maintenance, storage, and transportation that involve work, time, and expense. The Society, therefore, feels that it is wise, in view of these and other concerns, to simplify further the preparation of items on the menu at district conventions. This involves the elimination of the three hot items that were served. These will be replaced with appropriate cold items; however, the rest of the menu will be similar to what has been used in the past few years. This means there will no longer be a need for ovens with their gas and electrical hookups, Styrofoam chests to keep the food hot, other related equipment, and much of the kitchen help that was previously used, especially during the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>12</sup> The Society appreciates very much the fine support you brothers and sisters have been giving over the years to the food service arrangements at the district conventions. This has helped in many ways. It has been possible to rent good buildings and care for the convention expenses, and has enabled those attending to remain at the convention site during the short noon break so as to obtain meals conveniently, be refreshed, and then be present for the more important spiritual program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>13</sup> We realize the adjusted menu may appear to be somewhat limited, but with 14 or 15 items being served, it should provide sufficient sustenance for the morning and noon periods for three days. (Compare Matthew 14:14-20.) In many countries our brothers daily subsist on far less than we do in this country. Interestingly, on most work days, many hardworking brothers and sisters in this country take a cold lunch to work with them and then enjoy a warm meal in the evening. Although a few have brought their own cold food to conventions, it would be well to consider if it is necessary to make such an effort, since all that is involved at the convention would be breakfast and lunch for three days. Inasmuch cis the convention site actually becomes a large Kingdom Hall during the convention, it is also wise to avoid developing a picnic atmosphere by eating during the sessions. For the evening meal, brothers can make their own arrangements.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGN LANGUAGE SESSIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>14</sup> As you will note in the February 1, 1987, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> sign language translation will be provided only at 16 specific convention cities. (NO provision will be made at any other conventions for sign language.) We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good-quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers should let the deaf in their congregation know of the arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made by the Society.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TAPE RECORDINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>15</sup> No provision will be made by the Society for recording the program or the dramas either on audiotape or on videotape. Any individuals who make personal recordings for their own use should do so in such a way that it will not disturb or distract others in attendance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[NOTE TO THE BODY OF ELDERS: Please read the Society's convention assignment letter for your congregation, dated December 15, 1986, at your Service Meeting during the week of January 4 and post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list. (NO ONE, INCLUDING THE ELDERS, SHOULD CALL ANY MOTELS BEFORE THIS SERVICE MEETING.) Please read the assignment letter again at your next meeting and then post it on the information board. In this way all the congregations will receive the information the same week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The elder serving as the convention coordinator should conduct the first of the Service Meeting parts that cover this insert, as well as handle other convention-related material and announcements on future meetings. All elders will want to cooperate fully to ensure the prompt, enthusiastic, and effective handling of convention-related material.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Could More Start a Bible Study?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Are you presently conducting a home Bible study? If not, would you like to do so? Jesus emphasized that in addition to giving an initial witness, we must help interested persons grow spiritually. (John 4: 39-42) Field service reports, however, show that many publishers have never had the privilege of conducting a home Bible study. Some who have done so previously are not conducting a study now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> If we prepare for and conduct a Bible study on a regular basis, Jehovah will bless our endeavors. Ask those in the congregation who conduct productive Bible studies, and they will be quick to tell you of the great joy it brings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font16"> brochure that we received at last summer’s district convention is an excellent aid in starting Bible studies. While the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font16"> book is our primary study publication, we can first lay a fine foundation by studying through this brochure. Then we can interest the householder in a more detailed study in the book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO START A BIBLE STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> If sufficient interest is shown, there is no need to leave right after making a placement. A Bible study may be started right then. This can be done by reading together selected paragraphs and looking up and discussing key scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> In some cases, although the householder may not accept the literature offer, he may show respect and appreciation for the Bible. Wherever such interest is noted, it may be appropriate to continue the conversation. Perhaps arrange</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tract Distribution to Be Intensified</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> It was in 1880 that Jehovah’s Witnesses in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, began to publish and distribute informative Bible tracts. Today, over one hundred years later, tract distribution continues to be a part of our public ministry. Its importance is emphasized in the corporate title Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. —Matt. 24:14</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> In recent years a number of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font16"> tracts have been published. Some of these were designed to introduce newly released books. With others, special effort was made to reach everyone in our territory with a brief, timely message. Many publishers use tracts consistently, giving them to all friendly householders and usually leaving one at each door where no ments can be made to return and discuss the initial subject further or take up another Bible topic. Specific chapters of the Society’s publications, as well as portions of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font16"> book, provide a wealth of information for such Bible conversations. At a future date, it may be possible to introduce a publication and suggest a formal study arrangement.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> In addition to opportunities in the field ministry, have we endeavored to start Bible studies with neighbors, associates, or family members? While we may have done this previously, have we done so recently? Questions and concerns of workmates, schoolmates, and teachers may be progressively developed into Bible discussions and studies. A clear, concise, and encouraging Scriptural answer can demonstrate the value of the Bible. The study could be conducted at lunchtime, after work, after school, or whenever convenient, so as to help the individual to progress spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> Preparation is essential. When making a return visit, be sure to have clearly in mind the material you are going to discuss. In preparing for the call, it would be good to focus on how each discussion can contribute to your goal of starting a home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> Acts 20:35 helps us to appreciate that much joy and happiness come from sharing what we have with others. Conducting a home Bible study affords an excellent opportunity to experience that joy. Let us make it our goal to share in this service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">one is at home. All of this has been outstandingly successful, stimulating interest in the Kingdom message and alerting people to the Bible’s message for our times.—Ezek. 3:18, 19; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> In view of their proved effectiveness, a special effort will be made to increase tract distribution during the next few months. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font16"> No. 30 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Is Planet Earth Near the Brink?)</span><span class="font16"> will be used in January.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In a Tactful Way</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (Col. 4:6) What fine advice the apostle Paul gave! We do well to keep his counsel in mind as we share the truth with others.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN HOUSE-TO-HOUSE MINISTRY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Tact involves knowing what to do or say to maintain good relations with others and to avoid giving offense. In our door-to-door activity we meet people who tell us they are busy. If we see they are genuinely busy, we may just briefly offer the literature and tell them we would like to return on another occasion to talk with them. If they do not seem to be all that busy, we might say, “Then I will be brief.” Afterward, we can summarize what we had hoped to discuss, confining our comments to a minute or so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> At times we may meet householders who are rude. We do not want to be ill-mannered in our reply and “return evil for evil.” (Rom. 12: 17) We need to be tactful, paying attention to the reminder at Proverbs 15:1: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” The material on pages 15-24 of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font16"> book will help us to respond to householders in a mild, tactful way.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ON RETURN VISITS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Oftentimes when we call back on individuals who have taken literature, we find they have not looked into the publication at all. We want to encourage such people to read the literature they obtained. To do this we might tactfully point to interesting questions that the publication answers. This may whet their spiritual appetite and motivate them to look into the printed material they have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Many of us have had the experience of making a definite appointment for a return visit, only to find that the person was not at home when we called back. While this is disappointing and may have cost us time and effort, when we meet the person again we should still be tactful in what we say. We can tell him we were sorry we did not find him home and mention that we will put forth a special effort to call again and that we look forward to a further Bible discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ON BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Individuals do not always prepare for their studies. When this is the case, we might take a little time to show them how to prepare. Or we might point out some of the things they could learn by preparing ahead of time. The study would move along faster, and they would make more progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> An individual with whom we study may not be attending meetings as regularly as he should. We could discuss scriptures such as Psalm 133:1 or Hebrews 10:24, 25 and ask him how he understands these verses. Some publishers who came into the truth rather quickly may become impatient with those who make progress slowly. But we want to remember that individuals are not all alike, and so we need to exercise greater patience with some.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> Paul told Timothy that “a slave of the Lord . . . needs to be gentle toward all,... instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.” (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) If that is true of those “not favorably disposed,” those who have shown interest to the point of agreeing to study should certainly be dealt with in a mild and tactful way. This would include our children and others in our own family with whom we study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>9</sup> As we present the good news from house to house, on return visits, or at Bible studies, may all of us copy the fine example of the Great Teacher, Jesus, who said of himself, “I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (Matt. 11:29) We should display like qualities, being mild-tempered and tactful in our preaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tract Distribution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">metropolitan areas of the country. Congregations that have supplies of tracts already on hand should use these up. They may wish to absorb the cost for such tracts, or they may request credit from the Society if they so desire. Since these items will be out of stock in Brooklyn, congregations desiring a supply of tracts should check with other nearby congregations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Jesus foretold that his followers would face persecution and hatred even as he did. (John 15:20; Matt. 24:9) While we do face such trials, many also endure trials such as economic and health problems and difficulties on the secular job or at school. How can we joyfully cope with such trials?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> The theme of our next series of circuit assemblies beginning February 1987 will be “Joyfully Enduring Trials Brings God’s Approval.&quot; We will be helped to understand why we can expect trials, the benefits that come from enduring, and why we can be joyful. The public talk on the subject “You Can Enjoy Life in Peace Now” will be of special interest. The information presented will help interested persons appreciate the source of peace and how they can enjoy it now. All will want to make plans to be present both days.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Jesus found delight in doing his Father’s will, even though he faced persecution. By joyfully enduring trials to the point of death, he gained God’s approval. (Heb. 12:2) The new circuit assembly program will encourage us to copy his fine example.—1 Pet. 1:21.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Be sure to keep some on hand and offer a copy to business associates, people with whom you work, or teachers and fellow students at school. Offer them to relatives and neighbors as well. The tracts are particularly helpful when witnessing informally. New and younger publishers will find tract distribution to be a fine way to increase their share in spreading the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>

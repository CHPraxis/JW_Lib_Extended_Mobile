<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We Rejoice in New Peak of 746,956 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With one accord all of us, including many new ones, glorified Jehovah by giving a tremendous witness during April. (Rom. 15:6) A few encouraging highlights of the report are given below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 746,956. This all-time publisher peak is 2,037 over the number reporting last August, and 21,157 more than we had in April one year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliary and Regular Pioneers: These totaled 148,885, or 7,015 more than last April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 16,237,743. This is 823,855 hours more than our April 1986 peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits: 5,465,816. A 7-percent increase. 380,151 more than our previous peak reached last April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: 549,023. An increase of 7,741 over our peak In March of this year and a 4.5-percent increase over last April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We obtained a total of 152,275 new subscriptions during April. That was 12,471 more than during last October’s subscription campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is commendable to see that congregation publishers devoted more time to field service, averaging 10.1 hours per publisher for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely Jehovah is pleased with the effort put forth by new ones along with experienced publishers, old and young alike, In making known the good news and in bringing praise to him.—Ps. 145:12, 13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Study the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:16, 17—It is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:3—Provides knowledge that leads to everlasting life.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>‘Keep Our Maintaining</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Fine works are those activities directly related to God’s righteousness and the good news of salvation that is through Jesus Christ. Paul encouraged Titus to remind the brothers “to be ready for every good work” and “to make firm assertions constantly, in order that those who have believed God may keep their minds on maintaining fine works.” (Titus 3:1, 8) By keeping the good news to the fore and by conducting their lives in harmony with Jehovah’s righteous standards, the brothers would not be led astray. —Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Paul’s counsel applies to us today. Surrounded as we are by a wicked system of things that could easily turn our attention away from Jehovah’s service, we need to be on guard. That involves keeping our minds on maintaining fine works. How can we do that?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular Pioneering—Can You Begin in September?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> September marks the beginning of the 1988 service year. It will also be the first month of regular pioneer service for many. Will it be for you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Many have served as auxiliary pioneers during the 1987 service year. As stated in the June issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font14"> the auxiliary pioneer service could very well be a stepping-stone toward becoming a regular pioneer. If this is true in your case, why not begin in September? While it is good to have sufficient advance preparation, balance is also necessary so that this important personal goal does not elude you. Appropriately, the Scriptures admonish: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.”—Rom. 12:11.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We need to take advantage of the spiritual provisions Jehovah has made through the Christian congregation. (Heb. 13:20, 21) He has given us his Word, the Bible, along with an abundance of excellent study aids. Spiritually older men have been appointed to render personal assistance as shepherds of the flock. Regular weekly meetings at the Kingdom Hall and in private homes, as well as periodic larger assemblies and conventions, provide wholesome upbuilding association and faith-strengthening instruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Convenient arrangements for field service, including personal assistance for those who are less experienced, are made through the congregation. Such arrangements help us to be well equipped to carry out our </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font14"> 2) regular pioneer, you should follow Jesus’ admonition to “sit down and calculate the expense.” (Luke 14:28) Factors such as health, family obligations, age, and congregational responsibilities are to be considered. But if you have already analyzed your circumstances and have determined that with some adjustments you can be a regular pioneer, do not hold back.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUST IN JEHOVAH'S POWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> When considering your personal circumstances, do not conclude that just any handicap, disadvantage, or family responsibility will prevent you from being a successful pioneer. Likely you are acquainted with regular pioneers who serve in spite of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font14"> 5)</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font14">Regular pioneers should meet the requirement of 1,000 hours when enrolled for a complete service year, which begins on September 1 and ends August 31. Pioneers starting after the beginning of the service year should meet an hour requirement proportionate to the number of months remaining in that service year.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Unitedly Worshiping Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist captured well our feelings regarding the worldwide brotherhood unitedly worshiping Jehovah when he wrote: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (Ps. 133:1) By growing in accurate knowledge of the truth and being motivated to apply it daily in our lives, we all maintain ‘the same mind and the same line of thought.' (1 Cor. 1:10) Unity among us has been enhanced in recent years through use of the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship of the Only True God,</span><span class="font14"> released at the “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions in 1983. We should come to appreciate this outstanding publication even more as we consider it again at the Congregation Book Study beginning in September.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> All will benefit, whether we were in the congregation when the book was studied previously or we are among the thousands of new ones who have come into the truth since the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font14"> book was last considered in the Congregation Book Study. New ones will benefit from the varied comments and applications made by mature fellow believers. Local application of the material and points emphasized by experienced conductors will no doubt touch on areas of our personal life and ministry needing further attention. Since none of us are in the identical circumstances we faced when we studied the book previously, reviewing the information and applying the counsel in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship </span><span class="font14">book, as it relates to the problems and pressures we face today, will strengthen us as we continue to</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTIVITY FOR JULY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> July will be a busy month for most of us. Many will be attending the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention. Some will be working in unassigned territory. For many thousands, July is a month set aside for auxiliary pioneer service. All of us should be intent on doing what we can to place the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book and start Bible studies where possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If your schedule of activity for July includes travel away from home, likely you will have many opportunities to meet and talk with people on an informal basis. Many have found that by carrying a small-size </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font14">book, they have been encouraged and helped to strike up conversations “put up a hard fight for the faith.” —Jude 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Besides containing sound counsel that is encouraging and motivating, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font14"> book stimulates our appetite for spiritual knowledge. Our reasoning powers are strengthened by the way the information is presented. The questions at the bottom of the page, as well as the questions and scriptures within certain paragraphs, require deep thought and personal application on our part if we are to absorb the full sense of the material. Studying this book helps us develop thinking ability and improve our discernment of spiritual matters. We are helped to see the truth in its various aspects and to evaluate not only the relationship of one point to another but also how it applies to us personally. (Prov. 1:1-5) This helps us to “make sure of the more important things.”—Phil. 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> A key factor in benefiting fully is careful preparation. If you have considered the material in the past and already have the answers marked in your book, avoid thinking that careful preparation each week will not be necessary. From time to time all of us need to have our minds refreshed on these spiritual matters. The apostle Peter was inspired to remind the brothers concerning basic truths they had already learned. (2 Pet. 1: 12, 13; 3:1) Paul reminds us that such is for our spiritual safety. (Phil. 3:1) By examining the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font14"> book again, we will be strengthened to remain united in our worship of the only true God Jehovah in these critical last days.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">that often lead to giving a fine witness. Of course, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> also are convenient instruments to use when witnessing informally.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> In order to make your travel plans complete, be sure to include arrangements for attending meetings and perhaps sharing in field service with the local congregation. The June 1987 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> article “Include Meetings in Your Vacation Plans&quot; offered suggestions on how to locate the nearest Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Whether we are spending most of July with our home congregation or we are visiting in other areas, we will want to participate to the extent possible in congregation meetings and field activity. By “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” our minds will be directed aright, and we will maintain fine works to Jehovah’s praise.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On Enduring Trial” _______________________________________</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> All Christians have to face trials. (2 Tim. 3:12) Trials may come in the form of ill health, economic hardship, temptation, persecution, or in many other ways. Trials imposed by Satan are designed to slow us down, to cause us to neglect our Christian ministry, or even to stop us from serving God. (Job 1:9-11) How does enduring trials lead to happiness? —2 Pet. 2:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare for Trials: </span><span class="font13">Jehovah has provided his Word of truth, including a record of Jesus’ life and teachings. By hearing Jesus’ sayings and doing them, we lay a solid foundation and thus prepare for adversity. (Luke 6:47-49) We also draw strength from other provisions—our Christian brothers, congregation meetings, and Bible-based publications from the faithful and discreet slave class. We make liberal use of God's gift of prayer.—Matt. 6:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah has also given us a hope. When we build strong faith in Jehovah’s promises, our hope becomes “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm.” (Heb. 6:19) In Bible times, ships never left port without an anchor, even in good weather. If a storm suddenly came up, dropping the anchor could prevent the ship from being blown against a rocky shore. Similarly, building faith in God’s promises now will stabilize us when storms of trouble occur. Difficulties can arise very suddenly. Though the preaching activity of Paul and Barnabas was initially well-received in Lyst.ra, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on p. 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Earlier this year, congregations received a thrilling announcement: Starting in January 2008, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> will have two different editions, one for the public and the other for our Christian brotherhood! Perhaps you have been wondering: ‘How will the two magazines be different? What are the advantages of having separate editions? Are there any new features to look forward to?’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Differences: </span><span class="font13">The issue dated the first of the month will be known as the Public Edition. All the articles in this issue will be prepared with the public in mind. The issue dated the 15th of the month will be known as the Study Edition and will </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> be offered in field service. It will contain all the study articles needed for one month as well as secondary articles that are of particular interest to dedicated Christians. The Public Edition of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> not only will appeal to Witnesses but will especially appeal to non-Witnesses who may accept the Bible. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> on the other hand, will still be aimed at a broader audience, including skeptics and those who profess a non-Christian religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Advantages: </span><span class="font13">In the Study Edition, it will no longer be necessary to explain terms like “pioneer” in ways that non-Witnesses can grasp. This edition can also contain pointed information prepared especially for Jehovah’s Witnesses and Bible students who are making spiritual progress. What about the Public Edition? Since the subjects and the style of writing will be directed toward the public, a nonWitness should enjoy reading the magazine from cover to cover. Of course, every Witness of Jehovah will benefit from reading each issue. Because we will be offering just one </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> with one </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> in the field ministry each month, we will have an entire month to develop effective presentations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> New Features: </span><span class="font13">Some ex citing new features are planned for the Public Edition of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> One feature will discuss basic Scriptural teachings in a very simple format. Another will show how the Bible can help families. Bible study projects will be outlined for young people. Each issue will have an article highlighting specific Bible passages that teach us about Jehovah as a person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We pray that Jehovah will bless this new arrangement for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> May that journal, along with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font13">reach many more deserving ones with the good news. —Matt. 10:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Endurance Results in Happiness: </span><span class="font13">Remaining steadfast in the ministry despite opposition gives us peace of mind. We rejoice when we are counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of Christ. (Acts 5:40, 41) Enduring trials helps us to develop the qualities of humility, obedience, and endurance more fully. (Deut. 8:16; Heb. 5:8; Jas. 1:2, 3) It teaches us to rely on Jehovah, to trust in his promises, and to take refuge in him.—Prov. 18:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We know that trials are temporary. (2 Cor. 4:17, 18) Trials provide us with opportunities to demonstrate the depth of our love for Jehovah. By enduring them, we can provide an answer to Satan’s accusations. Therefore, we do not give up! “Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life.&quot;—Jas. 1:12.</span></p>

Where interest is shown, offer the tract </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font13"> with the objective of starting a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Since September has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer. ■ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “What Marks the Bible as Authentic?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">at least 30 days</span><span class="font13"> before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation’s Publisher Record</span><span class="font13"> (S-21) card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31, 2007, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Inventory</span><span class="font13"> (S-18) form. The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Inventory</span><span class="font13"> forms. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Please mail the original to the branch office no later than September 6.</span><span class="font13"> Keep a copy for your files. The third form may be used as a work sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">each month</span><span class="font13"> before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">■ What are the dangers of using the Internet to associate with someone we do not know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A number of Web sites have been designed for people to meet and correspond over the Internet. Many of these sites allow individuals to create and post their own profile, which may include pictures and other personal information. People who view the profile can then make contact. Such Web sites are very popular among young people, and some youths in the congregation have used them to interact with others who claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is easy for a person whom we meet over the Internet to be deceptive about his identity, his spirituality, or his motives. (Ps. 26:4) An individual claiming to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses may actually be an unbeliever, a dlsfel-lowshipped person, or even an active apostate. (Gal. 2:4) Reportedly, many pedophiles use such Web sites to find their victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even if we are convinced that those with whom we are corresponding are in good standing in the congregation, conversations in such a setting can easily drift toward unwholesome material. This is because people tend to be less inhibited with individuals they have not met personally. They may also view online communication as private and feel that whatever they say will not come to the attention of others, such as their parents or the elders. Sadly, a number of youths from Christian households have been ensnared and have become involved in obscene speech. (Eph. 5:3, 4; Col. 3:8) Others have included sexually provocative pictures of themselves, suggestive nicknames, or links to sexually explicit music videos in their computer profile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In view of the foregoing, parents should monitor their children’s activity on the computer. (Prov. 29:15) It would be dangerous to invite a stranger into our home or to allow him to be alone with our children. Similarly, it is dangerous for us or our children to make friends with strangers over the Internet, even if they claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.—Prov. 22:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why We Go Back Again and Again</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In many places, we cover our territory quite frequently. We continue to go back to the same houses again and again, though the householder may have told us he is not Interested. Why do we keep speaking to those who have not responded favorably in the past?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Love for Jehovah and for People: </span><span class="font13">The primary reason we persevere in the ministry is our love for Jehovah. Our heart moves us to continue telling others about our great God. (Luke 6:45) Our love for Jehovah impels us to obey his commands and help others to do the same. (Prov. 27:11; 1 John 5:3) Our enduring faithfully in this work does not depend upon the response of the people. Even when first-century Christians were persecuted, they continued preaching “without letup.” (Acts 5:42) When people refuse to listen, rather than allowing this to discourage us, we remain steadfast, demonstrating the depth of our love and devotion to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We also persevere because we love our neighbor. (Luke 10: 27) Jehovah does not want </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">any </span><span class="font13">to be destroyed. (2 Pet. 3:9) Even in frequently worked territory, we are still finding those who want to serve Jehovah. For example, in Guadeloupe, where 1 out of every 56 people is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 214 were baptized last year. Almost 20,000 attended the Memorial, about 1 for every 22 people in Guadeloupe!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. What question arises regarding our preaching work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. What is the primary reason we persevere in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. How will love for people help us to continue preaching?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Changes in the Territory: </span><span class="font13">The makeup of our territory is constantly changing. The next time we call where there was no favorable response, a different member of the family—perhaps one who has never heard our message—may open the door and listen. Or we may find new occupants who are interested. Children with opposed parents grow up and leave home. Such ones may be willing to hear the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> People also change. The apostle Paul was once “a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.” (1 Tim. 1:13) Likewise, many who are serving Jehovah today were at one time not interested in the truth. Some may have even opposed the good news at one time. As world conditions change, some opposers or those who were indifferent may be moved to listen. Others may be more responsive after experiencing a personal tragedy, such as a death in the family, the loss of employment, a financial prob lem, or a health issue.</span></p></li>

(Isa. 60:22) Therefore, we continue to preach with enthusiasm and strive to maintain a positive attitude. The next Individual we speak with may listen. We need to keep on speaking! ‘By doing this we will save both ourselves and those who listen to us.’—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

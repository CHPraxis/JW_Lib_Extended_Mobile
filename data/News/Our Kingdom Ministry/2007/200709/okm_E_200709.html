<p><span class="font14">Sksz </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ffingdomUSaMis/tertt:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We rejoice to see the progress of the work in the United States branch territory during the 2007 service year! We reached an all-time peak of 103,648 regular pioneers in December. A number of Beth-elites have been reassigned to the field as special and regular pioneers, and they are having a positive effect on the preaching work. The branch office also oversees the work in the Turks and Caicos is-, lands. The 161 publishers and pioneers reporting there in March conducted 307 Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nearly 51 million copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 37, “The End of False Religion Is Near!” were distributed throughout the United States branch territory. After receiving and reading a copy, an inactive sister had trouble sleeping. The next Sunday, she attended the meeting and requested a Bible study. Interested ones used the coupon on the back of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> to request 2,286 copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on the Watch!</span><span class="font11"> brochure and 1,087 Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The objective of such campaigns is to help honestheart-ed ones to learn what the Bible really teaches. (Matt. 28:19, 20) As you preach, remember to take note of any interest found, and return with the goal of starting a Bible study. We are happy to be working shoulder to shoulder with you in this important activity, and we send our warm Christian love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching Out in Our Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul admonished Christians to walk in God’s way and to “keep on doing it more fully.” (1 Thess. 4:1) What does this involve for us? One thing is that we should continually look for ways to reach out for more spiritual activity, endeavoring always to be ‘fully accomplishing our ministry.’ —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Motive: </span><span class="font11">Reaching out in our ministry stems from our desire to serve our Creator more fully. We want to grow spiritually and look for ways to improve our ministry. A good routine with proper motive will help us attain theocratic goals.—Ps. 1:1, 2; Phil. 4:6; Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Working at expanding our ministry requires that we cultivate a giving, selfsacrificing spirit. Such a spirit can be cultivated by prayerfully meditating on Jesus’ fine example. (Matt. 20:28) Jesus received great joy from serving others throughout his ministry. (Acts 20:35) We can imitate Jesus by showing personal interest in people and being alert to opportunities to reach out in our ministry. —Isa. 6:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Role of Parents: </span><span class="font11">A desire to serve others and expand our ministry can </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font11"> instilled in children at an early age. Young ones will take note of the diligence of family members and their active participation in expanding their ministry. One brother was motivated to reach out as a young boy as a result of working along with his grandfather on theocratic projects. Seeing his grandfather’s diligence and joy moved him to seek opportunities to serve his brothers. He is now a ministerial servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Need for Brothers: </span><span class="font11">“If any man is reaching out..., he is desirous of a fine work.” (1 Tim. 3:1) These words encourage brothers to reach out to qualify for further service privileges in Jehovah’s organization. Doing so does not require special skills or outstanding natural abilities. A brother reaching out will seek first the Kingdom and have a zealous share in the ministry. (Matt. 6:33; 2 Tim. 4:5) He will endeavor to be a good example for others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Worldwide: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering. (Isa. 60:22) There is an urgent need for all those following Jesus’ example to work at their ministry more fully. The worldwide report for the 2006 service year shows that 248,327 were baptized. That represents an average of over 680 new ones every day! May we all continue to look for ways to work at our ministry more fully.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">■ Does “the faithful and discreet slave” endorse independent groups of Witnesses who meet together to engage in Scriptural research or debate? —Matt. 24:45,47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No, it does not. And yet, in various parts of the world, a few associates of our organization have formed groups to do independent research on Bible-related subjects. Some have pursued an independent group study of Biblical Hebrew and Greek so as to analyze the accuracy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> Others explore scientific subjects related to the Bible. They have created Web sites and chat rooms for the purpose of exchanging and debating their views. They have also held conferences and produced publications to present their findings and to supplement what is provided at our Christian meetings and through our literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Throughout the earth, Jehovah’s people are receiving ample spiritual instruction and encouragement at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions, as well as through the publications of Jehovah’s organization. Under the guidance of his holy spirit and on the basis of his Word of truth, Jehovah provides what is needed so that all of God’s people may be “fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought” and remain “stabilized in the faith.” (1 Cor. 1:10; Col. 2:6, 7) Surely we are grateful for Jehovah’s spiritual provisions in these last days. Thus, “the faithful and discreet slave” does not endorse any literature, meetings, or Web sites that are not produced or organized under its oversight.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is commendable for individuals to want to use their thinking ability in support of the good news. However, no personal pursuit should detract from what Jesus Christ is accomplishing through his congregation on earth today. In the first century, the apostle Paul warned about getting involved in exhausting, timeconsuming subjects, such as “genealogies, which end up in nothing, but which furnish questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith.” (1 Tim. 1:3-7) All Christians should strive to “shun foolish questionings and genealogies and strife and fights over the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile.”—Titus 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For those who wish to do extra Bible study and research, we recommend that they explore </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures, “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,”</span><span class="font11"> and our other publications, such as those that discuss the prophecies found in the Bible books of Daniel, Isaiah, and Revelation. These provide abundant material for Bible study and meditation, whereby we can be “filled with the accurate knowledge of [God’s] will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as [we] go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.” —Col. 1:9,10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Follow the Example Set by Jesus</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we participate in the disciple-making work, we must keep in mind that our example can have a powerful effect on those who observe us. Jesus taught by word and deed. Those observing him could see his zeal, his love for people, his focused desire to sanctify his Father’s name, and his determination to accomplish his Father’s will.—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> While in the House-to-House Ministry: </span><span class="font11">As with Jesus, our example influences those who are working along with us. Newer and less experienced publishers who see us zealously engaging in the ministry will think about the quality of their share in the preaching work. When they observe our joy and genuine interest in others, they will be reminded of the importance of demonstrating such qualities in their ministry. When they notice our diligence in using the Scriptures, in making return visits, and in conducting Bible studies, they will be motivated to do the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> When Conducting Bible Studies: </span><span class="font11">Our Bible students will especially observe our conduct. For example, though we may explain to them the importance of preparing for the study, looking up the scriptures, and underlining key points, they will notice whether we are prepared. (Rom. 2:21) If we are punctual for our appointment to study with them, they will be less inclined to let other activities in-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">1. What example did Jesus set? 2. In what ways can our example affect those working with us in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3, How may our example instruct Bible students, and what may they learn? terfere with their Bible study. They will also no doubt take note of our self-sacrificing disposition for the ministry and our resolute faith. It is not surprising that students of those who closely follow the example of Jesus often become zealous, productive evangelizers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> When Attending Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font11">All those forming part of the Christian congregation have a part in teaching by example at congregation meetings. Interested ones who begin attending meetings benefit from the good example they observe in the congregation. They will notice the warm brotherhood, Christian unity, and modest dress and grooming. (Ps. 133:1) Our example of loyal attendance at congregation meetings and our public declaration of our faith while there will also be noticed. A visitor at one of our meetings observed how quickly a small girl was able to And a cited verse in her own Bible and how attentively she followed the reading. Her example moved him to request a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The Scriptures encourage us to imitate the positive example of one another. (Phil. 3:17; Heb. 13:7) Therefore, we should remember that if we closely follow the example set by Jesus, it will be observed by others and can influence them in a positive way. Realizing this, may we take to heart the words found at 1 Timothy 4:16: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4. When we attend congregation meetings, what is taught by our example?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6. Why should we never underestimate the value of our example?</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Love—The Key to a Fruitful Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> “Come to me, . . . and I will refresh you.” (Matt. 11:28) Such winsome words reflected Jesus’ deep-seated love for people. As Christian ministers, we desire to imitate Jesus in demonstrating our love for people who are worn down by a loveless world. How can we do so as we share the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Word: </span><span class="font3">Love for people moved Jesus to take advam tage of every opportunity to share the good news. (John 4:714) Love will help us to overcome hesitancy to witness informally. A six-year-old girl gave a Une witness to a woman sitting beside her in a medical waitingroom. What prompted her to do so? She explained, “The lady looked like she needed to know about Jehovah.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> We can convey our interest in people with a sincere, warm smile and a friendly tone of voice. Listening carefully to the comments of others, acknowledging their concerns, and reflecting genuine personal interest likewise demonstrate love. (Prov. 15:23) In imitation of Jesus, we should emphasize the positive Kingdom message and Jehovah's loving compassion for people.—Matt. 24:14; Luke 4:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> In Deed: </span><span class="font3">Jesus was sensitive to the needs of others in practical, tangible ways. (Matt. 15:32) We too may have opportunities to perform acts of loving-kindness while in the ministry. One sister observed a woman struggling to comprehend an important telephone call. Our sister volunteered to help by translating the caller’s words. This loving act opened the way for a Scriptural discussion that helped the woman accept a Bible study. In another case a brother making a return visit found the householder exasperated, having wedged a heavy piece of furniture in the doorway. After providing neighborly assistance, the brother was soon sitting on the couch that he had helped move, starting a Bible study with the appreciative man.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> As we share in the ministry, we demonstrate our love for God and our love for neighbor. (Matt. 22:36-40) Such demonstration in word and deed helps honesthearted ones realize that we have the truth.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I’m Not Interested”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> That is a common reaction to our message in some areas. What will help us to avoid becoming disheartened when faced with apathy in the territory? How might we be able to stimulate interest in the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Maintain Joy: </span><span class="font3">Remembering why many are apathetic will help us to maintain joy. People who were taught the theory of evolution or who were raised in an atheistic society may not have considered the value of the Bible. Others may be disillusioned by the hypocrisy they have observed in religion. For some, their apathy may mirror their frustration and hopelessness. (Eph. 2:12) Some ‘take no note’ because they are weighed down with the anxieties of life. —Matt. 24:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Regardless of the negative reaction of some, we can have joy in the ministry, knowing that our efforts glorify Jehovah. (1 Pet. 4:11) In addition, talking about the truth, even to those who do not yet appreciate it, strengthens our own faith. Let us endeavor to view people in the territory as Jehovah does. He felt sorry for the people of Nineveh who did not “know the difference between their right hand and their left.” (Jonah 4: 11) Those living in our territory need the good news! Therefore, we should not give up but should seek ways to stimulate their interest in the Bible’s message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Discuss Local Concerns: </span><span class="font3">Perhaps you could bring up a matter of local concern in your introduction and ask the householder to express his views. Listen as he speaks, then show him the Bible’s comforting message in response to his concerns. After a local tragedy, one Witness expressed his sincere regrets at each door. “Suddenly, the people started talking,” he said. “I had many fine conversations that day because I showed interest in their lives.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Each problem facing mankind will be solved by God’s Kingdom. Try to discern the one that most concerns the householder. He may allow you to explain the Bible’s message of hope. If not, he may be willing to listen “even another time.” —Acts 17:32.</span></p>

Some youths are reluctant to identify themselves as Jehovah's Witnesses because they feel their peers may ridicule them. However, there are good reasons to Identify who you are. Teachers who know your beliefs are more likely to respect them and not insist that you participate in something inappropriate. Unprincipled youths will not be so quick to invite you to share with them in misconduct. Others will more readily understand your decisions regarding matters such as dating or engaging in school sports and other extracurricular activities. You will also feel less apprehensive about witnessing in school or meeting a classmate while preaching in the territory.

When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 4, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “God's New World .Who Will Qualify to Enter?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ The video program </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask —What Will I Do With My Life?</span><span class="font13"> will be considered at a Service Meeting in April. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">■ Our Chinese literature is published in two scripts. People from Hong Kong and Taiwan generally read the traditional script, which we designate “Chinese&quot; (CH). Most other Chinese readers usually read a simplified script referred to as “Simplified Chinese” (CHS). Since the script that a person reads is unrelated to whether he speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, or another dialect, it is important to determine the script that he prefers. The booklet </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Good News for People of All Nations,</span><span class="font13"> pages 19-20, may be used for comparison. In this way, literature in the correct script will be requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Monday, April 2, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown. </span><span class="font13">Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a pioneer appointment letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. If they do not, they should inform the branch office in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: March 10, 2007 (Gilead graduation); May 11-12, 2007 (spring cleaning); September 8, 2007 (Gilead graduation); and October 6, 2007 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately submit it on the Congregation Internet Site (CIS) or on a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation Meeting Information</span><span class="font13"> (S-5) form.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Highest Quality of Medical Care—What Is It?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">“Any patient who receives bloodless medicine is, in essence, the recipient of the highest quality surgery that is possible.” So said Dr. Michael Rose, medical director and anesthesiologist. What procedures and transfusion alternatives may be included in “bloodless medicine”? You need to know in order to make informed decisions involving medical treatment and surgery. Watch the video </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">No Blood —Medicine Meets the Challenge.</span><span class="font3"> Afterward, test your understanding with the questions that follow.—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(1) What is the main reason why Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions? (2) When it comes to medical care, what do Jehovah’s Witnesses desire? (3) What basic right do patients have? (4) Why is it rational and responsible to choose transfusion alternatives? (5) When severe blood loss occurs, what two urgent priorities do doctors have? (6) What are the four principles of transfusion-alternative strategies? (7) How may doctors (a) minimize blood loss, (b) conserve red blood cells, (c) stimulate blood production, and (d) recover lost blood? (8) Describe the procedures known as (a) hemodilution and (b) cell salvage. (9) What should you want to be informed about regarding any transfusion alternative? (10) Can serious and complicated surgeries be performed without the use of blood transfusions? (11) What positive development is taking place within the medical community?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Acceptance of some of the treatments featured in the video is a matter for private decision in accord with each one’s Bible-trained conscience. </span><span class="font3">Have you decided which transfusion alternatives you are willing to accept for yourself and your children? Non-Witness family members should also be fully informed of your decisions and the reasons for them.—See “Questions From Readers&quot; in the June 15, 2004, and October 15, 2000, issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Each year, millions of people around the world, including many of our brothers and sisters, are affected by earthquakes, tsunamis, monsoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, and Hoods. Since natural disasters occur unexpectedly and could affect any of us, it is the course of wisdom to be prepared—Prov. 21:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Advance: </span><span class="font3">Sometimes the authorities are able to warn of impending disasters. It is important to pay attention to those warnings. (Prov. 22:3) In such situations the elders will try to contact all in the congregation to help them to make necessary preparations. After a disaster, the elders will also endeavor to contact all who are associated with the congregation to see if they are safe and to discern what assistance may be needed. Valuable time can be lost if the elders do not have up-to-date contact information. So it is good for publishers to keep the secretary and their book study overseer informed of their current address and telephone number(s).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> If the congregation is located in a disaster-prone area, the elders may ask publishers to provide the name and telephone number of a relative or friend who does not live in the vicinity and who should be contacted in case of an emergency. This will enable the elders to locate those who have</span></p></li></ul>

The elders may also wish to develop a contingency plan for the congregation that includes such things as a simple checklist of emergency supplies to keep on hand, evacuation arrangements, and plans for assisting those with special needs. Cooperation with these loving arrangements is important.—Heb. 13:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> After a Disaster: </span><span class="font3">What should you do if a disaster strikes in your area? Make sure that your family’s immediate physical needs are cared for. As you are able, give necessary assistance to others who have been affected. Endeavor to contact your book study overseer or another elder as soon as possible. This should be done even if you are safe and do not need help. If you need assistance, be assured that your brothers are making every effort to help you. (1 Cor. 13:4, 7) Remember that Jehovah is aware of your situation; rely on him to sustain you. (Ps. 37:39; 62:8) Be alert to opportunities to provide spiritual and emotional support to others. (2 Cor. 1:3, 4) Resume your theocratic routine as soon as possible.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> While the threat of disaster causes the world much anxiety, we can look to the future with confidence. Soon all disasters will be a thing of the past. (Rev. 21:4) In the meantime, we can take reasonable steps to prepare for times of trouble and difficulties as we maintain our zeal in declaring the good news to others.</span></p></li></ul>

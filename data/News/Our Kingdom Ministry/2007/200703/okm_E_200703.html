<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ Death to Be Commemorated on April 2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On April </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">2, 2007,</span><span class="font12"> millions of people around the world will assemble to commemorate Jesus’ sacrificial death. Jesus died as an upholder of his heavenly Father’s sovereignty, giving proof that Satan the Devil had falsely charged that humans serve God only out of selfish motives. (Job 2:1-5) The Lord’s Evening Meal also reminds us that by means of his death as a perfect, sinless human, Jesus ‘gave his soul a ransom in exchange for many.’ (Matt. 20:28) Therefore, Jesus commanded his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22: 19) Has appreciation for this precious gift of God moved you to start making preparations to commemorate this superlative act of love? —John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare Your Heart: </span><span class="font12">By considering what occurred on each of the final days of Jesus’ human life, we can prepare our heart for this Memorial observance. (Ezra 7:10) To assist us in this, a schedule of special Bible reading can be found in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures—2007</span><span class="font12"> and on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">2007 Calendar.</span><span class="font12"> This scheduled reading closely matches the days on which the events surrounding Jesus’ death occurred according to the calendar we use today. The days and dates referred to in the Bible accounts are based on the Jewish calendar, which reckons days from sundown to sundown. This difference has been taken into consideration and is reflected in the Memorial Bible reading schedule. Reviewing such information and prayerfully meditating on the depth of God’s love will help us to benefit fully from the Memorial observance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Invite Others to Attend: </span><span class="font12">The insert in the February </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> announced a special campaign to invite people to this important event. Have you made arrangements to share fully in this campaign? Have you made a list of acquaintances to invite, and have you</span></p></li></ul>

Make plans to be present early enough on the evening of the Memorial to welcome those whom you invited as well as other interested ones. You may want to sit with them, making sure that they have a Bible and a songbook. Introduce them to others in the congregation. After the program make yourself available to answer their questions. Invite them to attend the special public talk that will be given on April 15. Elders especially will be interested in making sure that those who have associated with the congregation but have become inactive receive an invitation to the Memorial and the special talk.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Help Newly Interested and Inactive Ones to Make Progress: </span><span class="font12">The Memorial speaker will briefly explain our Bible study arrangement and encourage newly interested ones to continue learning about Jehovah, You can use his comments as a basis for offering further spiritual help to those you invited. If they are not presently studying the Bible, be sure to visit them soon after the Memorial and demonstrate the free Bible study arrangement. In order to make spiritual progress, they will also need to attend congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24,25) With this in mind, encourage them to begin attending regularly. Elders will want to visit inactive Christians who attended the Memorial and to build on the thoughts presented in the discourse. This may encourage them to resume their activity in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The Memorial observance provides an opportunity to reflect seriously on what Jehovah and Jesus have done in our behalf. Such meditation deepens our love for them and affects our conduct. (2 Cor. 5:14,15; 1 John 4:11) Now is the time to begin preparing ourselves and interested ones for this important occasion during which we ‘proclaim the death of the Lord.’ —1 Cor. 11:26.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you love God’s Word but find it difficult to remember details about Bible accounts or where specific statements are recorded in the Scriptures? Would you like your children to have a firm grasp of basic Bible facts and teachings? The feature “How Would You Answer?” published each month on page 31 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> can help both young and old to become better acquainted with God’s Word.—Acts 17:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> How can you make the best use of this feature? The January 2006 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> made the following suggestions: “Take, a moment to look at page 31 . . . Some sections of the page will appeal to young readers; others will challenge the memory of more advanced Bible students. The section ‘When in History?’ will help you build a time line showing when Bible characters lived and when major events happened. While the answers to the section ‘From This Issue’ will be found throughout the magazine, the answers to most of the other questions will appear on a designated page in the same issue, where they will be printed upside down. Why not do some research before you read those answers and then share with others what you learn? You might even use this new feature, ‘How Would You Answer?’ as a basis for family or group Bible discussions.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Indeed, many families enjoy using this feature as a ba-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">2. How can the various sections of the “How Would You Answer?” feature be used?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. How have some families benefited from this feature, and which sections do you enjoy most? sis for family study. One mother writes: “My husband and I thought it would be a good idea to incorporate the ‘Children’s Picture Search’ into our family study to keep it lively and interesting for our three-year-old daughter. It is so much fun watching her excitedly take her personal copy of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and flip through each and every page until she finds what she’s looking for.” A father in Brazil says: “My seven-year-old son and I like this feature in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> very much. It has helped Moises to pay attention, to look up Scriptures, to appreciate pictures, and to understand dates.” Ashley, age eight, writes: “Thank you for the ‘How Would You Answer?’ in the back of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> I learn a lot about the Bible from it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Why not consider using “How Would You Answer?&quot; occasionally as a part of your family study? You could use the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font12"> or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font12"> on CD-ROM to look up the answers to some of the more difficult questions. By doing so, you will be teaching your children how to do research. If you have older children, why not assign them the challenge of researching the answers to “Who Am I?” or “When in History?” prior to the family study? They could then share the fruits of their research during the study. Using this page effectively is one way parents can inculcate God’s Word in their children, helping them to know “the holy writings” from infancy—2 Tim. 3:15; Deut. 6:7.</span></p>

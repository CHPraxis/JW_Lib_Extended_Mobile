<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We Cherish Our Privileges!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Throughout mankind’s existence, Jehovah has extended to his servants many types of privileges. He has given privileges to them regardless of their gender, age, or station in life. (Luke 1: 41,42; Acts 7:46; Phil. 1:29) What privileges does he extend to us today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Some of Our Privileges: </span><span class="font11">We have the privilege of being taught by Jehovah. (Matt. 13: 11, 15) Praising Jehovah by our expressions during congregation meetings is another privilege we enjoy. (Ps. 35:18) When we have opportunities to comment, we do so eagerly. Similarly, if we view each assignment in the congregation as an honor, we will fulfill it to the best of our ability. Do we regularly participate in the privilege of keeping the Kingdom Hall clean and in good repair?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Although millions wonder if their prayers are heard by God, we enjoy the privilege of having our prayers heard by the most important Personage in the universe. (Prov. 15:29) Jehovah personally listens to the prayers of his servants. (1 Pet. 3:12) He places no limit on how often we can approach him. What a cherished gift we have, to be able to pray “on every occasion’’!—Eph. 6:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> “God’s Fellow Workers”: </span><span class="font11">One of our finest privileges is that of proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom as “God’s fellow workers.” (1 Cor. 3:9) This is a work that brings satisfaction and refreshment. (John 4:34) Jehovah does not have to use humans to accomplish this work, but he has given us this assignment as an expression of his love. (Luke 19:39, 40) In doing so, Jehovah has not given this privilege to just anyone. Those who share in the public ministry must meet and maintain certain spiritual qualifications. (Isa. 52:11) Do we show that we value this privilege by making the ministry an important part of our weekly routine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Privileges from Jehovah make our life rich. (Prov. 10: 22) Never take them for granted! By demonstrating that we truly cherish our privileges of service, we please our heavenly Father, the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present.” —Jas. 1:17.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Worshipping Jehovah as a Family</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In Bible times, family members did many things together. They performed daily chores and primarily worshipped Jehovah as a family. (Lev. 10:12-14; Deut. 31:12) Today, in many places, family members do very little together. However, Christians rec ognize the value of engaging in activities as a family, especially when it comes to worship. How it must please the Originator of the family to see families worshipping him in unity!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preach Together: </span><span class="font11">Working together to preach the good news strengthens the family bond. Therefore, in addition to accompanying others in the congregation to preach, an elder will also regularly work with his wife and children. (1 Tim. 3:4, 5) Despite having a full schedule, even traveling overseers arrange time to work with their wives in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Parents who preach with their children are able to help them progress as evangelizers. Not only will children observe their parents’ joy and satisfaction in the ministry but they will see their parents express their own love for Jehovah and for fellow humans. (Deut. 6:5-7) The importance of this does not diminish as children in the home grow older. One couple with three sons between the ages of 15 and 21 continue to accompany them in the ministry on a regular basis. The father said: “We teach them something every time. And we make sure that it is an enjoyable, encouraging experience.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Prepare Together: </span><span class="font11">Families have found it beneficial to prepare for the ministry together. Children often enjoy practice sessions with members of the family taking turns giving the presentation or being the householder. Some use a few minutes at the end of the family study to do this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> Our joy is increased when we engage in important and satisfying activities with those we love. How epjoyable it is for family members to work together in the field ministry from house to house as well as in making return visits and conducting Bible studies! As you thus worship Jehovah with your family, you can joyfully declare: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.’’—Josh. 24:15.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Turn Magazine Placements Into Bible Studies</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On Saturdays we generally feature the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines in the ministry. However, this is only the first step in reaching our goal of teaching honestheart-ed ones the truth. Below are some suggestions on how to place the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book on a return visit and start a Bible study. These may be adapted to your territory and put in your own words. Feel free to use another approach if it is effective for you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Use the Introductory Pages: </span><span class="font12">When you return, you could say: “The magazines I left you direct attention to the Bible. Notice why Bible reading is so important.” Read Isaiah 48:17, 18; John 17:3; or another appropriate scripture. Then after introducing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book and handing the householder a copy, you could proceed as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “The Bible gives us a real hope for the future.” Show the householder pages 4-5 and ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Direct him to the chapter that discusses the Scriptural promise he selected, and briefly consider a paragraph or two if he allows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Or you could say, “The Bible answers the most important questions of life.” Direct his attention to page 6, and ask if he has ever wondered about any of the questions at the bottom of the page. Turn to the chapter that gives the answer, and briefly discuss a paragraph or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Or you could point out some of the titles in the table of contents and ask which one of the subjects interests him. Turn to that chapter, and briefly demonstrate a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Leave a Question on the Initial Visit: </span><span class="font12">Another option is to lay the groundwork for the return visit on the initial call. After the householder accepts the magazines, raise a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">1. What is our goal when placing magazines? 2. How could we use the Introductory pages in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book to start a Bible study?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">3. How might we start a Bible study after placing magazines that deal with (a) worsening world conditions? (b) the family? (c) the reliability of the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">question, and promise to answer it on your next visit. Endeavor to make a definite arrangement to return, and be sure to keep the appointment. (Matt. 5:37) When you go back, remind the householder of the question, and briefly read and discuss the answer from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book. Hand him a copy so that he can follow along. Here are a few examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ If the magazine you placed deals with worsening world conditions, you could say, </span><span class="font12">“Next time we can discuss the Bible’s answer to this question, What changes will God bring about on the earth?” Use pages 4-5 when you return. Or you could raise the question, “Are tragedies God’s will?” On the return visit, show the householder paragraphs 7-8 in chapter 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ If the magazine you placed deals with the family, before leaving you might raise this question,</span><span class="font12"> “What can each member of the family do to make family life happier?&quot; When you return consider paragraph 4 in chapter 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ If the magazine you placed deals with the reliability of the Bible, you could raise this question for your next discussion,</span><span class="font12"> “Is the Bible scientifically accurate?” On the return visit, consider paragraph 8 in chapter 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> At the end of each discussion, raise another question to be answered on the next visit. Once a regular study is established, consider the book systematically from beginning to end. What if the householder does not accept the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book? You can still continue to take him the magazines and have Scriptural discussions with him. As you cultivate his interest, he may in time accept a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> may stir up a person’s desire to learn what the Bible really teaches. Therefore, make a special effort to start Bible studies with those who accept the magazines. In this way, we will obey Jesus’ instructions to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.”—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">4. What should we do if the householder does not accept the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. Why should we endeavor to do more than leave magazines with people?</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Worthy Goal for the New Service Year</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> We must set goals if we want to make spiritual progress. What personal goals have you set for the new service year? An excellent goal is auxiliary pioneering for one or more months. Since this enjoyable activity usually requires some advance planning, now is a good time to begin thinking ahead. Why consider auxiliary pioneering as a goal?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Reasons to Auxiliary Pioneer; </span><span class="font1">Auxiliary pioneering enables us to please our heavenly Father “more fully” by spending increased time in the ministry. (1 Thess. 4:1) As we consider all that Jehovah has done for us, our hearts move us to tell others about him. (Ps. 34:1, 2) Jehovah takes note of and appreciates the personal sacrifices we make in order to do more in the ministry. (Heb. 6:10) Knowing that we are pleasing Jehovah by our hard work brings us great joy.—1 Chron. 29:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Usually, the more you do something, the easier and more enjoyable it becomes. Spending increased time in the ministry will make you more comfortable speaking at the door. You will become more proficient at starting conversations and in using the Bible. The more you discuss your faith, the stronger it will</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What goal might we consider for the new service year?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Why consider auxiliary pioneering as a goal?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3, 4. How do we benefit from auxiliary pioneering?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">become. Many who were not conducting a Bible study have been able to start one while auxiliary pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Auxiliary pioneering may also be the boost needed to get out of a spiritual rut. A former regular pioneer who felt he was putting too much emphasis on secular work decided to auxiliary pioneer for one month. He said: “I could not believe how that one month energized me spiritually! I made arrangements to auxiliary pioneer continuously, which led to my becoming a regular pioneer once again.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Overcome Obstacles: </span><span class="font1">Some may hesitate to apply because they feel they lack ability as preachers. If this is causing you to hold back, Jehovah can help you as he did Jeremiah. (Jer. 1:6-10) Although Moses was “slow of mouth and slow of tongue,” Jehovah used him to accomplish His will. (Ex. 4:10-12) If you feel inadequate, petition Jehovah for courage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Do you hesitate to apply because of health problems or a busy schedule? If you are infirm, pacing yourself may make auxiliary pioneering possible. If you have a busy schedule, you may find that you can move some nonessential activities to another month. Some with a full-time</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">5. How may we be able to overcome feelings of inadequacy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">6. How may it be possible to auxiliary pioneer despite health problems or a busy schedule?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">job have been able to buy out time to auxiliary pioneer by taking one or two days of vacation.—Col. 4:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> How to Do It: </span><span class="font1">Make your desire a matter of prayer. Ask Jehovah to bless your efforts to expand your ministry. (Rom. 12:11, 12) He can help you make wise decisions regarding how to adjust your schedule. (Jas. 1:5) If you lack the desire, ask Jehovah to help you find pleasure in the preaching work.—Luke 10:1,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> Discuss as a family the goal of auxiliary pioneering. (Prov. 15:22) Perhaps one member of the family could auxiliary pioneer with the support of others in the household. Discuss with others in the congregation your desire to pioneer, especially with those who have similar circumstances. This may generate increased enthusiasm to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> As you review your theocratic calendar for the new service year, when might you be able to auxiliary pioneer? If you work full-time or go to school, you may want to consider months that have a holiday or that have five Saturdays or five Sundays. For example, September, December, March, and August have five full weekends. The month of May has five Saturdays, and June has five Sundays. If you have health problems, consider months that usually have good weather. You may</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">7. Why is it beneficial to make auxiliary pioneering a matter of prayer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">8. How might applying Proverbs 15:22 enable you to auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">9. Which months might you choose to auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">also consider pioneering during the month the circuit overseer is scheduled to serve your congregation. During his visit, you will have the added privilege of attending the first half of the meeting that is held with the regular pioneers. Since the Memorial falls on March 22 next year, March, April, and May are excellent choices. Once you have chosen the month or months that you want to auxiliary pioneer, begin writing out a schedule that will enable you to meet the hour requirement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> Even if you feel that you are unable to auxiliary pioneer during this coming service year, you can still maintain the pioneer spirit. Continue to do all that you can in the ministry, confident that Jehovah is pleased with your whole-souled effort to give him your best. (Gal. 6:4) Be supportive, and encourage those who are able to auxiliary pioneer. Perhaps you can adjust your schedule to share in the ministry an additional day of the week with those who are pioneering.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> Jehovah’s people have a sense of urgency. There is a job to get done —the preaching of the good news. Lives are involved, and the time left is reduced. (1 Cor. 7:29-31) Love for God and for neighbor will move us to do all that we can in the ministry. With effort and good planning, we may be able to auxiliary pioneer at least one month during the new service year—a worthy goal indeed!</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>New Circuit Assembly Program</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah deserves to be glorified. How do we glorify Jehovah? What challenges are some facing in this regard? What blessings come to those who glorify God now? The circuit assembly program for the 2008 service year will provide satisfying answers to these questions. It has as its theme “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) Consider what is in store for us during the upcoming two days of rich spiritual instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The district overseer will speak on the subjects “Why Give God Glory?” and “Be Exemplary in Meeting God’s Requirements.” He will give the public discourse, “Who Are the People Who Glorify God?,” and the closing talk, “Unitedly Glorifying God Worldwide.” He will also conduct the Theocratic Ministry School. The circuit overseer will speak on the themes “Take Delight in Reflecting God’s Glory,” “Giving Attention to the Needs of the Circuit,” and “Remain ‘Firmly Set in the Truth,”’ which is based on 2 Peter 1:12. In addition, we will learn how “The Pioneer Ministry Glorifies God.” “Glorifying God in All Aspects of Our Life,” the first of two thought-provoking symposiums, will explore the depth of meaning in the inspired words found at 1 Corinthians 10:31. The symposium “Rendering Sacred Service to Praise Jehovah” will deal with various facets of our worship. We will enjoy the summary of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and the discussion of the daily text on Sunday. There will also be an opportunity for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The majority of mankind refuse to acknowledge God. Many are too distracted by human schemes to ponder the magnificence of Jehovah. (John 5:44) But we are convinced of the value of spending time considering how to “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” Plan to be on hand and to benefit fully from all four sessions.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>New Special Assembly Day Program</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The theme of the special assembly day program for the 2008 service year is “We Are the Clay—Jehovah Is Our Potter,” based on Isaiah 64:8. The Scriptural admonition provided by means of this program will increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s wisdom, justice, power, and love as the Great Potter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The circuit overseer’s talk, “Serving as Honorable Vessels in the Ministry,” will show how increasing numbers are enjoying the rich blessing of knowing the truth and sharing it with others. The talk “Meditation Will Safeguard You” will reveal how serious contemplation of Jehovah’s righteous principles protects us. The visiting speaker will address the audience on the themes “Not ‘Fashioned After This System of Things’ ” and “Be Molded by the Great Potter.” Parents and young ones will find encouragement in the parts “Youths Who Are Useful to Jehovah” and “Vital Role of Parents in the Molding Process,” Through demonstrations and interviews, we will delight to hear and observe what our brothers and sisters are accomplishing in their ministry. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication to God by water baptism should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. Be sure to bring your copy of the issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> to be studied the week of the special assembly day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Whatever the Great Potter purposes he accomplishes. But it is up to each one of us to choose how we will respond to his shaping of us. Those who wisely submit to Jehovah’s patterns and refinements can, as a lump of clay on a potter’s wheel, be fashioned, polished, and transformed into useful vessels. When we cooperate with Jehovah, we magnify his sovereignty and receive many blessings.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each of our five weekly meetings is different in its format and purpose. Yet, all of them are important in helping us to “consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) What are some unique and beneficial features of the Congregation Book Study arrangement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Help to Progress Spiritually: </span><span class="font11">The number of people attending a book study is generally far less than the number attending the other congregation meetings. This makes it easier to develop friendships that are a source of spiritual support. (Prov. 18:24) Have you made an effort to get to know everyone in your book study group, perhaps asking each one to work with you in the ministry? The book study arrangement also enables the book study overseer to know the unique circumstances of each one in the group and to provide personal encouragement.—Prov. 27:23,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Have you invited your Bible students to attend the book study with you? Interested ones who are reluctant to attend our larger meetings may be less nervous about attending a smaller meeting, especially in a private home. The intimate atmosphere makes it easier for young ones and those newly associated to share in commenting. And since the group is smaller, we have more opportunities to participate and praise Jehovah.—Ps. 111:1.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">1. How do our five weekly meetings help us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. What benefits come from meeting with a smaller group at the book study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How does the book study arrangement promote commenting as well as attendance by Bible students?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Book studies are generally held at convenient locations throughout the territory. While it is not possible for all to be assigned to the location nearest them, attending our assigned book study may require less travel than attending other congregation meetings. The book study location may also serve as a convenient meeting place for field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Help for the Ministry: </span><span class="font11">The book study overseer is interested in assisting each one to have a regular, meaningful, and joyful share in the ministry. Therefore, he endeavors to work with everyone in the group, giving personal assistance in various features of the ministry. If you find a particular aspect of the ministry to be challenging, such as making return visits, let your book study overseer know. Perhaps he can arrange for you to work with an experienced publisher in the group. Your ability to teach on Bible studies will be refined by paying careful attention to the book study overseer’s good teaching methods as he conducts the book study. - 1 Cor. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> What a blessing the Congregation Book Study Is! This loving arrangement from Jehovah helps us maintain our sure spiritual footing during the challenging times in which we live.—Ps. 26:12.</span></p></li></ul>

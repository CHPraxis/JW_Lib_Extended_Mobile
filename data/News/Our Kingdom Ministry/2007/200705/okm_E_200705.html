<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“He Is Giving to the Tired One Power”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> All of us get tired from time to time. It may result not only from work or other physical activity but also from the challenges we face in these “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) As servants of Jehovah, how do we acquire the spiritual strength needed to keep from slowing down in our ministry? We do this by relying upon the one who Is “vigorous in power,&quot; Jehovah. (Isa. 40:26) He is aware of our needs and has a genuine interest in helping us. —1 Pet. 5:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s Provisions: </span><span class="font9">Jehovah strengthens us by means of his holy spirit, the same irresistible force that he used to create the universe. God’s spirit helps us to “regain power” if we become weary. (Isa. 40: 31) Ask yourself, ‘When was the last time I specifically prayed for holy spirit to strengthen me to meet my Christian obligations?’ —Luke 11:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> By daily reading and meditating on God’s inspired Word and being nourished spiritually by a regular study of our Christian publications, we will be like avibrant “tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither.”—Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah also uses fellow believers, who can be “a strengthening aid” to us. (Col. 4:10, 11) They strengthen us at congregation meetings by their upbuilding conversation, comments, and talks. (Acts 15:32) Christian elders, especially, provide spiritual help and refreshing encouragement—Isa. 32:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> The Ministry: </span><span class="font9">If you feel yourself becoming weary, do not stop preaching! Unlike many other activities, regular participation in the ministry actually refreshes us. (Matt. 11:28-30) Sharing the good news helps us to focus on God’s Kingdom and to keep eternity and its blessed prospects in view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> There is much to do before this wicked system is destroyed. We have every reason to remain steadfast in our service, “dependent on the strength that God supplies.” (1 Pet. 4:11) With Jehovah’s help we will finish our work, for “he is giving to the tired one power.”—Isa. 40:29.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Champion God’s Word?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In a world that often discredits the Bible, true Christians zealously advocate God’s Word. Convinced that “all Scripture is inspired of God,” we stand with Jesus Christ, who testified in prayer to Jehovah: “Your word is truth.” (2 Tim. 3:16; John 17:17) How may we effectively champion God’s Word?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Learn Scriptures: </span><span class="font9">Jesus no doubt applied himself to learning God’s Word. This enabled him to teach from the Scriptures throughout his ministry. (Luke 4:16-21; 24:44-46) How can we build up in our memory a helpful reservoir of scriptures? We do so by reading the Bible each day and then meditating on a verse that we found to be especially encouraging or helpful for the ministry. When preparing for meetings, we should look up and read the cited scriptures directly from the Bible and perhaps prepare a comment on them. When attending meetings, we should follow along in our Bible as the speaker reads scriptures. Learning Bible texts will prepare us to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’ —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Let the Bible Speak: </span><span class="font9">While engaging in the ministry, we should let the Bible speak. For example, if circumstances allow, we should try to share a scripture with the householder. If he asks a question or raises an objection, it is best to use the Bible to give an answer. When the householder is busy, we may still be able to highlight a Biblical thought by saying, “Before I go, allow me to leave you with this one scripture.” Whenever possible, read directly from the Bible, allowing the listener to follow along as you read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When one householder was shown scriptures to refute the Trinity, he exclaimed, “I have attended church all my life, and I surely didn’t know the Bible says this!” He readily accepted a Bible study. Jesus said that his sheep would listen to his voice. (John 10:16, 27) The best way for honesthearted ones to recognize the truth is to see it directly from the Scriptures. Let us therefore be champions of God’s Word of truth!</span></p>

In disaster-prone areas, additional emergency contact information should be obtained. Of course, in addition to emergency situations, it is helpful when publishers communicate with their Congregation Book Study overseer or another elder if they will be away for extended periods, such as when traveling on vacation or business, during a hospital stay, and so forth. ■ Individuals confined to prisons, jails, substance-abuse facilities, or state hospitals should receive literature and spiritual assistance under the direction of the congregation assigned by the branch office as the contact for the facility. Publishers should not contact the branch office to request literature or visits for such individuals. Rather, those confined should initiate requests for visits or literature through publishers approved to visit their facility or by writing directly to the branch office. This allows the individual to give evidence of his genuine interest and may assist publishers in being granted access to the facility.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">■ How should the opening song of the Theocratic Ministry School, the Service Meeting, the Public Meeting, and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study be introduced, and by whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Opening song selections for each week of the Theocratic Ministry School are listed in the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule that constitutes the October </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> insert. Opening and closing songs for each week’s Service Meeting are indicated on page 2 of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> Likewise, song numbers for the weekly </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study are found on page 2 of each issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> The songs assigned are considered part of the unified whole of the meeting and should thus be introduced by the brother conducting the meeting rather than by the chairman of the preceding meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For example, the Theocratic Ministry School overseer will welcome the audience, introduce the opening song, conduct the school, and then invite the first speaker of the Service Meeting to the platform. The brother with the Service Meeting part is the one who should call for the song that opens the Service Meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In like manner, the Public Meeting will be called to order by a chairman. He will warmly welcome all in attendance and invite them to join in singing the opening song selected by the speaker. The chairman (or perhaps another qualified brother assigned in advance) will open the meeting with prayer. He will introduce the speaker and state the subject of his discourse. After the talk the chairman, while not summarizing what the speaker just said, will make a brief expression of appreciation for the instruction. He will announce the title of the public talk for the following week, and then he will invite all in attendance to remain for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">Study. There is no need for the chairman to ask if the audience would like to send love and greetings to a visiting speaker’s congregation. Next, the chairman will invite the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study conductor to the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study conductor will introduce the first song to be used in conjunction with the study. He will conduct the study in harmony with published instructions and then announce the concluding song. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study conductor will usually call on the brother who gave the public talk to offer the closing prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Observing these general guidelines will help to ensure that our congregation meetings are conducted in a unified manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach Your Children to Praise Jehovah</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Psalm 148:12, 13 encourages boys and girls to “praise the name of Jehovah.&quot; The Scriptures contain numerous examples of young children who did so. For example, “Samuel was ministering before Jehovah, as a boy.” (1 Sam. 2:18) It was “a little girl” who told Naaman’s wife that Jehovah’s prophet in Israel could cure Naaman of his leprosy. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font9"> Ki. 5:1-3) When Jesus entered into the temple and performed powerful works, “boys” were the ones who cried out: “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” (Matt. 21:15) How can . parents teach their children to praise Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Example: </span><span class="font9">Before inculcating the truth in their children’s hearts, Israelite fathers were instructed first to love Jehovah and have his commands on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">their </span><span class="font9">own hearts. (Deut. 6:5-9) If you speak positively about the ministry and make it a part of your weekly schedule, your children will be Inclined to view the ministry as important and satisfying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> One sister fondly recalls: “When I was growing up, our family routine included sharing in the field ministry every weekend. I could see that my parents really enjoyed preaching. We grew up viewing the ministry as something pleasurable.” This sister became an unbaptized publisher at the age of seven and is in her 33rd year of fulltime service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Can young children praise Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Why is it important for parents to set a good example for their children?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How was one sister benefited by her parents’ example?</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Progressive Training: </span><span class="font9">Involve your children as you share in the ministry. Perhaps they can ring the doorbell, hand the householder a tract, or read a scripture. This will add to their enjoyment and help them to gain confidence in their ability to share the Kingdom message. As they grow older, their participation in the ministry should increase. Therefore, help them to be progressive and to give thought to spiritual goals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Speak to the elders as soon as you feel that your children are qualified to become unbaptized publishers and when they express a desire to become such. Becoming a publisher will impress upon them their personal responsibility to praise Jehovah. Keep in mind that a child does not need to know as much as baptized adults before he can qualify. Does your child understand basic Bible teachings? Does he adhere to the Bible’s moral standards? Does he desire to share in the ministry and to be identified as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? If so, the elders may then determine that he is qualified as an unbaptized publisher.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will,</span><span class="font9"> pp. 79-82,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Teaching children to praise Jehovah from their heart requires work. However, few things cause greater joy for parents than seeing their children make spiritual progress. More important, Jehovah is pleased when children tell about his wonderful works.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">For United States of America </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">km-E</span><span class="font4"> Us 12/07 Vol. 50, No. 12</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We Must Maintain Our Zeal for the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Each year since 1992, Jehovah’s Witnesses have zealously devoted more than one billion hours to the worldwide Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. How happy we are to have had a small share in such a marvelous accomplishment!—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Of course, all thanks and praise belong to Jehovah, who has sustained us in our ministry during these “critical times.” (2 Tim. 3:1) What is required on our part if we are to continue having a zealous share in this important work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Basis for Zeal: </span><span class="font14">Deep love for God and neighbor, as well as a heartfelt desire to live up to our dedication, motivates us in our Kingdom service. (Matt. 22:37-39; 1 John 5:3) Love moves us to make sacrifices so that we can have a full share in the preaching work. —Luke 9:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Work to Maintain Zeal: </span><span class="font14">Our adversary the Devil makes every effort to dampen our zeal for the ministry. The apathy of those in our territory, the distractions of this world, the pressures of daily living, and concern over our own diminishing health are just a few of the things that he uses in an attempt to discourage us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Therefore, we must work hard to keep our zeal alive. It is important for us to cultivate “the love [we] had at first.” That involves regularly reading and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible, and availing ourselves of all the spiritual provisions of “the faithful and discreet slave.” -Rev. 2:4; Matt. 24:45; Ps. 119:97.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> As Bible prophecies clearly indicate, Jehovah’s day for the destruction of ungodly men is fast approaching. (2 Pet. 2:3; 3:10) With that clearly in mind, let us work hard at maintaining our zeal for the ministry, having a full share in the worldwide Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work now under way!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Make It Your Goal to Conduct a Bible Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (John 4:35) Those words spoken by Jesus Christ are certainly applicable to the situation Christian ministers face today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Honesthearted people desirous of being taught the ways of Jehovah are still being found. This is evident in the number of new disciples being baptized each year. If you are genuinely interested in conducting a Bible study, what might you do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Set a Goal: </span><span class="font14">First, set a goal to start and conduct a regular Bible study. Keep your goal in mind while engaging in the field ministry. Since our Christian commission involves teaching, along with preaching, all of us should seek to have an increased share in the Bible study work. —Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Other Points to Keep in Mind: </span><span class="font14">Heartfelt prayer is a must for Kingdom publishers. At times we find people who have prayed for spiritual assistance. What a blessing it is to be used by Jehovah to And and teach such ones! —Hag. 2:7; Acts 10:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> A sister prayed for a Bible study and then displayed copies of the tract </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font14"> at her place of work. When a woman picked up one of the tracts, read it through, and began to fill out the coupon, the sister spoke to her and was able to start a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>0</sup> Fellow publishers who are effective in starting and conducting Bible studies can help you to reach your goal to conduct a Bible study. Prayerfully look for one, and take advantage of all the assistance available to reach this goal. Perhaps soon you will experience the joy of conducting a Bible study.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul urged Hebrew Christians to gather together and to encourage one another “all the more so” as they beheld the day drawing near. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Evidence is mounting that “the day” Paul spoke of is very near at hand! Therefore, we look forward to opportunities to assemble with our brothers and sisters for spiritual instruction that can guide us through these increasingly perilous “last days.” (2 Tim. 3:1) Such an opportunity will be provided at the upcoming 2008 district conventions.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Friday and Saturday 9:20 a.m. - 4:55 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sunday 9:20 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Attend All Three Days: </span><span class="font0">We encourage you to be in attendance for all three days. By “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together,” we will not miss out on vital spiritual food. (Heb. 10:25) Begin making preparations as soon as possible. You will want to inform your employer early so that he can make any necessary arrangements. If your children will be in school during the time of your convention, inform their teachers of your plans. Let them know that the convention is a regular part of your worship. You can be sure of Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts to put Kingdom interests first.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Help Others Attend: </span><span class="font0">Paul also ap-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. (a) Why does Paul’s counsel to the Hebrew Christians apply with special urgency today? (Read Hebrews 10:24, 25.) (b) What upcoming opportunity will we have to apply Paul’s counsel?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. (a) Why is it vital to attend all three days of the convention? (b) How should we begin making preparations to attend?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">pealed to his brothers to “consider one another.” (Heb. 10:24) Do brothers and sisters in your Congregation Book Study need assistance to attend the convention? Can you help your Bible students to enjoy the convention with you, even if they can be present for only one day? When you inform unbelieving family members of your convention plans, invite them to come with you. Your loving efforts may bring unexpected blessings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Obtaining Information: </span><span class="font0">The branch office receives hundreds of telephone calls each year asking when and where the conventions will be held. Nearly all of these calls are from brothers and sisters who have already received this information. Before calling the branch office, we suggest that you first consult the March 1, 2008, issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> If you will be attending a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned, you may obtain rooming information by writing to the convention headquarters address located on the back of the current </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Needs Room Request</span><span class="font0"> form. These forms will soon be sent to congregation secretaries. To receive a reply, be sure to include a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your letter.</span></p></li>

Before the congregation secretary sends the form to the convention Rooming Department, the guidelines found on the form and in the December 14, 2007, letter addressed to all bodies of elders should be consulted.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Reserving a Room: </span><span class="font0">A Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on the information board at the conclusion of your Service Meeting for the week starting January 7. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Before </span><span class="font0">making a hotel reservation, review the “Rooming Guidelines” and the “Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation.” Rather than accepting a higher rate at a hotel on the list or calling a hotel that is not on the list, please wait for the congregation to receive a revised list for your convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Fine Works: </span><span class="font0">Obedience to Jehovah’s command to gather together for worship enables us to ‘benefit ourselves.’ More important, it provides opportunities to glorify Jehovah’s name. (Isa. 48:17) Our “fine works are publicly manifest” to many persons at district conventions, and some have been moved to express their feelings. (1 Tim. 5:25) In one city where our conventions have been held for many years, a hotel manager acknowledged: “A lot of talk goes on in the city about Jehovah’s Witnesses and what your conventions mean to us. We know how your people clean the civic center, and</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">7. How may we cooperate with the arrangements that have been made for rooming? (See the box “Rooming Guidelines.”)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">8. (a) In what ways may we glorify Jehovah as we attend our convention? (b) Because of the fine conduct of our brothers, what comments have been made by hotel personnel?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Guidelines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Do not call for hotel reservations prior to your Service Meeting the week of January 7, 2008.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ If at all possible, make your hotel reservations during the month of January. Do not make your hotel reservation online, since we are not using that method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Stay only in hotels on the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Do not accept a higher rate than what is shown on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Each room reserved should be in the name of the person who will actually occupy it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">■ To comply with fire regulations, do not exceed the number of adults allowed in the hotel room, as shown on the list.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">■ Keep your first reservation.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ Do not call hotels that are not on the list to ask if they have a rate for our convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ If no rooms are available after you have called ALL the hotels on the list or if you have a problem with a particular hotel, inform your congregation secretary. He should communicate with the convention Rooming Department using the contact information at the top of the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ If you must cancel a reservation, do so as early as possible. Be sure to receive a cancellation number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. Call hotels during regular business hours using the phone numbers on the list to get the discounted rate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. Inform the hotel that you are attending the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. Specify the dates you will check in and check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">4. If no rooms are available, call another hotel on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">5. Make your reservation, and ask for a confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">6. Make your deposit by credit card, check, or money order within ten days. Never send cash. If a deposit is made by check or money order, write the confirmation number on the front. </span><span class="font0">we see you cleaning up the parking lots. It is a pleasure having your people with us during our summer season. We hope we can continue our relationship in the years to come.” After relating the difficulties encountered with other groups and entertainers, a hotel manager commented on the cooperative spirit and patience shown by our brothers during their hotel stay. He said, “We wish all our guests were like Jehovah’s Witnesses!” The conduct of our brothers that led to these and many similar comments must bring joy to the heart of our God, Jehovah!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> Jesus said that our very lives depend on listening to “every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) At our annual conventions, Jehovah provides spiritual “food at the proper time,” prepared by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45) Much work has gone into preparing and serving this spiritual banquet. May we demonstrate our gratitude for Jehovah’s loving care by being present and paying close attention to each part on the program.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Greatest Preaching Campaign the World Has Ever Known!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">For over 100 years, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been organized to share the good news. (1 Cor. 9:23) In what has become the greatest preaching campaign the world has ever known, we speak this message in hundreds of languages. We deliver it in more than 230 lands. (Matt. 24:14) But why is this work necessary? And how is it being accomplished on a global scale?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The video </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Organized to Share the Good News</span><span class="font0"> answers those questions by providing a closeup look at the many facets of our international activities. As you watch it, consider these questions: (1) How is our activity organized and directed? (2) How do the Writing, Translation Services, Art, and Audio/Video Services Departments contribute to communicating the good news? (3) What is the purpose of our extensive printing and shipping operations? (John 17:3) (4) How many pieces of literature are printed in one year? (5) What have our Biblebased publications accomplished? (Heb. 4:12) (6) What is being done to provide spiritual assistance for those who are visually or hearing impaired? (7) How is our work financed? (8) How do we benefit from the work of Hospital Information Services, the Service Department, and the Convention Department? (9) As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, how has this video enhanced your appreciation for (a) the effort that Jehovah’s organization is making to preach the good news? (b) the more than 100 Bethel families around the world? (c) the educational training provided for overseers and missionaries? (d) the importance of starting each day considering a Bible text and preparing each week for congregation meetings? (e) the benefits of attending our Christian gatherings? (f) what Paradise on earth will mean? (Isa. 11:9) (g) sharing personally in the ongoing harvest work?—John 4:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What positive reaction have you seen when showing this video to your relatives, acquaintances, return visits, and Bible students? Why not share it and the good news with someone else very soon? —Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Offer the Magazines That Bear Witness to the Truth</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom</span><span class="font14"> and its companion magazine, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font14"> remain at the forefront of the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) We take delight in regularly presenting these two timely journals as we participate in various aspects of Kingdom service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Over the years we have seen changes in the size and content of the magazines as well as in the methods we use to distribute them. These changes have been made with the objective of making the magazines more appealing and effective, so that the Kingdom message reaches the heart of ‘all sorts of men that they might be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.’ —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Since January 2006, we have become adept at using various presentations for the one monthly issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> Now we will take a similar approach to offering just one of the two monthly issues of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom</span><span class="font14"> in our public ministry. Sample presentations for each magazine appear on the back page of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font14"> These usually highlight one of the opening articles in the magazine, but at times certain other articles with wide appeal are featured. The published suggestions can be used most effectively when we are well acquainted with the featured article and use our own words to adapt the presentation to our territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Although </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> includes two suggestions for each magazine, feel free to use an entirely different presentation. One reason for doing so could be that one of the other articles would have wider appeal in your territory. Or it may be that you feel that you could make a more effective presentation by using an article that holds greater interest for you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How to Prepare Your Presentation: </span><span class="font14">First of all, you must be thoroughly familiar with the article you choose to feature. You may not always be able to become familiar with every article in</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What is the role of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font14"> What changes have been seen in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font14"> and why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. How will the magazines be used in the ministry? 4. Why may it be beneficial to use other presentations aside from the suggested presentations in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font14"> Before preparing a presentation for the featured magazine, what must you do? the magazine before you begin using it in the field ministry. However, you must reflect enthusiasm and sincerity with regard to the articles you choose to feature. You can do that only when you are well acquainted with the information you present.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Next, be flexible, or versatile, in preparing your opening words. A pointed interest-arousing question related to the article may be used to begin a conversation. Always rely on the power of God’s Word to touch the heart. (Heb. 4:12) Select an appropriate scripture that relates to the subject you introduce, preferably a text that is cited or quoted in the article that you are featuring. Consider how to tie in the scripture with the article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> At Every Opportunity: </span><span class="font14">For a presentation to be truly effective, it must be put to use. Share with the congregation in magazine witnessing on Saturday, Offer the magazines to people who have previously accepted other literature. Always offer the magazines to your Bible students and to other people who may be present when you make a return visit. You may be able to place magazines with people you talk with when you go shopping, while traveling, or while waiting at a doctor’s office. Refine your presentations as you use them throughout the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> magazines are unique. They exalt Jehovah as the Sovereign of the universe. (Acts 4:24) They comfort people with the good news of God’s Kingdom and encourage faith in Jesus Christ. (Matt. 24:14; Acts 10:43) In addition, they keep watch on world events as these fulfill Bible prophecy. (Matt. 25: 13) Help individuals in your territory to benefit from these journals by preparing to offer them at every appropriate opportunity!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> When you succeed in placing a magazine, or even if you just have friendly spiritual conversation with someone, be prepared with a question or a thought-provoking statement that may open the way for a return visit and another spiritual conversation. If we are zealous in sowing seeds of truth, we can be sure that Jehovah will open the hearts of those who sincerely desire to know and serve Him.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Comfort the Brokenhearted</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> At no other time in mankind’s history has there been such a need to provide comfort. Following the lead of our King, Christ Jesus, we also work to “bind up the brokenhearted.”—Isa. 61:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Approach: </span><span class="font14">To comfort people, our ministry should be characterized by a well-balanced, positive presentation. When we keep discussions about the world’s bad deeds and false doctrines to a minimum, Scriptural truth and the bright hope of God’s comforting promises are foremost in the conversation. This does not mean that Armageddon should not be discussed. Our commission is to proclaim both “the year of goodwill on the part of Jehovah and the day of vengeance on the part of our God,” and to “warn the wicked one from his wicked way.&quot; However, the warning of Armageddon and a description of its destructive results is not meant to overshadow the theme of the good news of God’s Kingdom.—Isa. 61:2; Ezek. 3:18; Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> From Door-to-Door: </span><span class="font14">It is not uncommon to find people who are downhearted because of sickness, the death of a loved one, injustices, or economic problems. As imitators of Christ, we are “moved with pity” and show a sympathetic attitude toward those whom we meet in the ministry. (Luke 7:13; Rom. 12:15) Although we share a scripture or two related to the problem, we must prove to be “swift about hearing,” thus allowing the person to express his feelings. (Jas. 1: 19) After first listening, we are in a better position to provide comfort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> At an appropriate time in the conversation, we might say, “I would like to share with you some encouraging words from the Bible.” Good judgment should be used so as not to endeavor to refute every wrong view that the person may express. Rather, our focus should be to provide encouragement and comfort by using the Scriptures to fortify the heart. In this regard, you may consult </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font14"> pages 117-121 under the heading “Encouragement.” Or you may furnish the householder with a copy of the tract </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed</span><span class="font14"> and review the encouraging material therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Look for Opportunities to Comfort Others: </span><span class="font14">Do you know of a neighbor, workmate, schoolmate, or family member that is in need of comfort? Why not make an effort to visit such ones at their home with the goal of sharing comfort from the Scriptures? Knowing why they need comfort, you can prepare for that particular situation. In this regard some have written letters or made telephone calls. True love of neighbor will move us to show fellow feeling and to provide needed comfort from the Scriptures.—Luke 10:25-37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Yes, we are commissioned to comfort those who mourn, to lift saddened hearts, and to instill hope for a bright future. This is the comfort that people around the world need. Talking joyfully about the many good things God has promised will bring comfort and hope to the honesthearted. May we always remember the need to bind up the brokenhearted.</span></p></li></ul>

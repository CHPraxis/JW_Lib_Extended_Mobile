<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We Are Glad to Expend Ourselves in Jehovah’s Service!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was glad to “be completely spent” for the sake of fulfilling his Christian ministry. (2 Cor. 12:15) Similarly today, many Christians work diligently as pioneers. Others with heavy family responsibilities make room in their busy schedule to share in the ministry each week. Some with serious health problems use their limited energy to promote Kingdom interests. How encouraging it is to see Jehovah's people, regardless of age or circumstances, expend themselves in Jehovah’s service!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Love of Neighbor: </span><span class="font10">Doing all we can to serve Jehovah, demonstrating love for God and for neighbor, gives us a clean conscience. Because Paul imparted his soul in sharing the good news, he could happily say: “I call you to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood of all men.” (Acts 20:24, 26; 1 Thess. 2:8) Sharing in the ministry to the extent our circumstances allow will prevent us from becoming bloodguilty. -- Ezek. 3:18-21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">'<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark2">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark3">2</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark4">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Working hard to help others brings us happiness. (Acts 20:35) One brother said: “When evening comes, and I return home after a day in Jehovah’s service, I feel tired, it is true. But I am happy, and I thank Jehovah for having given me a joy that no one can take away.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Love of God: </span><span class="font10">The most important reason for expending ourselves in Jehovah’s service is that it pleases our heavenly Father. Love of God moves us to observe his commands, which include preaching and making disciples. (1 John 5:3) Even when people are apathetic or opposed, we joyfully continue to work hard for Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Now is no time to let up. We are living during the harvest. (Matt. 9:37) A farmer usually works long hours during a harvest because he has limited time to gather the crops before they begin to spoil. The time allowed for the spiritual harvest work also is limited. Keeping in mind the time that we are living in, may we all continue to exert ourselves vigorously in the ministry.—Luke 13:24; 1 Cor. 7:29-31.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep On “Bearing Much Fruit”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">we manifest the fruitage of the spirit. Do you work at cultivating the fruitage of God’s spirit by regularly studying and meditating on God’s Word? (Phil. 1: 9-11) Do not hesitate to pray for holy spirit, which can produce qualities that glorify Jehovah and that promote continued spiritual progress.—Luke 11:13; John 13:35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Cultivating the fruitage of the spirit will also help us to be more zealous ministers. For example, love and faith move us to make room in our busy schedule to share regularly in the ministry. Qualities such as peace, long-suffering, kindness, mildness, and self-control help us to react properly to opposers. Joy enables us to find satisfaction in the ministry even when people are unresponsive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Kingdom Fruitage: </span><span class="font10">We also want to bear Kingdom fruitage. That includes offering “a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to [Jehovah’s] name.” (Heb. 13:15) We do this by zealously and steadfastly proclaiming the good news. Are you endeavoring to bear more Kingdom fruitage by improving your personal ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jesus indicated that his faithful followers would bear different amounts of fruit. (Matt. 13:23) Therefore, we should not compare ourselves with others but give to Jehovah our best. (Gal. 6:4) An honest self-examination of our personal circumstances in the light of God’s Word will help us to continue glorifying Jehovah by “bearing much fruit.”—John 15:8.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When “a large door that leads to activity” was opened to the apostle Paul, he eagerly took advantage of the opportunity to promote Kingdom interests despite many opposers. (1 Cor. 16:9) Today some 642,-000 Kingdom publishers around the world have entered a large door of activity by becoming regular pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Circumstances Change: </span><span class="font10">Although present personal circumstances may limit our activity, circumstances change. Therefore, it is good for us to evaluate our own situation from time to time and not wait for the ideal circumstances. (Eccl. 11:4) Are you a youth about to graduate from high school? Are you a parent whose children will soon begin attending school? Are you nearing retirement from your secular employment? Such changes may free up time and thus allow you to enter the regular pioneer service. A sister who had previously experienced health difficulties decided to enroll as a pioneer at the age of 89. Why? Since she had not been in the hospital in over a year, she felt that her health would allow her to pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In Paul’s case, he originally intended to visit his brothers in Corinth. Yet, he adjusted his plans for the sake of the good news. Many who are regular pioneering today had to make a number of adjustments in order to pioneer. Some have simplified their life to the point where part-time employment is</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What “large door that leads to activity” is open to us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Why is it good to evaluate our situation from time to time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How have some made adjustments so as to regular pioneer? all that is needed to care for their reduced living expenses. They have found delight in their privilege of service. (1 Tim. 6: 6-8) Some married couples have made changes that allow them to get by on just one income, thus opening the way for the wife to pioneer.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Do not be quick to dismiss the idea of pioneering for fear that you cannot meet the hour requirement. Just a little over two hours a day is needed. If you are unsure that you can do it, try auxiliary pioneering for a month or two but with a personal goal of 70 hours. This will allow you to taste the joys of pioneering. (Ps. 34:8) Talk to those who are currently pioneering. They may have overcome challenges similar to yours. (Prov. 15: 22) Ask Jehovah to bless your efforts to expand your ministry. —1 John 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> A Worthwhile Pursuit: </span><span class="font10">Serving as a regular pioneer brings many blessings. It allows you to experience the greater happiness that comes with increased giving. (Acts 20:35) Pioneering will sharpen your ability to handle God’s Word of truth aright. (2 Tim. 2:15) It will provide increased opportunities to see Jehovah’s hand at work in your behalf. (Acts 11:21; Phil. 4:11-13) Pioneering will also help you to develop spiritual qualities, such as endurance, and will enable you to draw closer to Jehovah. (Jas. 4:8) Can you enter this large door of activity and become a regular pioneer?</span></p></li></ul>

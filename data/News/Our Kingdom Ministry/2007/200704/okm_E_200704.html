<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">April 2007 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 4/07 Vol. 50, No. 4</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Speak the Word of God Fearlessly”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Do you sometimes hesitate to speak up about your faith when afforded an opportunity at school or at work? Is it a challenge for you to witness informally to relatives and neighbors or perhaps to people you do not know? What will help all of us to take advantage of appropriate occasions to “speak the word of God fearlessly”?—Phil. 1:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Do Not Hold Back: </span><span class="font3">Would you hold back from defending a close friend or a relative who was being falsely accused? Jehovah, our closest Friend, has been grossly misrepresented throughout the centuries. We have the unique privilege of giving a witness in behalf of our great God! (Isa. 43:10-12) Deep love for Jehovah can help us deal with feelings of self-consciousness or fear and can move us to speak up, not holding back from boldly bearing witness to the truth.—Acts 4:26, 29, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Remember that our message is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">good news.</span><span class="font3"> It will bring lasting benefits to those who heed it. Focusing on the value of the preaching work instead of on ourselves or on our opposers will help us to preach with boldness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Examples of Others: </span><span class="font3">We can draw strength from the faithful course of others who have spoken the word of God fearlessly. For example, Enoch courageously proclaimed Jehovah’s judgment against ungodly sinners. (Jude 14, 15) Noah faithfully preached to people who were apathetic. (Matt. 24:37-39) First-century Christians who were “unlettered and ordinary” continued to preach despite harsh opposition. (Acts 4:13.18-20) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> often contain modernday life stories of those who by exercising faith in Jehovah overcame fear of man and became zealous evangellzers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> We can take courage by considering the life course of faithful servants of old who faced difficult situations. (1 Ki. 19:2,3; Mark 14:66-71) They “mustered up boldness by means of our God” and spoke fearlessly. So can we!—1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">All Can Have a Share in Making New Disciples</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> A new disciple does not result from the efforts of just one person. Jehovah can use all his “fellow workers” to help Bible students grow spiritually. (1 Cor. 3:6-9) We individually help new ones not only by our heartfelt comments at Christian meetings but also by our good conduct, which gives striking evidence of God’s spirit at work in our lives. (John 13: 35; Gal. 5:22, 23; Eph. 4:22, 23) What more can be done to help new ones?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> As a Congregation: </span><span class="font3">All of us can demonstrate interest in those who begin to attend meetings by taking the initiative to greet them warmly and to converse with them before and after the meeting. Reflecting on his first contact with the congregation, one man said: “I met more genuinely loving people, total strangers, in one day than I had ever met in the church in which I was raised. It was apparent that I had found the truth.” He was baptized seven months after attending his first meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Give sincere commendation as a Bible student makes spiritual progress. Has he been enduring opposition? Is he attending meetings regularly? Did he muster up the courage to comment? Has he enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School or started sharing in the ministry? Commend him for the progress he has made. This will refresh and reassure him,—Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> As a Bible Study Conductor: </span><span class="font3">Some publishers have been able to help their Bible students get acquainted with individual members of the congregation by asking other publishers to accompany them on the study. Invite the student to congregation meetings as soon as possible. When he begins attending meetings, make a point of introducing him to others. Is he struggling to overcome a bad habit, such as smoking? Does someone in his household object to his studying? He may benefit by talking to a publisher who has faced and overcome a similar challenge.*—4 Pet. 5:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> New ones need spiritual support from the congregation. All can assist them in making progress by demonstrating sincere personal interest.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span><span class="font2">A Service Meeting will be scheduled in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font2"> for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Follow the Christ!” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of points from the convention that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry. The review should be handled by the service Overseer. Invite the audience to comment on how they are applying or plan to apply that information in their ministry.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Concerted Global Effort to Advertise the “Follow the Christ!” District Convention </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers Will Again Distribute a Special Handbill</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Last year the worldwide campaign to advertise the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention had a powerful effect on interested ones. Those who accepted the special invitation and came experienced for the first time what a sumptuous spiritual feast among Jehovah’s Witnesses is like. (Isa. 65:13) They enjoyed association with our warm, united Christian brotherhood. (Ps. 133:1) In order to help as many as possible to attend the “Follow the Christ!” District Convention, we will once again engage in distributing worldwide a special handbill.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Results Last Year: </span><span class="font3">Based on reports that were received from all parts of the world, excellent results were achieved by advertising the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Convention. In many places we received favorable publicity. For example, in one city, a newspaper published a six-column article about the campaign, stating: “To reach everyone in time Witnesses have been making an extra push in the neighborhood—working longer hours, walking longer distances, and talking faster.” The coordinated handbill distribution aroused the interest of the local media in another city, prompting in-depth news coverage. At least three newspapers favorably reported on our activity before the convention. A reporter wrote several extensive articles that covered more than two pages in the Sunday edition of one newspaper. It detailed our beliefs, our brotherhood, the handbill distribution, and the convention. When one publisher presented the invitation at a door, the householder interrupted, saying: “Yes. I was just reading about that in the paper!” Another householder exclaimed: “I’ve just been reading about you, and now you’re here! Is that my invitation?” She then added, “This is a very nice thing for Jehovah’s Witnesses to be doing.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Many interested individuals were seen approaching the convention sites with their invitation in hand. Some interested ones drove from distant cities in order to attend sessions. Our diligent efforts to invite others contributed to an increase in attendance, with one country having 27 percent more people present for the convention than the previous year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Territory Coverage: </span><span class="font3">You may begin distributing the handbill three weeks before the start of your convention. Every effort should be made to cover the entire congregation territory. In congregations that have a large amount of territory, publishers may leave the handbill discreetly at not-at-homes during the final week before the convention. Congregations should endeavor to distribute the entire allotment of handbills and to cover as much territory as possible. Any surplus can be utilized by the pioneers in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> What to Say: </span><span class="font3">You might say something like this: “We are sharing in a global effort to distribute this invitation to an important upcoming event. This is your copy. You will find other details set out in the invitation.” Keeping the presentation brief will allow for a wide distribution. Of course, if the householder has questions, take the time to answer them. Where interest is shown, make a record and call back on the individual as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> How vital it is that we strive to follow the Christ! (John 3:36) Our upcoming district convention will help all who attend to do just that. Surely we can anticipate that a tremendous witness will again be given as a result of this concerted effort to advertise the “Follow the Christ!” District Convention. Therefore, be zealous in inviting as many as possible to attend. May Jehovah’s rich blessing be upon your personal efforts as you share in this united global campaign.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Follow the Christ by Manifesting Dignity</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The Bible describes the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah, as being clothed with dignity. (Ps. 104:1) Jesus always spoke and acted in a way that honored his Father and his Father’s provisions. (John 17:4) Each of us will have opportunities to imitate Jesus and bring glory to Jehovah during our upcoming “Follow the Christ!” District Conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Dignified Worship: </span><span class="font3">We can honor Jehovah by arranging to be present for the spiritual feast that he has prepared for us. Have you spoken with your employer and arranged your affairs to attend each day of the convention, including Friday? Have you planned to arrive in sufficient time to locate seating and share in the opening song and prayer? Have you planned your noon meals so that you can eat at the convention site with your brothers? At the beginning of each session when the chairman kindly invites us to take our seats before the music starts, we should quickly end our conversations and be seated for the beginning of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Paying close attention to the program also honors our heavenly Father. After observing a local district convention, a reporter wrote that onlookers would be impressed by “the exemplary behavior of those present, as they follow what is being said in respectful silence and with evident spiritual affinity.” He also commented on “the exceptional number of children..., all strangely well behaved or even busy consulting verses in the Holy Bible.” While the program is in session, it is not the time for needless talking, text messaging, eating, or roaming the corridors. Youths should be seated with their parents so that parents can help them to benefit from the program. (Deut. 31:12; Prov. 29:15) Such efforts show respect for others and appreciation for the vital spiritual food being served.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. How does this year’s convention theme relate to manifesting dignity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. How does our preparation for being present at each session honor Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. How does paying close attention to the program dignify our worship?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Dignified Appearance: </span><span class="font3">Many expressed appreciation for the reminders in last year’s district convention talk “Manifest Christian Dignity at All Times,” which emphasized that God’s servants should strive to manifest Christian dignity in their dress and grooming. This year we should again give this matter our serious attention. Our appearance reflects our feelings for Jehovah and for the privilege of being his Witnesses. We should always dress as those “professing to reverence God.”—1 Tim. 2:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Should we manifest a dignified appearance only when attending the program? Remember that many will observe us wearing our convention badges while in the convention city. Our appearance should make us stand out from the general public. Therefore, even during leisure time, such as when going out to eat after the program, we should dress as befits ministers who are in the city for the purpose of attending a Christian convention and should not wear such clothing as jeans, shorts, or T-shirts. What a witness this will give to the community! Jehovah is pleased when our appearance bespeaks our role as ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Satisfying Results: </span><span class="font3">Manifesting Christian dignity at our conventions creates opportunities to witness informally and leaves observers with a favorable impression. At the end of one convention, an official remarked: “We have never seen such well-behaved people. You are the way God expects us to be.” Manifesting dignity shows respect and love for one another and glorifies Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:12) It demonstrates our godly fear and our appreciation for the privilege of being instructed by our Father. (Heb. 12:28) May we strive to manifest dignity as we anticipate this year’s “Follow the Christ!” District Convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Why should we have a dignified appearance while at the convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. How can we maintain a dignified appearance during leisure time in the convention city?</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font3">The program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small FM receiver along with earphones.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Fragrances; </span><span class="font3">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas where we depend on mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be a kindness for us to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions to those who suffer from respiratory or related problems.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Follow-Up Forms: </span><span class="font3">A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font3"> (S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any who show interest as a result of our informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. The forms will also be available at the convention Book Room Department. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room for handling or to your congregation secretary upon your return.—See the February 2005 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font3"> p. 6.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hotels: </span><span class="font3">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) As Christians, surely we will not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. (8) The room rate shown on the Recommended Lodging List is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are billed for any additional charges for anything you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible. (9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, be sure to inform the Rooming Department while at the convention.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Children are sometimes asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” When you were a small boy, would you have said that you wanted to be a cowboy? a fireman? a circuit overseer? Or as a little girl, would you have said that you wanted to be a ballerina? a nurse? a missionary? Now that you are older, you must ask yourself another question, ‘What will I do with my life?’ Are you ready to decide?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To help you make the best possible decision, Jehovah’s organization produced the DVD </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask—What Will I Do With My Life?</span><span class="font3"> Please watch it, and give serious thought to all that it contains, including the drama, interviews, and supplementary material. The contents are outlined in the box “Main Menu.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Drama: </span><span class="font3">As you watch the drama, consider these questions: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font3">What similarities are there between Timothy, who is spoken of in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and Andre? (Acts 16:1; 1 Tim. 4:8; 2 Tim. 1:5) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font3">How was Andre being pressured to excel in athletics, and by whom? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) </span><span class="font3">Who proved to be positive influences on Timothy and on Andre, and in what ways? (2 Tim. 1:1-4; 3:14, 15) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font3">How did the admonition at Matthew 6:24 and Philippians 3:8 affect Andre, and how does it affect you?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Selected Scenes: </span><span class="font3">After watching the entire drama, replay the following scenes, and answer these questions. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Paul and Timothy”:</span><span class="font3"> What was Paul’s final admonition to Timothy? (2 Tim. 4:5) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Giving Jehovah Your Best”:</span><span class="font3"> What sort of spiritual goals do you have? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Taking a Stand for Jehovah”: </span><span class="font3">From where does real happiness come? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Grandmother’s Advice”:</span><span class="font3"> What is wrong with wanting to be a star in Satan’s world?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Interviews: </span><span class="font3">As you watch each of the following sections, what do you see that you can do to give your best to Jehovah? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font3">“Dedication to Vain Pursuits or to God?” (1 John 2:1.7); </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font3">“Learning to Enjoy Your Ministry” (Ps. 27:14); and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) </span><span class="font3">“An Open Door to Service.” —Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Looking Back: </span><span class="font3">Can you answer? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font3">What careers were the brother and the sister pursuing, and why? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font3">How successful had they become? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) </span><span class="font3">What was the turning point in each one’s life? (2 Cor. 5:15) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font3">What theocratic careers replaced their former ones, and why did they feel that they could not pursue both? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) </span><span class="font3">Do they have any regrets for having changed their focus in life? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font3">What did they say that has especially made you think about what you should do with your life?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Supplementary Interviews: </span><span class="font3">In these interviews, what have you learned that you can do to apply yourself more fully in Jehovah’s service? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font3">“The Value of Personal Study,” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font3">“Alternative Witnessing,” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) </span><span class="font3">“Bethel Service, ” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font3">“Gilead Missionary Training,” and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) </span><span class="font3">“Ministerial Training School.” Review the “Index to Published Information on Related Subjects,” and read more about what interests you most.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> So have you decided what you will do with your life? Paul urged Timothy: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:15) We urge you to do the same with what you have seen and heard on this DVD. Ask Jehovah to help you make a wise choice that will truly give you joy and fulfillment in life now as well as a rewarding and happy future.</span></p></li></ul>

When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J une: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?</span><span class="font14"> As an alternative offer, you may use </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> July: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on the Watch!</span><span class="font14"> Where genuine interest is shown, offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book, making a diligent effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2007 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request them. If the congregation needs additional badge cards, these should be requested on the Congregation Internet Site (CIS) or on a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Request Form</span><span class="font14"> (S-14). Plastic badge card holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Regular Pioneer Service</span><span class="font14"> (S-205) and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service</span><span class="font14"> (S-205b). These may be requested on the Congregation Internet Site (CIS) or on a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Request Form</span><span class="font14"> (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Before sending regular pioneer application forms to the branch office, make sure they are completely filled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Presiding Overseer/Secrelary Change of Address</span><span class="font14"> (S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men under the age of 26 who are (1) citizens and have reached 18 years of age or (2) noncitizens who move to the United States must register within 30 days. From the time a man registers until he turns 26, he must notify Selective Service within ten days of any change of address. Compliance with this law is a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders should remind those to whom this applies or will soon apply of their duty to register.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>When People Are Not at Home</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> In many areas it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people at home. In these “critical times,” many are forced to work long hours just to make ends meet. (2 Tim. 3:1) Some may be away from home spending money or engaging in recreation. How can we reach such ones with the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Keep Good Records: </span><span class="font3">The first step is to make note of those who are not at home. This is especially important if you work your territory frequently. Do you make note of the name of the street, the territory number, your name, and the date? You may leave room for making additional notes when you or another publisher returns to work the not-at-homes. At the end of the witnessing period, remember to give the record or notes to the person who has the territory, unless he agrees for you to work the not-at-homes. Use a separate sheet to record any interest found that you will care for.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Try at a Different Time: </span><span class="font3">Perhaps some who were not at home during the workday may be home in the evening or on weekends. Could you arrange your schedule to go back at a more opportune time? (1 Cor. 10:24) If not, you may be able to give the not-at-homes to a publisher who can go back at a different time. Otherwise, you might write to those who were not at home or try to reach them by telephone. Publishers</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. What is a common challenge when engaging in the door-to-door ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. How can we make sure that not-at-homes will be cared for?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. What are some suggestions for reaching those who are not at home? </span><span class="font3">whose health problems limit their share in the door-to-door work may be happy to assist you with this.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> One case illustrates the importance of trying to contact those who are not at home. After publishers repeatedly called at one home for three years, the householder was eventually contacted. It turned out that she had been waiting all that time for a Witness to come by in order to resume the Bible study that she had before moving to that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Complete the Territory: </span><span class="font3">When is a territory considered completed? Generally, this is when reasonable efforts have been made to contact someone at each home. It may be appropriate to leave a tract or an older magazine discreetly at the not-at-homes, especially in territories that are worked infrequently. The territory should be completed within four months. Then it should be checked in so that the territory servant can update his records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> We want as many people as possible to have an opportunity to learn to call on the name of Jehovah and be saved. (Rom. 10:13, 14) This includes those who happen to be away from their home when we call from house to house. Like the apostle Paul, make it your desire “to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”—Acts 20:24.</span></p>

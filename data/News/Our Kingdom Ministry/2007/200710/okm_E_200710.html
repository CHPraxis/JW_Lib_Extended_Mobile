<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! to</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Offered During November!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">J Many people have sincere questions about the value of the Bible. If men wrote it, how can it be called God’s Word? What reasons are there for trusting it to direct my steps? If I read and study the Bible, how will my time and effort be rewarded? Which Bible translation should I use? These are some of the questions that are answered in the November special issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> entitled “Can You Trust the Bible?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> We will want to give this special issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> wide distribution in our territory. If possible, share in the house-to-house ministry with the congregation each Saturday during the month of November. Show this issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> to your relatives, neighbors, workmates, teachers, schoolmates, and return visits. Carry copies with you when shopping and traveling. The elders have requested extra copies so that the congregation will have a sufficient supply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Start a Bible Study: </span><span class="font0">If you place the magazine, you can lay the groundwork for a Bible study before concluding your conversation. For example, you might say, “Next time, I would like to show you the Bible’s answer to this question, ‘What is God’s purpose for the earth?’” Then return with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book and show the householder pages 4-5, or consider paragraphs 1-3 of chapter 3. Another option is to say, “Next time, I would like to discuss a Bible prophecy that is being fulfilled right now.” When you return, show the householder chapter 9 of the book and consider together paragraphs 1-3. Or you might simply tell the householder: “Many find it difficult to understand what they read in the Bible. Next time, I would like to show you how you can understand your Bible better.” On the return visit, introduce the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font0"> book, and demonstrate a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Only the Bible contains “holy writings,” which are able to make us “wise for salvation.” (2 Tim. 3:15) Therefore, all of us will want to have a zealous share in distributing this special issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> to help people develop trust in the Bible!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Hope to the Poor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Jesus took a special interest in those who were impoverished. There were occasions when he miraculously provided material assistance and healed the sick, but his focus was on declaring “good news” to the poor. (Matt. 11:5) The Christian ministry today continues to benefit the poor as well as others. —Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Real Hope; </span><span class="font0">Christendom's ministers often promise the poor that they will prosper if they give generously to the church. However, the Bible teaches that only God’s Kingdom will end poverty and solve all of mankind’s problems. (Ps. 9:18; 145:16; Isa. 65:21-23) By showing the poor what the Bible really teaches, we impart hope and help them to satisfy their spiritual need.—Matt. 5:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> The Pharisees of Jesus’ day looked down on the poor, contemptuously calling them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">‘am-ha-’a'rets,</span><span class="font0"> or “people of the land.” However, Jesus viewed “their blood,” or their life, as “precious.” (Ps. 72:13,14) We can imitate Jesus and ‘show favor’ to such poor ones by being kind and sympathetic. (Prov. 14:31) Never would we want to speak disparagingly about people living in poor neighborhoods or show a reluctance to witness to them. Many who are responding to the Kingdom message are of humble means.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Help Now: </span><span class="font0">Our teaching Bible principles to poor ones in the territory also helps them to mitigate the effects of poverty right now. For example, the Bible condemns drunkenness, gambling, laziness, the use of tobacco, and other practices that contribute to poverty. (Prov. 6:10, 11; 23:21; 2 Cor. 7:1; Eph. 5:5) The Scriptures encourage honesty and working “whole-souled,” qualities looked for in employees. (Col. 3:22, 23; Heb. 13:18) In fact, in one survey the majority of employers ranked honesty and Integrity as qualities that impress them most in job candidates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah is not insensitive to the sufferings of the poor. Soon Jesus Christ will deliver “the poor one crying for help.” (Ps. 72:12) Until then, we have the privilege of comforting others, including the poor, with the Bible’s message of hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote to the congregation in Rome: “I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you in order for you to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” (Rom. 1:11, 12) Modern-day visits of traveling overseers provide similar opportunities for an interchange of encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Congregation: </span><span class="font0">The circuit overseer’s visit is generally announced to the congregation about three months In advance. This allows time for us to adjust our schedule so as to benefit to the full. (Eph. 5:15, 16) If you work secularly, perhaps you will be able to request time off to support field service during the week. Some arrange to auxiliary pioneer during the month of the visit. If you have planned to be away, could you make adjustments in order to be present that week?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> A primary purpose of the circuit overseer’s visit is to give personal encouragement and training in the field ministry. Could you ask to work with him or with his wife if he is married? The circuit overseer enjoys working with various publishers, including those who may have less experience or lack a measure of skill in the ministry. All can learn from his presentation and apply any suggestions</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">3. What may we personally do during the visit to obtain encouragement? that he may kindly offer. (1 Cor. 4:16, 17) Inviting him to share a meal with you will open further opportunity for encouraging fellowship. (Heb. 13:2) Since his talks are tailored to the needs of the congregation, listen carefully.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> The Circuit Overseer: </span><span class="font0">The apostle Paul was no different from the brothers he served in that he experienced challenges and anxieties and he appreciated encouragement. (2 Cor. 11:26-28) When the congregation in Rome learned that Paul, now a prisoner, was finally coming there, some traveled to the Marketplace of Appius to meet him—a distance of 46 miles! “Upon catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.” (Acts 28:15) You can likewise encourage your circuit overseer. Show him “double honor” by your enthusiastic support of his visit. (1 Tim. 5:17) Express and demonstrate your sincere appreciation for his efforts in your behalf. He and his wife will rejoice as they observe your faith, love, and endurance. —2 Thess. 1:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> In these “critical times hard to deal with,” who among us does not need encouragement? (2 Tim. 3:1) Decide now to share fully in the special week of activity with the circuit overseer. All of us—traveling overseers and publishers alike—can participate in a joyful interchange of encouragement. In this way we will also “keep comforting one another and building one another up.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p>

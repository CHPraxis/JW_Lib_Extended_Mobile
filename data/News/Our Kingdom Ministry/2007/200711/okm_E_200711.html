<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Walk as Wise Persons</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus asked four fishermen to be his followers, they did not put their decision off but “at once . .. they followed him.” (Matt. 4:18-22) When Saul of Tarsus was converted and then regained his sight, he likewise did not procrastinate but “immediately in the synagogues he began to preach Jesus.” (Acts 9: 20) Time constantly moves forward; once it passes, it is gone forever. That is why it is impor-. tant for us to ‘walk as wise persons’ with regard to how we use our time.—Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Unforeseen Occurrence: </span><span class="font12">Opportunities we have today to serve Jehovah may be gone tomorrow. (Jas. 4:14) No one is exempt from “unforeseen occurrence.” (Eccl. 9:11) Additionally, we are all getting older, and the “calamitous days” that accompany advancing age and that limit what we are able to do in Jehovah’s service are inescapable in this present system of things. (Eccl. 12:1) Therefore, it is not wise to put off making a dedication to God or to wait for ideal circumstances before expanding our ministry to the extent presently possible. (Luke 9:59-62) Abraham found peace and serenity in his later years, dying “old and satisfied” because he had used his life wisely, entirely devoted to Jehovah.—Gen. 25:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Time Is Reduced: </span><span class="font12">We also want to spend our time wisely because “the time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29-31) Very soon now this old system of things will end. Opportunities to participate in the great ingathering of sheeplike ones during the “harvest of the earth” will end. (Rev. 14:15) We must be careful not to allow life’s anxieties and distractions to rob us of time that would be better spent in the ministry. (Luke 21: 34, 35) How satisfying it will be to look back knowing that we had a full share in the harvest!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We must be watchful constantly so as not to miss out on joyous privileges of service that might come our way. Let us be determined to do all that we can to serve Jehovah “as long as it may be called ‘Today.’” (Heb. 3: 13) By doing so, we will show ourselves to be truly wise, because “he that does the will of God remains forever.”—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We Share Our Kingdom Hope</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During these critical last days, many in the world are without hope. (Eph. 2:12) Others have unwisely put their confidence in material riches, human rulers, modern science, and so forth. How happy we are to have a real hope for the future, a hope that is “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm”! —Heb. 6:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Under God’s Kingdom rule, the earth will be transformed into a paradise. Dead loved ones will be resurrected. (Acts 24:15) Poverty, injustice, sickness, old age, and death will be no more. (Ps. 9:18; Matt. 12:20, 21; Rev. 21: 3,4) These are some of Jehovah’s promises soon to be fulfilled. Which aspect of our hope do you especially look forward to?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Declare Good News: </span><span class="font12">We must not keep the Kingdom hope to ourselves. Love for God and neighbor moves us to imitate Jesus and “to declare good news to the poor, ... to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release.” (Luke 4:18) The apostle Paul shared the good news in the marketplace and wherever people were found. He occupied himself intensely with the ministry. (Acts 18:5) Following his example of sharing zealously in the ministry will prevent “the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches” from dimming our Christian hope. —Mark 4:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Our Kingdom hope does not fade when we meet people who show indifference, who lightly esteem the Kingdom message, or who outwardly oppose us. We “hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering.” (Heb. 10:23) We are not “ashamed of the good news.” (Rom. 1:16) It may be that our evident conviction and perseverance will eventually move some to listen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Though we properly call attention to deteriorating world conditions that fulfill Bible prophecy, we are not preachers of doom. Rather, our ministry is focused on our Kingdom hope —the good news of God’s Kingdom. May we preach this good news with conviction and zeal “so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end.” —Heb. 6:11.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">■ Is it appropriate to affix our personal e-mail address to literature that we distribute?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By means of a stamp or a printed label, some publishers have affixed their personal e-mail address to the magazines or tracts that they place with others. Those who accept the literature are then able to contact the publisher to request additional information. Such efforts to help interested ones are well-intentioned. However, our official Web site is already indicated on the back of the magazines and tracts. Therefore, it is best if we do not affix a personal e-mail address to the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Whether a publisher provides people in the territory with contact information on a separate piece of paper, especially when making return visits, is a personal decision. We should take the initiative to call back on those who are interested instead of just leaving it up to them to contact us for more information. Genuine personal interest can be more readily manifested when speaking with the person face to face.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> By actively participating in proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom, we do not “hold back good” from those in our assigned territories. (Prov. 3:27) There is no better message to be shared with mankind than that of the better times to come under God’s rule. Although you may generously share the Kingdom hope by witnessing informally or placing literature, why not make it your goal to conduct a Bible study, if you are not yet doing so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> At times, one of the biggest obstacles to conducting a Bible study is the way we feel about the matter. Some hold back from conducting a Bible study because of feeling inadequate or because of their hectic schedule. The following suggestions may be helpful to you in not holding back from having a share in the Bible study work. —Matt. 28:19; Acts 20:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Lack of Confidence: </span><span class="font12">Perhaps you have limited secular education or for some other reason lack confidence in your ability to conduct a Bible study. Effective Christian ministers in the first century were “unlettered and ordinary.” What enabled them to teach others the truth? “They used to be with Jesus.” (Acts 4:13) They learned from the Great Teacher, Jesus, whose teachings and methods have been preserved for us in the Scriptures. Even if your secular education is limited, you are receiving spiritual education that is unsurpassed.—Isa. 50:4; 2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. In what way do we “not hold back good&quot;?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. What may hold us back from starting a Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. Why are we qualified to teach the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">‘‘Jehovah sometimes used prophets to reprove erring rulers or others in high station. Some, such as Amos, had a humble background. Amos admitted: “I was not a prophet, neither was I the son of a prophet; but I was a herdsman and a nipper of figs of sycamore trees.” (Amos 7:14) Nevertheless, Amos did not hold back from delivering Jehovah’s judgment message to the calfworshipping priest Amaziah. (Amos 7:16, 17) We must always remember that we are performing God’s work and he will adequately qualify us for the work at hand.—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Busy Schedule: </span><span class="font12">Even if you have a busy schedule, you have likely already set aside time to share in the ministry regularly. Conducting a Bible study can be one of the most enjoyable aspects of the ministry. It is a privilege to see Jehovah’s Word at work in a person’s life. (Heb. 4:12) Jehovah is pleased when we make personal sacrifices in order to assist someone to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) Even the angels experience joy when someone repents of his former course and makes spiritual progress.—Luke 15:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> God’s “will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) What a privileged role we have to work in harmony with God’s will, not holding back from conducting Bible studies!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">4. What can we learn from the example of Amos?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. Why should we endeavor to start a Bible study even if we have a busy schedule?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">6. What privilege do we have in carrying out God’s will?</span></p></li></ul>

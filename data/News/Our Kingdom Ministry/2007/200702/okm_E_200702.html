<div>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Entrusted With a Treasure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul valued his God-given commission to preach and referred to it as a “treasure.” (2 Cor. 4:7) He endured hardships and persecution in carrying out that commission. He tirelessly preached to anyone who happened to be on hand. He traveled many difficult and dangerous miles by land and by sea. How can we imitate Paul and show that we cherish our ministry? (Rom. 11: 13) What makes our ministry an incomparable treasure?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Superior Treasure: </span><span class="font4">Earthly treasures are often accompanied by much heartache and yield only limited or temporary benefits. On the other hand, our ministry brings lasting benefits to us and to others. (1 Tim. 4:16) It helps sincere people come to know Jehovah, make needed changes in their lives, and gain a real hope of everlasting life. (Rom. 10:13-15) By highly esteeming our ministry, we acquire a satisfying purpose in life, a lasting sense of accomplishment, and an uplifting hope for the future.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Demonstrate That You Value Your Treasure: </span><span class="font4">The value we place on something is often demonstrated by what we are willing to spend for it. What a privilege it is to spend our time and energy praising Jehovah! (Eph. 5:16, 17) The way we spend our time should show that we place more value on spiritual things than on material pursuits. Since we have something so precious to share, we will want to preach with enthusiasm and to be alert to tell the good news at every opportunity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Priceless treasures are usually not hidden but are exhibited for others to enjoy. If we view our ministry as a treasure, it will be a prominent part of our life. (Matt. 5:14-16) With hearts full of appreciation, may we always imitate the apostle Paul and take advantage of every opportunity to show that we truly value our ministry, esteeming it as a treasure.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Christ in Your Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jesus set the example for us to follow in our ministry. His deep love for God and for people was demonstrated on many occasions and in many ways. He taught meek ones the truth and performed acts of loving-kindness in behalf of those who were afflicted and downtrodden. —Matt. 9:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Jesus’ Example and Teachings: </span><span class="font4">Jesus did not become sidetracked by involving himself in political affairs or mere humanitarian efforts to better the community. Nor did he allow any other well-intentioned pursuits to distract him or overshadow his primary work. (Luke 8:1) He focused on the preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom as the only permanent solution to mankind’s problems. Jesus had a great work to do and limited time in which to do it. When people in Capernaum wanted Jesus to remain there, he said to his disciples: “Let us go somewhere else... that I may preach there also, for it is for this purpose I have gone out.” —Mark 1:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> After giving his disciples training, Jesus sent them out with these specific instructions: “Preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ * (Matt. 10:7) He taught his followers that Kingdom interests should take priority in their lives. (Matt. 6:33) Jesus’ parting words to his disciples before he ascended to heaven made clear what they were to do. He said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” —Matt. 28:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Importance of the Kingdom: </span><span class="font4">Jesus’ main topic of discussion was God's Kingdom, and he urged his disciples to follow his example. Human efforts to solve mankind’s problems cannot be successful. (Jer. 10:23) Only God’s Kingdom will sanctify God’s name and provide permanent relief for mankind. (Matt. 6:9, 10) Teaching Kingdom truths to people who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done” helps them to live a happy, successful life now and hold fast to a reliable hope for the future.—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Jesus continues to be involved in the preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom, and he assures us of his support. (Matt. 28:20) To what extent does our ministry measure up to the model that Jesus set for us? (1 Pet. 2:21) In these momentous last days, may we do everything within our power to adhere closely to the example Jesus set in the ministry!</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the excellency and the dignity; for everything in the heavens and in the earth is yours.” (1 Chron. 29: 11) How does our love and appreciation for Jehovah affect us? It moves us to ‘declare abroad the excellencies of the one that called us out of darkness into his wonderful light.’ (1 Pet. 2:9) We cannot stop telling others about our great God! We will have outstanding opportunities to proclaim Jehovah’s excellencies during the months of March, April, and May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Special Campaign to Advertise the Memorial: </span><span class="font5">On Monday, April 2, we will highlight Jehovah’s excellencies by observing the Lord’s Evening Meal. A special invitation to this important event will be distributed earth wide from March 17 to April 2. All are encouraged to have a full share. This would be an excellent time for new ones to begin publishing the good news if they qualify. If you have Bible students or children who may qualify, take the initiative to speak with the elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> This campaign will be similar to what was done in connection with the “Deliverance at Hand!” District Conventions. Congregations will be sent enough invitations so that each pub-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">2. What special campaign is planned to advertise the Memorial, and who may have a share?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. What might we say to invite people to the Memorial?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Usher can have 50 copies and each pioneer can have 150 copies. Keep your presentation brief, perhaps saying: “This is your invitation to an upcoming important yearly event. You will be warmly welcomed. The details are on the invitation.” Of course, if the householder has questions, take the time to answer them. The appendix article on the Lord’s Evening Meal found in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font5"> book beginning on page 206 may be helpful in this regard. On weekends, we will offer the current magazines along with the special invitation. Keep track of any interest found, and arrange to call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Wherever possible, this special invitation should be handed personally to each householder. Therefore, make a record of not-at-homes, and arrange to call again at another time. Congregations that have a generous supply of invitations left over may leave them at not-at-homes during the last week before the Memorial, but not before that. Make sure that your return visits, Bible students, relatives, workmates, neighbors, and other acquaintances also receive an invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Auxiliary Pioneering: </span><span class="font5">Can you declare Jehovah’s excellencies more fully by auxiliary pioneering during March, April, and May? Doing so will likely require some adjustments in your daily schedule. (Eph. 5:15-17) You can be sure that making an effort to do more in Jehovah’s service will bring joy and</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s blessing. (Prov. 10:22) Since the Memorial season is approaching, now is the time to begin making plans. —Prov. 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> One 90-year-old sister enjoyed the privilege of auxiliary pioneering last year. She stated: “Even though I really love gardening and wanted to start planting, I realized I needed to get my priorities straight. With a desire to put Kingdom interests first, I decided to auxiliary pioneer in March.” Was she blessed for her efforts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">She says, “I feel more a part of the congregation, and this has drawn me closer to Jehovah.” Can we analyze our priorities and make similar adjustments as needed?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Meeting the auxiliary pioneer requirement of 50 hours may not be as difficult as you think. Prayerfully consider your daily activities, make a schedule, and then note it on your theocratic calendar. You know your personal circumstances best. If you have poor health and lack stamina, perhaps you could share in the ministry for a couple of hours each day. If you work full-time or go to school, you may be able to auxiliary pioneer by sharing in the ministry in the evenings or on weekends.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">ry pioneer as a family. In previous years one married couple hesitated to enroll because they felt their circumstances did not allow them to auxiliary pioneer. What did they do about it? “We prayed to Jehovah to help us accomplish what we had wanted to do together for so long.” With proper planning they were able to reach their goal. They added: “It was wonderful. We enjoyed many blessings together. Our suggestion is, try it. If we did it, you may be able to do it too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> Why not set aside time during your next family study to consider how all can increase their activity during the coming months? Even if your entire family cannot auxiliary pioneer, perhaps one member can do so with help and cooperation from the other members of the household. If not, possibly your family can set goals to spend additional time in the ministry during these special months of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Help One Another: </span><span class="font5">Enthusiasm is contagious. Talk about your desire to auxiliary pioneer. This may encourage others to apply. In addition, those who have pioneered in the past may be able to give you suggestions that will help you to arrange your affairs and sched-</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Many elders make the necessary arrangements to participate in this special avenue of service. (Heb. 13:7) This is indeed encouraging to the congregation! Elders also build enthusiasm by their conversations with others. A few kind words of encouragement or some practical suggestions may be just what is needed to move some to auxiliary pioneer. The service overseer will likely be arranging additional meetings for field service so that all can engage in group witnessing, even after work or school. These arrangements should be announced regularly. He will also make sure that all have sufficient territory and literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Even if circumstances prevent you from auxiliary pioneering, you can offer encouragement to those who enroll, and you can pray for them. (Prov. 25:11; Col. 4:12) Perhaps you may be able to make arrangements to share with them in the ministry an additional day during the week or to stay out longer than you usually do.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Goa! of 160,000 Auxiliary Pioneers in April: </span><span class="font5">The all-time peak of auxiliary pioneers for the United States branch was 153,774, reached in April 2000.

We can reach it if an average of just 1 out of every 6 publishers in each congregation engages in the auxiliary pioneer work. Of course, some congregations will have even more publishers whose circumstances allow them to auxiliary pioneer. Such a congregation goal is easily within reach for most congregations. Imagine the excitement this will generate in your congregation and the positive effect it will have on the preaching work in your territory!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Why is April an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer? The Memorial will be at the beginning of the month, giving us ample opportunity to make follow-up visits on those who attend. We will be offering the magazines, with the objective of placing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font5">book on return visits and starting Bible studies. Therefore, auxiliary pioneering in April will provide many opportunities for starting Bible studies. In this country the days are longer and the weather is usually mild. In addition, the month of April has five Sundays and a worldly holiday, making it easier for those who work secularly and those who attend school to enroll.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Each Memorial season that passes brings us one year closer to the end of this system of things. The time left to tell others about our great God is reduced. (1 Cor. 7:29) Once this Memorial season has passed, the precious opportunities it gave us to praise our heavenly Father will be gone forever. May we make preparations now to do all we can during March, April, and May to declare abroad the excellencies of Jehovah!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The Great Teacher, Jesus, always explained things in a simple, clear way. To stimulate the thinking of his listeners, at times he first asked them for their viewpoint. (Matt. 17:2427) He directed attention to God’s Word. (Matt. 26:31; Mark 7:6) He was careful not to overwhelm his disciples with too much information, knowing that they would continue to learn. (John 16:12) Jesus was also Interested in whether his disciples believed and understood what he taught them. (Matt. 13:51) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font4">book is designed to help us teach in a similar manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Introductory Questions: </span><span class="font4">When you begin a chapter, it is good to call attention to the introductory questions under the title. Raise the questions rhetorically to whet the student’s appetite. Or you could invite him to comment briefly on the questions. There is no need to discuss his comments at length or to correct every wrong statement. You may simply thank him for his thoughts and begin consideration of the material. His comments on the introductory questions will help you to know if you need to give more attention to a certain portion of the lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Scriptures: </span><span class="font4">The study should center on the Scriptures. (Heb. 4:12) However, it is not necessary to read every</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">1. How did Jesus teach?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. In what ways can we use the introductory questions for each chapter?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">3. How can we keep the study simple?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">cited text. Emphasize those that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs. Texts that provide background information may not need to be read. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font4"> book presents the truth in an uncomplicated way. Keep the study simple. Focus on the main points, and avoid the tendency to talk too much about details or to bring outside material into the discussion unnecessarily.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Appendix: </span><span class="font4">The appendix covers 14 topics that supplement the main text. Discussing these topics during the study is optional. For some subjects, you may choose to encourage your student to read the supplementary material on his own, especially if he understands and accepts the information in the main text. For example, if the student already believes that Jesus is the Messiah, it may not be necessary to consider with him the topic “Jesus Christ—The Promised Messiah” when discussing chapter 4, “Who Is Jesus Christ?” On other occasions, it may be beneficial to take time during the study to discuss the appendix material or a portion thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> If you choose to discuss the appendix material, you may prepare questions in advance and consider the paragraphs</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4. What determines whether we should take time during the study to consider information from the appendix?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. If we choose to consider information from the appendix, how may we do it? with the student just as you would the main text. Or depending upon the needs of the student, you may choose to take a few minutes during the study to review the information with him. That will allow you to make sure he understands the material that he read on his own.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Review Box: </span><span class="font4">The box at the end of each chapter provides statements that usually answer the introductory questions. You can use these statements to review the main points of the chapter. Some publishers have found it helpful to read each statement and perhaps the accompanying scriptures with the student. They then ask the student to explain briefly how the scriptures prove the statement. This shows the teacher whether the student clearly understands the main points of the lesson and how these are supported by the Bible and whether he agrees with them. It also trains the student to use the Bible to explain the truth to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The most effective way to fulfill our commission to teach people and to make disciples is to imitate Jesus’ methods of teaching. (Matt. 28:19, 20) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font4"> book can help us to do that. Make good use of it to teach others the truth in a clear, simple, and interesting way.</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup>Are you acquainted with anyone who has become inactive? Perhaps he has stopped associating with the congregation and has drifted away. You may have contacted such a person while engaging in the house-to-house ministry. We must keep in mind that the individual continues to be our spiritual brother. We want to confirm our love for him and help him to return to the congregation and to ‘the shepherd and overseer of our souls.’ - 1 Pet. 2:25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Demonstrate Interest: </span><span class="font4">A. brief telephone call or visit may assure one who has become inactive that we have not forgotten him. What could we say? We may be encouraging by simply letting the person know that we were thinking of him. Keep the conversation positive and upbuilding. (Phil. 4:8) We might mention a point that we enjoyed from a recent meeting. We could also invite him to an upcoming meeting or assembly and offer to save him a seat or provide transportation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> A sister who had been inactive for more than 20 years was found in the territory. Although she was unwilling to accept a Bible study, the sister who found her called back, leaving the current magazines. After the district convention, the publisher shared some convention highlights with the inactive sister, and eventually she was reactivated.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">1. Why should we reach out to encourage those who have become inactive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">2. How may we offer encouragement to an inactive one?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">3. How was one sister reactivated?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> When Someone Returns: </span><span class="font4">When an inactive brother begins coming back to the meetings, how should we treat him? Well, how did Jesus treat his disciples after they had temporarily abandoned him? He warmly referred to them as his “brothers” and showed confidence in them. He even gave them an important assignment. (Matt. 28:10, 18, 19) Shortly thereafter, they were busy declaring the good news “without letup.”—Acts 5:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Before offering to study the Bible with someone who has become inactive or before inviting a brother who has been inactive a long time to accompany us in the ministry, we should seek direction from the elders. If we come across an inactive publisher in the territory, we should inform the elders so that they can render needed assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> As the Bible clearly shows, only those who run the course to the finish will receive salvation. (Matt. 24:13) Therefore, take note of those who may have stumbled or drifted away. If we patiently reflect Jehovah’s love by demonstrating sincere interest in such ones, we may experience the joy of seeing them resume their sacred service alongside us.—Luke 15: 4-10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">January 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America km-EUs1/02 Vol. 45, No. 1</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep the Kingdom First</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Cutting God’s Kingdom first in life and keeping it there is not easy when we are faced with economic pressures or other problems. How do we </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">keep</span><span class="font13"> the Kingdom first when difficulties arise? What if we are offered a job that requires us to miss the meetings or that interferes with our field service? Must the Kingdom then take second place in life?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Strong Faith Is Necessary: </span><span class="font13">When our faith is tested under such circumstances, we must not lose sight of Jehovah’s promise and Jesus’ assurance of divine support if we seek first the Kingdom. (Ps. 37:25; Matt. 6:31-34) Worldly influences and pressures could cloud our view and prevent us from keeping the Kingdom paramount. Some have allowed prospects for prominence on the job or for financial gain to become the main thing in life. However, like Paul, we need to appraise accurately what really counts in life.—Phil. 3:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Are Adjustments Needed? </span><span class="font13">A publisher said: “My heart was in my business—it was my greatest love. I felt I could still be a Witness while dedicating most of my time to business interests.” But she had a nagging feeling that she could do more to serve Jehovah. In time, she gave up the business that was an obstacle to her spiritual progress. Once she wholly devoted herself to the Kingdom work, she was able to say: “Now I feel my life is successful in Jehovah’s eyes, which is what really matters.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Commendably, many have given up secular careers and prospects for greater financial returns, simplified their lives, and entered the full-time service. Young, single ministerial servants and elders attending the Ministerial Training School have done this and are enjoying fine privileges of service. Imitating the sterling example of Paul, they are genuinely content with basic material provisions.—! Cor. 11:1; 1 Tim. 6:6-8; Heb. 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> While our view of life may be ridiculed by the world, we have Jehovah’s blessing. (1 Cor. 1:26-31) Is it not encouraging to know that he will use us as fully as possible and will help us to accomplish his work? Our present opportunity to proclaim God’s established Kingdom will never be repeated. So now is the time to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">keep </span><span class="font13">the Kingdom first in our lives.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘How Will They Hear?’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus emphatically stated: “In all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) Despite our diligent efforts, there are yet hundreds of millions of people who have not received a personal witness. Some governments restrict our work. Many lands have vast populations that keep growing at a fast pace. Hence, ‘how will they hear?’—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Have Confidence in Jehovah: </span><span class="font13">We must remember that Jehovah knows the heart condition of all people. No matter what a person’s situation is, if he sincerely searches for the truth about God, he will find it. —1 Chron. 28:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Abraham was anxious about the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. But God assured him that Sodom would not be destroyed even if only ten righteous people were found there. (Gen. 18:20, 23, 25, 32) Jehovah has never destroyed the righteous along with the wicked, as was shown by the deliverance of Lot and his daughters—2 Pet. 2: 6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Elijah once thought that he was totally alone in serving the true God. However, Jehovah assured him that he was far from being alone and that the work he had begun would be completed. (1 Ki. 19:14-18) What about the situation in our day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Stay Busy in God’s Service: </span><span class="font13">On how much greater a scale the witness work is yet to be done, we do not know. Jehovah is responsible for this work and is using his angels to oversee it. (Rev. 14:6, 7) He is the one to determine to what extent the witness is to be given to all the nations. If Jehovah chooses, he can see that the Kingdom message is spread in ways that we cannot yet imagine so that many more people may “hear the word of the good news and believe.” (Acts 15:7) What Jehovah does will be in full harmony with who he is—a loving, wise, and just God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> It is our privilege to work in harmony with Jehovah’s will, doing our best to let everyone hear the good news.—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font12">Benefiting From Kind Provisions. Talk by a qualified elder, based on the December 1, 2001, outline from the branch office. The congregation should have a sufficient quantity of the following items on hand for distribution: Advance Medical Directive/ Release card, Identity Card, the health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) form, and the Advance Directive Guide. These documents will be made available to baptized publishers after tonight’s meeting, but they should NOT be filled out tonight. Signing, witnessing, and dating of cards will be done at the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the Individual sign the document. The Advance Directive Guide should be carefully considered before completing the DPA. If you have already executed a DPA, it will not be necessary to complete another one unless your current one is dated prior to 2001 or does not express your present wishes. If a publisher has moved to another state, he should execute a new DPA form for that state. Unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive for themselves and their children by adapting language from these documents to their own circumstances and convictions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">* Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Set Something Aside”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the early Christian congregation, there were material needs that required attention. As each person prospered, he was urged to “set something aside” as a contribution to meet those needs. (1 Cor. 16:1-3) As a result of their generosity, all rejoiced at giving “many expressions of thanks to God.”—2 Cor. 9:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Today the worldwide work of Jehovah’s people keeps expanding, requiring ever-increasing financial support. It is appropriate that we too “set something aside” regularly to help fill the need. (2 Cor. 8:3, 4) Material giving can be done in a variety of ways. (See the November 1, 2001, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> pages 28-9.) We rightly view this as a privilege that brings real happiness. —Acts 20:35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Suggestions for Presenting the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Brochure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">“No doubt you would agree that many people believe in God. All who do believe in him agree that God requires something from us. What people cannot agree on is, What does God require of us?” Then present the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure, turn to lesson 1, and discuss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“With so many problems in family life today, have you ever wondered what is the secret for achieving family happiness?” After a response, explain that in the Bible, God reveals the real secret of family happiness. Read Isaiah 48:17. Then turn to lesson 8 in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure, and point to some of the cited Bible verses that provide reliable guidance for each member of the family. Read the list of questions at the beginning of the lesson. Ask if the person would like to read the answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“This brochure contains a well-rounded-out study course covering the basic teachings of the Bible. On each page, you will find answers to questions that have troubled people for centuries. For example, What is God’s purpose for the earth?” Turn to lesson 5, and read the questions at the start of the lesson. Ask the householder which one interests him the most, and then read the corresponding paragraph(s), looking up appropriate scriptures. Explain that satisfying answers to the other questions can be found just as easily as this one. Suggest that you return again to discuss another question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“What do you think is the reason for all the violence in public schools? Does it result from a lack of parental training? Or could it be something else, such as the influence of the Devil?” Allow for a response. If the person says that it is because of the Devil’s influence, read Revelation 12:9, 12. Point out the Devil’s role in promoting turmoil in the world. Then open the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure to lesson 4, and ask if the person ever wondered where the Devil came from. Proceed to read and discuss the first two paragraphs. If the person chooses “a lack of parental training” as the reason for violence in the schools, read 2 Timothy 3:1-3 and point out the traits that evidently contribute to this problem.

<p><span class="font13">“We are asking people if they believe this . . .” Read Genesis 1:1, and then ask: “Do you agree with that statement?” If the person agrees, then say: “I do too. However, do you think that if God created all things, he is also responsible for wickedness?” After acknowledging the person’s response, read Ecclesiastes 7:29. Open the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book to chapter 8, and read paragraph 2.

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Direct Approach</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">To start a Bible study, try using one of these direct approaches:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Did you know that in just a few minutes, you can find the answer to an important Bible question? For example, .. .” Then, pose a question that appears at the beginning of one of the lessons in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure and that you think would appeal to the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I stopped by to show you our free Bible study program. It takes about five minutes to demonstrate. Do you have five minutes?” If the answer is yes, use lesson 1 in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure to demonstrate the study, reading only one or two selected scriptures. Afterward, ask: “When would you have about 15 minutes so that we can cover the next lesson?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Many people have a Bible, but they do not realize that it holds the answers to the important questions we all have about our future. Using this study aid [the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book] for an hour or so a week, you can gain a basic understanding of the Bible in just a few months. I would be happy to show you how the program works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I’m calling to offer you a free home Bible course. If I may, I’d like to take just a few minutes to demonstrate how people in some 200 lands discuss the Bible at home as family groups. We can use any of these topics as a basis for discussion. [Show the table of contents in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book.] Which one especially interests you?” Wait for the person to make a selection.

<p><span class="font0">“I give Bible lessons free of charge and have openings in my schedule for additional students. This Bible study aid is what we use. [Show the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book.] The course lasts only a few months and provides answers to such questions as: Why does God permit suffering? Why do we grow old and die? What happens to our dead loved ones? And how can we draw close to God? May I demonstrate a lesson?”</span></p>

Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure, with a view to starting Bible studies. ■ All baptized publishers present at the Service Meeting the week of January 14 may obtain the Advance Medical Directive/Release card and the Identity Card for their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 3, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Finding Security in a Dangerous World.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ As announced at the 2001 district convention, the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education</span><span class="font12"> will be made available beginning early in 2002. Starting January 1, 2002, literature requests for this book in English, Korean, and Spanish can be submitted through the congregations. Until it is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Additional languages will be announced later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Thursday, March 28, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font12"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion, allowing time to meet visitors and encourage newly interested ones. Consideration should be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Researchers and others have contacted a number of brothers, seeking information about Jehovah’s Witnesses and our organization. They have requested that survey forms be completed, supplying answers to questions related to our beliefs and teachings. If such individuals approach a congregation publisher, he should provide the name of the presiding overseer. The elders can handle such inquiries and make an appropriate response based on a letter addressed to all bodies of elders, dated April 25, 2001.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ When the presiding overseer receives the New York Corporation Statement each month, he should see that all acknowledgments of contributions for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund and for the worldwide work are read to the congregation with the next accounts report.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>New Corporations Formed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">The January 15, 2001, issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> reported on the organized way in which Jehovah’s Witnesses are continuing to move forward with the Kingdom work in all the earth. It also explained how various legal entities are used as instruments to facilitate the spreading of the good news. Such entities or corporations are necessary to conform to local and national laws, as required by God’s Word. (Rom. 13:1) Because of the diversity and scope of our work, the Governing Body has approved the formation of additional corporations to care for certain needs of Jehovah’s Witnesses here in the United States. The new corporations are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Order of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Support Services, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These will operate along with Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. Congregations and publishers may receive correspondence from any of these corporations. Your cooperation with these adjustments made by the Governing Body in fulfilling its assignment to care for all the Master’s belongings will be greatly appreciated. —Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” (Prov. 22:6) Parents, if you do not want your children to “turn aside from” the way of the truth, when should such training begin? Early in life!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When Paul said that Timothy’s spiritual education was “from infancy,” evidently he meant from babyhood. (2 Tim. 3: 14, 15) As a result, Timothy developed into an excellent spiritual man. (Phil. 2:19-22) Parents, you too must start “from infancy” to give your children the training they need to ‘grow up with Jehovah.’—1 Sam. 2:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Supply the Water They Need to Grow: </span><span class="font13">Just as saplings need a constant supply of water to grow into stately trees, children of all ages need to be saturated with the water of Bible truth to grow into mature servants of God. The primary way to teach children the truth and to help them gain an intimacy with Jehovah is by means of a regular, family Bible study. But parents, consider each child’s attention span. For young children, likely frequent abbreviated sessions of instruction would be more effective than a few long ones.—Deut. 11:18, 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Never underestimate your children’s potential to learn. Tell them stories about Bible characters. Let them draw pictures of Bible scenes or act out Bible events. Make good use of our videos and audiocassettes, including the Bible dramas. Adapt the family study to the ages and learning abilities of your children. Initial training will be elementary, in small amounts; but as a child grows older, his training should become more expansive and progressive. Make Bible instruction lively and varied. You want your children to “form a longing” for the Word, so make the study as tasty as you can.—1 Pet. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Involve Them in the Congregation: </span><span class="font13">Set progressive goals for your children so that they become fully involved in the congregation. What might be their first goal? The parents of two young children said: “Both started to receive training to sit quietly in the Kingdom Hall.” Later, help children to comment at the meetings in their own words and to make it their goal to enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School. In the field service, good goals to be achieved would be to offer a tract at the door, to read a scripture, to give a magazine presentation, and to engage householders in meaningful conversations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Provide an Enthusiastic Example: </span><span class="font13">Do your children daily hear you speak about Jehovah and pray to him? Do they see you study his Word, attend meetings, share in the field ministry, and find delight in doing God’s will? (Ps. 40:8) It is vital that they do and that you do these things together. A grown daughter said of her mother, who had reared six children to become faithful Witnesses: “What impressed us the most was Mother’s own example—it spoke louder than words.” A parent of four stated: “ ‘Jehovah comes first’ was not just a common phrase but the way we lived our lives.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Parents, start early to train your children, teaching them the truth from God’s Word, setting progressive goals, and providing the best possible example. You will be happy you did!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Others to Glorify Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Avital message is being proclaimed to people throughout the earth: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.” (Rev. 14:6, 7) It is our privilege to share in that proclamation. What do people need to know about Jehovah in order to fear and worship him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> His Name: </span><span class="font15">People need to be able to distinguish by name the only true God from the many false gods worshiped today. (Deut. 4:35; 1 Cor. 8:5, 6) In fact, Bible writers used Jehovah’s illustrious name more than 7,000 times. While we properly use discernment as to when we introduce God’s name, we should never hide it or shy away from using it. God’s will is that all mankind come to know his name.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> His Personality: </span><span class="font15">To glorify Jehovah, people need to know what kind of God he is. We must acquaint them with his outstanding love, superlative wisdom, complete justice, and almighty power, along with his mercy, loving-kindness, and other wonderful qualities. (Ex. 34:6, 7) They must also learn to have a wholesome fear of God, to hold him in awe, recognizing that their very lives depend on having Jehovah’s approval.—Ps. 89:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Drawing Close to God: </span><span class="font15">To be saved through God’s coming judgment, people must call on Jehovah in faith. (Rom. 10: 13, 14; 2 Thess. 1:8) This involves more than simply gaining a knowledge of God’s name and qualities. We must help people develop a personal relationship with Jehovah, trusting in him with all their heart. (Prov. 3:5, 6) As they apply what they learn, turn to God in earnest prayer, and experience his hand in their lives, their faith will grow, helping them to draw close to Jehovah.—Ps. 34:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> May we zealously declare God’s name and help others to put their full trust in him and to fear him. We may yet be able to help many more come to know Jehovah and glorify him as their “God of salvation.”—Ps. 25:5.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Appreciation for Theocratic Resources</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> When making arrangements to repair the temple, King Josiah commended those assigned to do the work, saying: “No accounting should be taken of the money with them into whose hand it is being put, for it is in faithfulness that they are working.” (2 Ki. 22:3-7) The appreciation those men had for sacred things was evident in how they handled the resources entrusted to them. Today, as we engage in the holy work of the good news of God, we likewise need to show faithfulness in handling the resources given to us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In the Field Ministry: </span><span class="font15">Appreciation for the vital message contained in our publications and awareness of the cost involved in producing them causes us to value them highly. We should not offer our literature indiscriminately to those who show no real appreciation for the Bible’s message. If a person shows little interest in the good news, we might offer him a tract rather than other literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Distribute literature in a way that shows regard for its value. Avoid leaving it in public areas where it will simply get strewn about. To avoid waste, take inventory of what you have on hand at home before obtaining more literature. If you regularly have a surplus of each issue of the magazines, consider reducing your order.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Publications for Personal Use: </span><span class="font15">We should order only what publications we actually need. Especially should we be moderate when requesting deluxe Bibles, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reference Bibles,</span><span class="font15"> and other large publications, such as the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Concordance, Index, Insight</span><span class="font15"> volumes, and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font15"> book, all of which are produced at considerable cost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Do you make it a point to write your name and address in your personal copies of the publications? This helps to reduce the need to obtain replacements for publications that are misplaced. If you lose a songbook, Bible, or study publication, perhaps you will And it among the lost items collected at the Kingdom Hall or assembly site.—Luke 15:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> Let us strive to make wise use of our literature. This is a way to demonstrate our faithfulness in handling the Kingdom resources Jehovah has entrusted to us.—Luke 16:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">Why a Lack of Faith? Audience discussion. We often encounter people who have little faith. (2 Thess. 3:2) To reach them with the truth about Jehovah, we should first try to determine what has influenced their thinking about God. Consider the four factors mentioned in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book, pages 129-30, that can hinder people from acquiring faith. Invite audience to suggest what approach could be used in each case.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font14">The Challenges Facing Single Parents. An elder interviews one or two single parents (or those whose mates are not Witnesses) to see how they cope with problems related to training, disciplining, and spiritually guiding their children. How are they able to care for family responsibilities and also get to meetings and out in field service regularly? Highlight some suggestions presented in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font14"> book, pages 10410. As pointed out on pages 113-15, mention practical ways that others can assist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font14">“Fear God and Give Him Glory.” (Rev. 14:7) Talk and audience discussion reviewing the circuit assembly program that was held during the past service year. Invite the congregation to comment on key points learned and on how they were able to apply them personally or as family groups. (Portions can be assigned In advance.) Feature these program parts: (1) “Help New Ones to Cultivate Fear of God.” How can we assist interested ones who attended the Memorial to progress and become active servants of Jehovah? (2) “Fear of Jehovah Means the Hating of Bad.” (u)87 4/15 16-18) How can Proverbs 6:16-19 help us to turn away from things that Jehovah hates —pride, lying, materialistic pursuits, unwholesome entertainment, misuse of the Internet? (3) “Draw Ever Closer to Those You Love.” We love Jehovah, Jesus, family members, others in the congregation; how does drawing close to them safeguard us from the world? (4) “Fear Jehovah, Not Men.” How has fear of displeasing Jehovah helped you to overcome timidity when preaching, to adhere to godly principles at work or school, or to resist pressure from your employer to miss meetings, assemblies, and conventions? (5) “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” (Ps. 119:37; Heb. 4:13) Why should godly fear prevent us from drinking immoderately, viewing pornography, or practicing other concealed sins? (6) “Keep On Walking in the Fear of Jehovah.” How has Jehovah blessed you for making room for his spirit to operate fully in your life?—Ps. 31:19; 33:18; 34:9, 17; 145:19.</span></p>

(6) They explain the real meaning behind world events. (7) They show how to cope with today’s problems. (8) They appeal to people of all walks of life. (9) They stay politically neutral.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> In 1983 at the “Kingdom Unity” District Conventions in the United States, it was announced that a special fund would be established to support the construction and remodeling of Kingdom Halls throughout the United States and Canada. Little did we realize what blessings would result from such small beginnings. We began to experience more fully what Psalm 92:4 so aptly states: “For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your activity; because of the works of your hands I cry out joyfully.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> We now rejoice greatly in what is being accomplished. Today an accelerated global Kingdom Hall construction program is under way. In one way or another, all of us have the privilege of sharing in this activity. We do so by making large or small monetary contributions to help finance the construction of more places of worship throughout the world. Many brothers also volunteer the use of their equipment as well as their time, abilities, and skills in connection with such projects. The success of the entire arrangement is due to Jehovah’s guidance, support, and rich blessing upon our united efforts.—Psalm 127:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Many branches have followed the pattern originally instituted for congregations in the United States. At Kingdom Halls in many lands, there is a box where publishers put their contributions for the Kingdom Hall Fund. In the United States, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font16"> for March 1997 announced an adjustment in this program. It stated: “Ever since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established in 1983, the brothers</span></p>
<div><img src="okm_E_200209_files/okm_E_200209-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:484pt;height:486pt;">
<p><span class="font18">—wn</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">have contributed generously, thus enabling loans to be made for Kingdom Hall construction. Already some 2,700 congregations in this country have benefited from this arrangement. Many congregations could not otherwise build new Kingdom Halls or renovate those in need of repair. There is now an urgent need to use some of these contributed funds to provide loans to congregations in economically depressed countries. Your continued support of this arrangement is greatly appreciated by the Society and by those congregations that benefit from your contributions.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> That announcement served as an in-</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">vitation to participate in an accelerated Kingdom Hall construction program. The Kingdom Hall Fund would be expanded to embrace the needs of our brothers in other lands while continuing to provide loans for Kingdom Hall construction in this country. A subsequent article in the August 1997 issue of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font16"> stated: “There is an ongoing need for Kingdom Hall construction worldwide. During just the last service year, 3,288 new congregations were formed. Many of these congregations are in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe.”</span></p>

Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15,1991, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> regarding any dlsfellowshlpped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">each month</span><span class="font14"> before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature.

<p><span class="font14">■ At times, congregations and individual publishers face legal challenges relating to our worship of Jehovah. The booklet </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News </span><span class="font14">was published in 1950 to assist with these matters. Although this booklet has been of use in the past, the legal information it presents is no longer up-to-date. Thus, individual publishers and bodies of elders should not attempt to handle legal matters on the basis of the information contained in that booklet.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Avoid the Pursuit of “Valueless Things”</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> One popular means of communication today is E-mail. Although sharing personal experiences and thoughts among family and friends through this medium may be appropriate, what “valueless things” can be associated with the unrestricted use of E-mail?—Prov. 12:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Cautions Regarding E-Mail: </span><span class="font15">Some claim to feel more in touch with Jehovah’s organization when they receive what they consider to be fresh information via E-mail. This may include experiences, notes on events at Bethel, reports of disasters or persecution, and even confidential information released at Kingdom Ministry Schools. Others seem overly eager to send such messages, hoping to be the first to reveal the information to their friends.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> At times, information and experiences have been distorted or exaggerated. Or perhaps in an effort to be sensational, some have conveyed a false impression. Those who are hasty to reveal such matters often do not have all the facts. (Prov. 29:20) In some cases, even when a story is unbelievable, it is passed on as a curiosity. Such inaccurate or misleading reports amount to “false stories,” which do not promote genuine godly devotion. —1 Tim. 4:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> If you forward information that turns out to be inaccurate, you bear a measure of responsibility for the sorrow or confusion this can cause. When David received an exaggerated report that all his sons had been killed, he “ripped his clothes apart” in anguish. However, in truth, only one of his sons had died. That was distressing enough, but this exaggeration caused David added distress. (2 Sam. 13:30-33) Surely we would not want to do anything that would mislead or discourage any of our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> God’s Appointed Channel: </span><span class="font15">Bear in mind that our heavenly Father has an appointed channel of communication, “the faithful and discreet slave.” That “slave” has the responsibility to determine what information is made available to the household of faith, as well as “the proper time” for it to be dispensed. This spiritual food is available only through the theocratic organization. We should always look to God’s appointed channel for reliable information, not to a network of Internet users.—Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Internet Web Sites: </span><span class="font15">We have an official Internet Web site: </span><a href="http://www.watchtower.org"><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">www.watchtower.org</span></a><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font15"> This site is adequate to make information available to the public. There is no need for any individual, committee, or congregation to prepare a Web page about Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some have posted the contents of our publications with all scriptures and references given in full and have even offered copies of convention material on a donation basis. Whether profit is involved or not, the practice of reproducing and distributing publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses in an electronic document is a violation of copyright laws. While some may view this as a service to the brothers, it is not approved and should be discontinued.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">’Exercising good judgment and soundness of mind when using electronic communication will ensure that our minds are filled with “precious and pleasant things of value.”—Prov. 24:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Happiest People on Earth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” (Ps. 144:15) Those words describe Jehovah’s Witnesses as the happiest people on earth. There is no greater joy than that which comes from serving the only true and living God, Jehovah. Since he is “the happy God,” those who worship him reflect his delight. (1 Tim. 1:11) What are some aspects of our worship that contribute to our being so happy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Reasons for Being Happy: </span><span class="font15">Jesus assured us that happiness comes from being “conscious of [our] spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) Continually studying the Bible and attending all our Christian meetings satisfies that need. Learning the truth of God’s Word has set us free from religious falsehood and error. (John 8:32) The Scriptures have also taught us the best way of living. (Isa. 48:17) Because of that, we enjoy wholesome Christian fellowship within our happy association of brothers.—1 Thess. 2: 19, 20; 1 Pet. 2:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> We derive great contentment from obeying God’s high moral standards, for we know that this safeguards us and makes Jehovah happy. (Prov. 27:11) A newspaper reporter noted: “Despite all their strict standards, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not appear to be unhappy. To the contrary. The young as well as the older [ones among them] present an appearance of being unusually joyful and well balanced.” How can we help others to share our happy lot?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Help Others Find Happiness: </span><span class="font15">The world is filled with unhappiness, and people generally have a gloomy outlook on the future. However, we have a bright outlook, knowing that one day all sadness will be a thing of the past. (Rev. 21:3, 4) Therefore, we zealously share in the ministry, looking for hon-esthearted ones with whom to share our hope and our beliefs about Jehovah.—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> A pioneer sister said: “There is nothing more satisfying than helping people to get to know Jehovah and his truth.” Let us do all we can to encourage many more to accept home Bible studies. Serving Jehovah and giving of ourselves to help others serve him produces the greatest happiness.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Impact of Videos That Give a Witness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> “Our son has been watching the video since before he could walk. He watches it over and over again. How wonderful it is to have tools that instill love of Jehovah in our children!” Which video was this Christian parent describing? The one entitled </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Noah—He Walked With God.</span><span class="font15"> A non-Witness mother whose son had seen the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Noah</span><span class="font15"> video at someone else’s house sent the branch office a $90 donation and asked if we have any other videos for children. The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization are having a strong impact on young and old alike.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In the Family: </span><span class="font15">After a Witness family watched </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault,</span><span class="font15"> the mother related: “I have pondered all day on how Jehovah enabled ordinary people to endure extraordinary things! Thinking about that has reminded me of how relatively insignificant my own problems are. Viewing this video with our children has helped them to see more clearly the need to rely on Jehovah. By discussing it with them afterward, we have helped our daughters to be better equipped to handle whatever pressures and persecutions may come their way.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> At School: </span><span class="font15">As part of a report, a teenage Witness was able to show a portion of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Stand Firm</span><span class="font15"> video to his class. Previously, the teacher said that she did not like the Witnesses. After watching the video, she stated: “This has totally changed the way I look at Jehovah’s Witnesses. I promise that the next time they come to my door, I will listen to them and start studying the Bible with them!” What changed her impression of us? She said that it was our “true love and loyalty.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> In the Ministry: </span><span class="font15">A sister met a woman who hesitated to accept literature, although she had questions about us and our beliefs. The sister returned with the video </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —The Organization Behind the Name</span><span class="font15"> and played it for the woman and her husband. Both were greatly impressed and agreed to study the Bible. As a result of the fine witness given to them, they began conforming their lives to God’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Are you using our videos to their full potential?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Preach the Word of God Fully”</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> When you sincerely appreciate receiving something good, do you not show it by your attitude and actions? Of course you do! Regarding the goodness and loving-kindness that Jehovah extends to mankind, notice how the apostle Paul reacted. He exclaimed: “Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift”! What does that “free gift” include? All “the surpassing undeserved kindness of God” that has been shown to us, the greatest manifestation of which was the gift of his own Son as a ransom for our sins.—2 Cor. 9:14,15; John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Was Paul’s expression of thanks simply words on his part? By no means! In many ways he showed his deep appreciation. He was very much concerned about the spiritual welfare of his fellow Christians and wanted to do what he could to help them benefit to the full from God’s loving-kindness. Concerning such ones, Paul said: “Having a tender affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us.” (1 Thess. 2:8) In addition to helping those who were already part of the congregation to secure their salvation, Paul tirelessly preached the good news, traveling thousands of miles on land and sea to find those “who were rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) Paul’s deep appreciation for all that Jehovah had done for him moved him “to preach the word of God fully.”—Col. 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Does not our appreciation for all that Jehovah has done for us move us to offer spiritual assistance to those who need help in our congregation? (Gal. 6:10) And are we not moved to have as full a share as possible in preaching the good news of the Kingdom throughout our territory?—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> An Opportunity to Show Appreciation: </span><span class="font3">Each year the Memorial of Christ’s death gives us a special opportunity to show appreciation for what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us. This is not just another meeting or merely a memorial of an event. Jesus said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">me.”</span><span class="font3"> (Luke 22:19) The Memorial of Christ’s death is an occasion to call to mind the kind of person Jesus is. It is a time to recognize that he is alive and active today, with the glory and kingship that was given him for his faithful life course and sacrifice. This observance is also an opportunity to show our subjection to Christ’s headship as he directs the affairs and activities of the Christian congregation. (Col. 1:17-20) All of God’s people should respectfully be on hand for the Memorial of Christ’s death. This year it will be held after sundown on Thursday, March 28, 2002.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> With the diligent effort put forth prior to the observance of the Memorial last year, we had an all-time peak attendance of 2,163,602 in the United States branch. What will be the attendance this year? Much will depend on our “working hard and exerting ourselves,” helping as many as possible to attend.—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> In addition to attending the Lord’s Evening Meal, we may be able to increase our field service activity. No doubt, tens of thousands of brothers and sisters will auxiliary pioneer one or more months. Each year for the past five years, we have had an average of 212,142 auxiliary pioneers during the Memorial season, March through May. Can you arrange your affairs to enjoy the privilege of auxiliary pioneering this year? It would be a fine way to show your sincere appreciation for God’s loving provision of Christ’s sacrifice. You can be assured of Jehovah’s blessing, as the following experiences show.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> A sister who has a full-time secular job wrote about her experience of auxiliary pioneering last March: “The February 2001 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> encouraged everyone whose circumstances permitted to auxiliary pioneer during the Memorial season. Since March had five Saturdays, this fitted well with my schedule. So I decided to turn in my application.” As she began the month, she set a goal for herself of trying to start a home Bible study. Did she succeed? Yes, in her 52nd hour of witnessing that month! Her conclusion? “There are wonderful blessings when we make the extra effort.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> What are the benefits to a family that pioneers together? A family of four that did so last April found it to be a month that will always be remembered. The mother said: “What a positive outlook we had for each day, since we were united in the ministry! Discussions on our daily activities in the service made dinnertime very enjoyable.” The son said: “I enjoyed working in the field service with Dad during the week, when he is normally working secularly.” The father added: “As the family head, I felt satisfaction in knowing that we were working together in the most important activity of our time.” Can your family pioneer together? Why not have a family discussion and see if it is possible for your whole household to auxiliary pioneer during this Memorial season?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Can We Make March Our Best Month Ever? </span><span class="font3">Early in 2000, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> posed the question: “Can We Make April 2000 Our Best Month Ever?” What was the response? Several new peaks were reached. There was an all-time one-month peak of 153,774 auxiliary pioneers. In addition, we had new peaks in hours, magazine placements, and return visits. Do you recall the enthusiasm that was generated in your congregation by the flurry of spiritual activity during that special month? Can we equal or even surpass those accomplishments this year? With concerted effort by all, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">March 2002 </span><span class="font3">can become “Our Best Month Ever.” Why March?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> There are two reasons why March should be a special month of activity. First, the Memorial will be held toward the end of March, giving us ample opportunity early in the month to invite as many as possible to attend. Second, this year March has five full weekends, making it easier to auxiliary pioneer for those who work secularly or who attend school. Why not sit down now and plan a workable schedule, using the calendar provided in this insert? Auxiliary pioneering may be easier than you think. For example, by scheduling 8 hours of field service each of the five weekends, you would need to schedule only 10 additional hours during the rest of the month to reach the required 50 hours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> What can the elders do to help all in the congregation to “preach the word of God fully”? Build enthusiasm through meeting parts and personal conversations. Congregation Book Study overseers and their assistants can take the initiative to speak with each one assigned to their group and offer personal assistance. A few kind words of encouragement or some practical suggestions may be just what is needed. (Prov. 25:11) Many will see that with some slight adjustments in their schedule, they can enjoy the privilege of serving as auxiliary pioneers. In a number of congregations, most, if not all, of the elders and ministerial servants and their wives set a fine example by auxiliary pioneering together during the Memorial season. This has encouraged scores of publishers to join them. Because of physical limitations or other circumstances, some publishers may not be in a position to pioneer, but they can be encouraged to demonstrate their appreciation by doing as much as they can in the ministry along with the rest of the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Success depends on careful planning on the part of the elders. Meetings for field service should be scheduled at convenient times throughout the week. If possible, the service overseer will assign in advance qualified brothers to conduct all meetings for service. Good preparation will be required so that these meetings do not exceed 10 to 15 minutes, including organizing groups, assigning territory, and saying a prayer. (See the Question Box in the September 2001 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.)</span><span class="font3"> A schedule of activity for the month should be clearly explained to the congregation and posted on the information board.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Adequate territory should be made available. The service overseer should meet with the brother handling territories to make arrangements for working the ones not covered frequently. Emphasis should be put on working not-at-homes, witnessing on the streets and from store to store, and doing evening witnessing. Where appropriate, some publishers may be helped to do telephone witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Help Them to Serve Again: </span><span class="font3">Are any in your congregation’s territory no longer active in preaching the good news? Such ones are still part of the congregation and are in need of help. (Ps. 119:176) Since the end of this old world is so close and the new world is just ahead, we have good reason to put forth every effort to assist those who have become inactive. (Rom. 13:11, 12) Over the past five years, more than 26,500 people each year have responded to help and been reactivated. What can we do to help many more rekindle the love and confidence they had at the start?—Heb. 3:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The body of elders will want to discuss how they can help those who have become inactive during the past few years. (Matt. 18:12-14) The secretary should check the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards and make a note of all those who have become inactive. A special effort should be made through the shepherding arrangement to provide assistance. An elder might want to call on a certain publisher because of previous acquaintance and association with that one, or other publishers may be asked to help. Maybe they studied with the one who is now inactive and would welcome the opportunity to be of special assistance in this time of need. Hopefully, many of those who became inactive will be moved to start preaching the word of God again. If they qualify, there is no better time for them to start than during the Memorial season!—See the Question Box in the November 2000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> for further details.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> Do Others Qualify to Preach? </span><span class="font3">Jehovah continues to bless his people by bringing in “the desirable things of all the nations.” (Hag. 2:7) Each year thousands qualify as unbaptized publishers. Who are they? Children of Jehovah’s Witnesses as well as progressive Bible students. How do we know if they qualify to be publishers of the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Children of Jehovah’s Witnesses: </span><span class="font3">Many children have accompanied their parents from house to house for years, although they are not yet serving as unbaptized publishers. March may be a good time to get them started. How do you know if your child is qualified? Page 100 in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry</span><span class="font3"> says that it is “when a child is exemplary in his conduct and is able to make a personal expression of his faith by speaking to others about the good news, being moved from the heart to do so.” If you think that your child qualifies, speak with one of the elders on the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Qualified Bible Students: </span><span class="font3">After a Bible student has taken in knowledge and attended meetings for a while, he may want to become a Kingdom publisher. If you are conducting the study with such a student, consider these questions: Is he making progress, consistent with his age and ability? Has he begun to share his faith informally with others? Is he putting on “the new personality”? (Col. 3:10) Does he meet the qualifications for unbaptized publishers, outlined on pages 97-9 in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font3"> book? If so, you should contact the Congregation Service Committee so that arrangements can be made for two elders to meet with you and the student. If he qualifies, the two elders will inform him that he can begin sharing in the public ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> What About April and May? </span><span class="font3">These will also be special months for increased activity in the field ministry. Many who auxiliary pioneer in March may be able to do so again in April and/or May. During April and May, we will give priority to featuring the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines in the ministry. What beneficial effects they have had on the lives of those who read them! These magazines have played a large role in achieving the marvelous increase that has been experienced worldwide. A special effort will be put forth during April and May to offer the magazines to as many people as possible. Plan now to have a full share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> With the increased preaching activity planned, do you need to increase the number of magazines you obtain through the congregation? Throughout the service year, we feature </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> each Saturday, our designated Magazine Day. However, since many will be sharing in the auxiliary pioneer service and all of us will be featuring the magazines for two full months, it may be necessary to increase your magazine order with the congregation. If so, please inform the magazine servant in your congregation immediately. At the same time, the literature servant should be sure that a good supply of the tract </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font3"> is on hand for all to use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Many have expressed appreciation for the feature in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> entitled “What to Say About the Magazines.” Have you taken advantage of this provision by learning the sample magazine presentations? Why not use a portion of your family</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Bible study each week to practice these presentations?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> Make the Most of This Memorial Season: </span><span class="font3">Like the apostle Paul, let us show Jehovah how much we appreciate “his indescribable free gift” by our full participation in the spiritual activities planned for this Memorial season. These include (1) attending the most important occasion of the year, the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal on Thursday, March 28, 2002; (2) helping those who have become inactive to rekindle “the love [they] had at first” (Rev. 2:4; Rom. 12:11); (3) assisting our children and any Bible students who qualify to become unbaptized publishers; and (4) being involved in the evangelizing work as fully as possible, even auxiliary pioneering in March and beyond.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> It is our earnest prayer that all of us will have a full share in preaching the good news of the Kingdom this Memorial season, thus showing the depth of our appreciation for all that Jehovah has done for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">■ Literature offer for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Life —How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Handl,</span><span class="font14"> or any older 192-page book that the congregation has in stock. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font14"> A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April and May: </span><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> magazines. Publishers should inform householders that they may contribute to the worldwide work if they so desire. Where interest is shown, offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font14"> brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font14">brochure or the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories are accessible to nearby congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ On Saturday, May 11, 2002, the branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters. See also paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> insert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Beware of fraudulent schemes that have been circulating on the Internet and in the mail to solicit money for our brothers under the guise of assisting victims of disasters. Whenever circumstances require forming a relief committee to provide material assistance for Jehovah’s Witnesses, responsible brothers will be notified. Donations for such needs should be sent to Watch Tower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The special public talk for the 2002 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 14. The subject of the talk will be “Keep Close in Mind the ‘FearInspiring Day’!” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer or an assembly that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 14, 2002.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Why Keep On Preaching?</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Has the Kingdom-preaching work been carried on in your community for a long time? (Matt. 24:14) If so, you may feel that the congregation’s territory has been adequately covered. Now when you preach, perhaps most people you meet seem apathetic toward the Kingdom message. Even so, note what is acknowledged about Jesus’ true disciples on page 141 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah’s Prophecy II</span><span class="font15"> book: “In some places, the results of their ministry may seem insignificant when compared with the amount of work and effort expended. Still, they endure.” But why keep on preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Remember Jeremiah: </span><span class="font15">Our enduring faithfully in the preaching work should not depend on whether people listen to us or not. Jeremiah preached for 40 years in the same territory even though very few listened to him and many were opposed to his message. Why did Jeremiah persevere? Because he was doing a work that God commanded him to do and his knowledge of what was going to happen in the future compelled him to keep speaking out.—Jer. 1:17; 20:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> Our situation is similar. Jesus has “ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the One decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.” (Acts 10:42) The message that we bear is a matter of life and death to those who hear it. People will be judged on the basis of their response to the good news. That being so, our responsibility is to do exactly as we have been commanded to do. Even when people refuse to listen, this gives us the opportunity to show the depth of our love for them and of our devotion to Jehovah by persisting in doing what we must. But there is more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> We Are Benefiting: </span><span class="font15">Doing God’s will, regardless of the response in the territory, gives us inner peace, satisfaction, and happiness, which cannot be found in any other way. (Ps. 40:8) Our lives take on real meaning and purpose. The more we share in the ministry, the more our hearts and minds are focused on the hope and joy of living in God’s new world. Dwelling on these Scriptural promises enhances our spirituality and strengthens our relationship with Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Even if we do not see immediate results in our preaching activity, a seed of truth may have been planted in the heart of an individual that will sprout in Jehovah’s due time. (John 6: 44; 1 Cor. 3:6) None of us know how many more will yet come to learn of the Kingdom through the efforts of Jehovah’s people, either locally or worldwide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> As never before, we should heed Jesus’ instruction: “Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is. But what I say to you I say to all, Keep on the watch.” (Mark 13:33,37) So, then, may all of us keep on declaring the good news of the Kingdom, making Jehovah’s heart rejoice as we share in sanctifying his great and holy name.</span></p>

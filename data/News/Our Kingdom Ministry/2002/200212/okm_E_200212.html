<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">December 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 12/02 Vol. 45, No. 12</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclaim the Kingdom Message</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.” (Luke 4:43) With those words, Jesus identified the theme of his ministry—God’s Kingdom. The message we proclaim today also centers on the Kingdom, as foretold at Matthew 24:14: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” What truths about God’s Kingdom do people need to hear?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> God’s Kingdom now rules from the heavens and will soon replace all human rulership.</span><span class="font10"> The Devil has already been ousted from heaven, and the present wicked system of things has entered its last days. (Rev. 12:10, 12) Satan’s wicked old system will be completely destroyed, but God’s Kingdom will not be shaken. It will remain forever.—Dan. 2:44; Heb. 12:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> The Kingdom will satisfy the wholesome desires of all obedient humans.</span><span class="font10"> It will provide relief from suffering caused by war, crime, oppression, and poverty. (Ps. 46:8, 9; 72:12-14) An abundance of food will be available to all. (Ps. 72:16; Isa. 25:6) Illnesses and disabilities will be but a distant memory. (Isa. 33:24; 35: 5, 6) As mankind grows to perfection, the earth will be transformed into a paradise, and people will dwell together harmoniously.—Isa. 11:6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> We show that we want to be subjects of God’s Kingdom by the way we live now.</span><span class="font10"> The Kingdom message should influence our entire life course, including our goals and priorities. For example, while we have an obligation to provide for our household, we cannot allow material concerns to choke Kingdom interests. (Matt. 13:22; 1 Tim. 5:8) Rather, we must heed Jesus’ admonition: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things [life’s material necessities] will be added to you.” —Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It is urgent that people hear and act on the Kingdom message while there is yet time. May we help them to do so by “using persuasion concerning the kingdom of God.”—Acts 19:8.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember Faithful Older Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Although a widow and despite advancing age, 84-year-old Anna “was never missing from the temple.” Her faithfulness moved Jehovah to grant her a special blessing. (Luke 2:36-38) Today, many brothers and sisters display a spirit like that of Anna despite facing challenging circumstances. When such faithful ones must contend with health problems or limitations due to old age, they may at times feel discouraged. Let us consider some practical ways in which we can encourage them and help them maintain a good spiritual routine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Meetings and the Ministry: </span><span class="font10">When others lovingly offer to provide transportation, many faithful older ones can more easily attend Christian meetings regularly. This builds up these faithful, longtime servants spiritually and benefits the congregation as well. Have you had a share in this fine work?—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Participating regularly in the ministry brings true Christians joy and satisfaction. But doing so can be a challenge for the elderly and the infirm. Is it possible that one of these dear ones could accompany you as a “fellow worker” in some feature of the witnessing work? (Rom. 16:3, 9, 21) Perhaps you could invite him or her to share with you in telephone witnessing or to go with you on a return visit or a Bible study. If the older one is homebound, could a Bible student come to that one’s home for studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Study and Association: </span><span class="font10">From time to time, some invite an older or infirm one to attend their family study, even holding the study in that one’s home. One mother took her two young children to an older sister’s home for their study in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories,</span><span class="font10"> and all were encouraged by the association. Such individuals also appreciate being invited for a meal or some other social occasion. If infirm ones are too weak for an extended visit, perhaps you could call or stop by briefly to read to them, pray with them, or share an upbuilding experience. —Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah treasures faithful older ones. (Heb. 6:10, 11) We can imitate him by expressing our appreciation for them and by helping them to maintain a good spiritual routine.</span></p>

Signing, witnessing, and dating of cards may be done at the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study overseer.

If you have already executed a DPA, it will not be necessary to complete another one unless your current one is dated prior to 2001 (August 1,2001, for North Dakota) or does not express your present wishes. If you have moved to another state, you should execute a new DPA form for that state.

<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>2003 “Give God Glory” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">'Through his faithful prophet Isaiah, Jehovah commanded: “Pay attention to me, O my people; and you national group of mine, to me give ear.” (Isa. 51:4) In this increasingly critical time of the end, do we not agree that paying attention to Jehovah’s commands is more important than ever? One of the ways we “give ear” to Jehovah is by obeying his command to congregate for worship. How we look forward to the special opportunity that our annual district conventions afford! The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has again arranged for many district conventions to be held in the United States branch territory in 2003.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> As indicated in the July 1, 2002, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> international conventions will also be held in selected cities, with delegates attending from around the world. Since a limited number of cities will host the international conventions, only congregations assigned to those conventions will be able to attend. But the international aspect will be felt at all district conventions. Missionaries will be present at conventions in many locations, and there will be an opportunity to hear some of their experiences. What can we do to benefit fully from the arrangements now being made for our summer conventions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be in Attendance Every Day: </span><span class="font10">To benefit fully from the instruction provided through the faithful and discreet slave class, we want to make sure that we are there for the entire program. (Matt. 24:45) Do you need to ask your employer for time off to attend every day of the convention? Before Nehemiah asked King Artaxerxes for permission to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls, he “prayed to the God of the heavens.” (Neh. 2:4) You should likewise pray to Jehovah for courage to ask your employer for time off to attend all three days of the convention. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What if your employer is</span><span class="font10"> reluctant to let you have the time off? Perhaps explaining that the instruction we receive at our conventions helps us to be honest, diligent, and trustworthy workers may help him respond favorably. Additionally, if we have unbelieving family members, it would be loving to inform them of our convention plans as soon as possible.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Sunday 9:30 a.m. - 4:05 p.m.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use the Recommended Lodging List to Make Your Reservations: </span><span class="font10">The local Rooming Department has spent the past several months obtaining sufficient hotel rooms for the convention. Your congregation has now received a Recommended Lodging List, which will be posted on the information board after this insert is considered at the Service Meeting. Book study overseers may make a copy of the list for their group </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font10"> if the congregation has its two-day circuit assembly the week that the convention assignment letter is to be read. Even in such cases, however, copies of the Recommended Lodging List should not be made for individual publishers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Using the instructions in the box on page 4, be sure to make your reservations only from the hotels on the current list. Please do not call hotels not on the list and ask if they have a rate for the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In the past, some hotels have said that they had a rate for Jehovah’s Witnesses, even though these hotels were not on the list. The number permitted to occupy a room is indicated on the list under the heading “Adults,” with the maximum usually being four persons, including children. Please adhere to this requirement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> To guarantee your reservation, you must send a deposit to the hotel for each room reserved within ten days of making the reservation. Otherwise, the hotel can offer your room to someone else. If you send a deposit by check or money order, be sure to write on it your confirmation number.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If no rooms are available after calling </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font10"> the hotels on the list or if you have a problem with a hotel, inform your congregation secretary. He should contact your convention’s Rooming Department, using the telephone number at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. Rather than calling a hotel that is not on the list, wait for a revised list to be received for your convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Helping Those With Special Needs: </span><span class="font10">Are there some in your congregation who may need help in attending the convention? The special needs of the elderly, the infirm, or those in fulltime service are cared for mainly by their Christian relatives, but elders and others who are aware of the circumstances of such ones can also provide loving assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> The Congregation Service Committee will review all Special Needs Room Requests submitted by publishers. Using the guidelines outlined on the form, the service committee should determine whether each request is a special need that cannot be cared for locally. Such a provision is only for publishers in good standing, along with their well-behaved children. The Rooming Department will contact the congregation secretary if they have any questions regarding a special needs request.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font10">If circumstances require that you attend a convention other than the one to which you are assigned and you need to obtain a hotel room, please see your congregation secretary. He can provide you with the address of the convention headquarters, which is printed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Mail your request to the appropriate address, and include with it a self-addressed, stamped envelope. If there is more than one convention held in the city, be sure your request indicates the dates you wish to attend. The Rooming Department from that city will then send you the most recent Recommended Lodging List for the specified convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> We Are a Theatrical Spectacle: </span><span class="font10">Do people see the contrast between Jehovah’s Witnesses and those of this world? Absolutely! Note some comments from hotel managers in one city: “We’ve always had dealings with conventions, but you have been the most cooperative and kind.” “Last week we had another religious group with us. The difference between you and them is obvious.” “We know we can always count on your help and cooperation.” Do not such comments help us appreciate how the “wisdom from above” has a positive effect on our personality? (Jas. 3:17) Since we are “a theatrical spectacle to the world,” may our conduct at all times reflect the dignity and splendor of our God, Jehovah.—1 Cor. 4:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Since “the scene of this world is changing,” we need our district conventions to help us stay spiritually focused. (1 Cor. 7:31) Making arrangements to attend every day will require effort, but it is well worth it. This year’s “Give God Glory” District Convention has been prepared to help us remain steadfast as we await the execution of Jehovah’s judgment upon Satan’s world. May we let nothing prevent us from receiving the instruction Jehovah has prepared for us.—Isa. 51:4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">How well informed are you about the options that are available in the field of bloodless medicine? Do you understand what some of the transfusion alternatives are and how they work? Watch this video, and test your knowledge with the following questions. —Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with small children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(1) What is the main reason why Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions, and where is that principle found in the Bible? (2) When it comes to medical care, what do we desire? (3) What basic right do patients have? (4) Why is it rational and responsible to reject blood transfusions? (5) When severe blood loss occurs, what two urgent priorities do doctors have? (6) What health risks are associated with blood transfusions? (7) What are some of the tools that surgeons have available to them to minimize blood loss during surgery? (8) What should you want to be informed about regarding any transfusion alternative? (9) Can serious and complicated surgeries be performed without the use of blood transfusions?

<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Many Bible accounts include specific numbers, which help to convey a vivid picture of what took place. For example, Gideon vanquished the camp of Midian with just 300 men. (Judg. 7:7) Jehovah’s angel killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. (2 Ki. 19: 35) At Pentecost 33 C.E., about 3,000 were baptized, and shortly thereafter the number of believers grew to some 5,000. (Acts 2:41; 4:4) It is evident from these accounts that God’s ancient servants put forth much effort to compile a complete and accurate record.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s organization today instructs us to report our field service activity each month. Our faithfully cooperating with this arrangement contributes to the effective oversight of the preaching work. Reports may reveal that an aspect of the ministry needs attention or that more workers are needed in a certain part of the field. In the congregation, field service reports help the elders identify those with potential to expand their ministry as well as those who may need assistance. And reports on the progress of the Kingdompreaching work provide encouragement for the entire Christian brotherhood. Are you doing your part to contribute to an accurate report?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Your Personal Responsibility: </span><span class="font10">At the end of the month, do you find it difficult to remember what you have done in the ministry? If so, why not record your activity each time you share in field service? Some use a calendar or a diary. Others carry a blank field service report slip with them. At the end of the month, promptly submit your report to your book study overseer. Or, if you prefer, you may place your report in the report box at the Kingdom Hall. If you forget to turn in your report, promptly contact your book study overseer rather than wait for him to approach you. Conscientiously reporting your activity shows respect for Jehovah’s arrangement and loving consideration for the brothers assigned to collect and tabulate the reports—Luke 16:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Book Study Overseer’s Role: </span><span class="font10">As an alert and attentive shepherd, the book study overseer takes an interest in the group’s activity throughout the month. (Prov. 27:23) He knows whether each publisher is having a regular, meaningful, and joyful share and is quick to offer assistance if any have not participated for an entire month. A word of encouragement, a practical suggestion, or an invitation to accompany him in field service is often all that is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> At the end of the month, the book study overseer makes sure that all in the group have followed through on their responsibility to report their activity so that the secretary can submit an accurate congregation report to the branch office by the sixth of the next month. As the end of the month approaches, it may be helpful for him to give the group a reminder and have report slips available at the book study location. If any are forgetful about reporting their activity, he can provide appropriate reminders and encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Submitting our field service reports promptly contributes to a report that accurately reflects what was accomplished in the field. Will you do your part by promptly reporting your activity each month?</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Set Spiritual Goals</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">’What a privilege it will be to praise Jehovah throughout eternity! To help us realize that goal, we can set more immediate spiritual goals and work toward attaining them. This enables us to direct our energies wisely. (1 Cor. 9:26) What goals would be realistic for you?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Bible Study: </span><span class="font2">Do you prepare for each congregation meeting? If so, do you allow time for research and meditation when you study? For example, when preparing for the weekly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Study and Congregation Book Study, do you just underline answers or do you look up the cited scriptures and also ponder the reasons for the explanations given? Could you make it your goal to do research on a few points each week from the assigned Bible reading for the Theocratic Ministry School? Such spiritual digging takes time and effort, but it yields rich rewards.—Prov. 2:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font2">Another goal is to attend all five congregation meetings regularly. Arriving early enough to associate with fellow believers and to share in the opening song and prayer helps build up the spirit of the congregation. We might also strive to comment at each meeting and work at improving our comments. Perhaps you can show how a scripture in the paragraph bears on the discussion or point out how the material applies in everyday life. —Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Field Service: </span><span class="font2">Our ministry improves greatly when we set goals. Do you have a personal goal of hours that you plan to spend in service each month? Some find that helpful. Or could you improve in some aspect of your ministry, such as using the Bible in the house-to-house activity, making more meaningful return visits, striving to start a Bible study, or teaching more effectively on studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Parents, are you prompting your children to set goals in Jehovah’s service? Help them to see that serving as a pioneer, a missionary, or a member of the Bethel family is an excellent way to show the depth of their appreciation for Jehovah. —Eccl. 12:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> As we examine our activities, set spiritual goals, and then work at reaching them, we will find greater joy in our service and be a source of encouragement to others.—Rom. 1:12.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> While the media and secular educators glorify material wealth, God’s Word urges us to “Be Rich in Fine Works.” (1 Tim. 6:18) That is the theme of the special assembly day program beginning in September 2002. What encouragement will we receive at this assembly?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The circuit overseer will discuss what it means to “Be Rich From God’s Standpoint,” and he will interview some who are exerting themselves to acquire spiritual riches. In his first talk of the day, the visiting speaker will show how God’s people are performing “Fine Works in This Time of Harvest.” Each of us will be encouraged to consider how we might share even more fully in the God-ordained harvest work being accomplished today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> How proud we are when we see Christian youths pursuing spiritual riches! This glorifies Jehovah and helps youths to lay a fine foundation for future privileges of service. The part “Commending Youths for Fine Works in Praising Jehovah” will highlight fine works that young Christians locally have been performing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What are the results of pursuing fine works? The visiting speaker will discuss this in his final talk, “Continue in Fine Works and Reap Jehovah’s Blessings.” He will consider four areas in which we reap rich blessings: (1) as individuals, (2) as families, (3) as a congregation, and (4) as a worldwide organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Those who have made a dedication to Jehovah will have the opportunity to get baptized. If you are ready to take that step, let the presiding overseer know right away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> When the assembly date for your area is announced, be quick to make definite plans to be in attendance. Endeavor to arrive early so as to share in the opening song and prayer. Being present and attentive for the entire special assembly day program will strengthen us to continue pursuing a course that makes us truly rich from the standpoint of our God, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font14">What Holds Them Back? Audience discussion and demonstration. In our ministry we commonly encounter people who are reluctant to discuss their beliefs. This poses a barrier that can prevent us from sharing the Kingdom message. If we recognize why a person holds back, this may help us to formulate an approach that will draw the individual out. Dis-sentation when we encounter the following types of people: (1) Those apathetic toward religion, even their own. (2) Those with an emotional attachment to religious customs practiced by their family and ancestors. (3) Those who are uncomfortable talking about their beliefs because they have little Scriptural support for them. (4) Those prejudiced against us because of misleading comments made by opposers. Adjust list as needed to suit the local territory, focusing on attitudes commonly encountered. Include a brief demonstration showing how to draw a person into a Scriptural conversation.</span></p>

(2) Be sure to have sufficient house-to-house records and a pen or a pencil. (3) If you need transportation, make appropriate travel arrangements. (4) Think about the return visits you plan to make. (5) Prepare what you are going to say. If you will be conducting the meeting for field service, obtain sufficient territory.

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Display Christian Loyalty When a Relative Is Disfellowshipped</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The bond between family members can be very strong. This brings a test upon a Christian when a marriage mate, a child, a parent, or another close relative is disfellowshipped or has disassociated himself from the congregation. (Matt. 10:37) How should loyal Christians treat such a relative? Does it make a difference if the person lives in your household? First, let us review what the Bible says on this subject, the principles of which apply equally to those who are disfellowshipped and to those who disassociate themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How to Treat Expelled Ones: </span><span class="font2">God’s Word commands Christians not to keep company or fellowship with a person who has been expelled from the congregation: “Quit mixing in company with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anyone</span><span class="font2"> called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a re-viler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.. .. Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.” (1 Cor. 5:11,13) Jesus’ words recorded at Matthew 18:17 also bear on the matter: “Let [the expelled one] be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.” Jesus’ hearers well knew that the Jews of that day had no fraternization with Gentiles and that they shunned tax collectors as outcasts. Jesus was thus instructing his followers not to associate with expelled ones.—See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">of September 15, 1981, pages 18-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> This means that loyal Christians do not have spiritual fellowship with anyone who has been expelled from the congregation. But more is involved. God’s Word states that we should </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘not even eat with such a man.’</span><span class="font2"> (1 Cor. 5:11) Hence, we also avoid social fellowship with an expelled person. This would rule out joining him in a picnic, party, ball game, or trip to the mall or theater or sitting down to a meal with him either in the home or at a restaurant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What about speaking with a disfellowshipped person? While the Bible does not cover every possible situation, 2 John 10 helps us to get Jehovah’s view of matters: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never re-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What situation can test a Christian’s loyalty?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. According to the Bible, how are Christians to treat those expelled from the congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3, 4. What sort of fellowship with disfellowshipped and disassociated people is forbidden? </span><span class="font2">ceive him into your homes or say a greeting to him.” Commenting on this, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of September 15,1981, page 25, says: “A simple ‘Hello’ to someone can be the first step that develops into a conversation and maybe even a friendship. Would we want to take that first step with a disfellowshiped person?”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Indeed, it is just as page 31 of the same issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> states: “The fact is that when a Christian gives himself over to sin and has to be disfellowshiped, he forfeits much: his approved standing with God; . . . sweet fellowship with the brothers, including much of the association he had with Christian relatives.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> In the Immediate Household: </span><span class="font2">Does this mean that Christians living in the same household with a disfellowshipped family member are to avoid talking to, eating with, and associating with that one as they go about their daily activities? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of April 15, 1991, in the footnote on page 22, states: “If in a Christian’s household there is a disfellowshipped relative, that one would still be part of the normal, dayto-day household dealings and activities.” Thus, it would be left up to members of the family to decide on the extent to which the disfellowshipped family member would be included when eating or engaging in other household activities. And yet, they would not want to give brothers with whom they associate the impression that everything is the same as it was before the dis-fellowshipping occurred.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> However, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of September 15, 1981, page 28, points out regarding the disfellowshipped or disassociated person: “Former spiritual ties have been completely severed. This is true even with respect to his relatives, including those within his immediate family circle. . . . That will mean changes in the spiritual fellowship that may have existed in the home. For example, if the husband is disfellowshiped, his wife and children will not be comfortable with him conducting a family Bible study or leading in Bible reading and prayer. If he wants to say a</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">5. When disfellowshipped, what does a person forfeit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">6. Is a Christian required to cut off all association with a disfellowshipped relative living in the same household? Explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">7. How does spiritual fellowship within the home change when a family member is disfellowshipped? </span><span class="font2">prayer, such as at mealtime, he has a right to do so in his own home. But they can silently offer their own prayers to God. (Prov. 28:9; Ps. 119:145, 146) What if a disfellowshiped person in the home wants to be present when the family reads the Bible together or has a Bible study? The others might let him be present to listen if he will not try to teach them or share his religious ideas.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> If a minor child living in the home is disfel-lowshipped, Christian parents are still responsible for his upbringing. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of November 15,1988, page 20, states: “Just as they will continue to provide him with food, clothing, and shelter, they need to instruct and discipline him in line with God’s Word. (Proverbs 6:20-22; 29:17) Loving parents may thus arrange to have a home Bible study with him, even if he is disfellow-shipped. Maybe he will derive the most corrective benefit from their studying with him alone. Or they may decide that he can continue to share in the family study arrangement.”—See also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of October 1, 2001, pages 16-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Relatives Not in the Household: </span><span class="font2">“The situation is different if the disfellowshipped or disassociated one is a relative living outside the immediate family circle and home,” states </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of April 15, 1988, page 28. “It might be possible to have almost no contact at all with the relative. Even if there were some family matters requiring contact, this certainly would be kept to a minimum,” in harmony with the divine injunction to “quit mixing in company with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anyone”</span><span class="font2"> who is guilty of sinning unrepentantly. (1 Cor. 5:11) Loyal Christians should strive to avoid needless association with such a relative, even keeping business dealings to an absolute minimum.—See also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of September 15, 1981, pages 29-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> addresses another situation that can arise: “What if a close relative, such as a son or a parent who does not live in the home, is disfellowshiped and subsequently wants to move back there? The family could decide what to do depending on the situation. For example, a disfellowshiped parent may be sick or no longer able to care for himself financially or physically. The Christian children have a Scriptural</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">8. What responsibility do Christian parents have toward a minor disfellowshipped child living in the home?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">9. To what extent should a Christian have contact with a disfellowshipped relative living outside the home?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">10, 11. What will a Christian consider before allowing a disfellowshipped relative to move into the home?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">and moral obligation to assist. (1 Tim. 5:8) . . . What is done may depend on factors such as the parent’s true needs, his attitude and the regard the head of the household has for the spiritual welfare of the household.”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of September 15,1981, pages 28-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> As for a child, the same article continues: “Sometimes Christian parents have accepted back into the home for a time a disfellowshiped child who has become physically or emotionally ill. But in each case the parents can weigh the individual circumstances. Has a disfellowshiped son lived on his own, and is he now unable to do so? Or does he want to move back primarily because it would be an easier life? What about his morals and attitude? Will he bring ‘leaven’ into the home?—Gal. 5:9.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Benefits of Being Loyal to Jehovah: </span><span class="font2">Cooperating with the Scriptural arrangement to disfellowship and shun unrepentant wrongdoers is beneficial. It preserves the cleanness of the congregation and distinguishes us as upholders of the Bible’s high moral standards. (1 Pet. 1:1416) It protects us from corrupting influences. (Gal. 5:7-9) It also affords the wrongdoer an opportunity to benefit fully from the discipline received, which can help him to produce “peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.”—Heb. 12:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> After hearing a talk at a circuit assembly, a brother and his fleshly sister realized that they needed to make adjustments in the way they treated their mother, who lived elsewhere and who had been disfellowshipped for six years. Immediately after the assembly, the man called his mother, and after assuring her of their love, he explained that they could no longer talk to her unless there were important family matters requiring contact. Shortly thereafter, his mother began attending meetings and was eventually reinstated. Also, her unbelieving husband began studying and in time was baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> Loyally upholding the disfellowshipping arrangement outlined in the Scriptures demonstrates our love for Jehovah and provides an answer to the one that is taunting Him. (Prov. 27: 11) In turn, we can be assured of Jehovah’s blessing. King David wrote regarding Jehovah: “As for his statutes, I shall not turn aside from them. With someone loyal you will act in loyalty.”—2 Sam. 22:23, 26.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>What to Say About the Magazines</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> To carry out our commission to preach and make disciples, we must impart information to others. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) Communication can be a challenge even among friends. What can help us to reach strangers with the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> From Stranger to Friend: </span><span class="font2">Try to put yourself in the place of those you approach in the ministry. In today’s world, it is understandable that some might be suspicious, or even fearful, of strangers. This can stifle communication. How can you overcome the initial apprehension of those you meet? Before we ever say a word, one way we communicate is by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">our modest personal appearance.</span><span class="font2"> Our well-arranged dress and dignified bearing help to allay fears. —1 Tim. 2:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Another aid to communication is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a relaxed, friendly manner.</span><span class="font2"> This helps put others at ease and makes them more inclined to listen. Good preparation is necessary in this regard. When we have clearly in mind what we are going to say, we tend to be less nervous. And this peaceful frame of mind on our part can draw others to our message. One woman said this about the visit of a Witness: “What I remember about her smiling face was the peace. I was intrigued.” This opened the way for the woman to listen to the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Qualities That Attract: </span><span class="font2">We need to take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a sincere personal interest in others.</span><span class="font2"> (Phil. 2:4) One way to do this is by not dominating the conversation. After all, communication also involves listening. When we invite our listeners to express themselves and we listen with interest to their comments, they sense that we care about them. So when your listeners speak, do not be in a hurry to revert to your prepared presentation. Commend them if you can do so sincerely, and try to build on what they say. If their comments reveal something that is close to their heart, adapt your presentation to address their concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Modesty and lowliness of mind</span><span class="font2"> lubricate the gears of communication. (Prov. 11:2; Acts 20: 19) People were drawn to Jesus because he was “mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (Matt. 11:29) On the other hand, a superior attitude repels. Thus, although we are firmly convinced that we have the truth, we wisely avoid speaking in a dogmatic manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> What if the person’s comments reflect beliefs that are out of harmony with what the Bible teaches? Are we under obligation to correct him? Yes, in due course, but we do not have to try to do so on the initial call. Often it is advantageous to build on ideas we hold in common with our listener before sharing Bible teachings that he may find more difficult to accept. This requires </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patience and tact.</span><span class="font2"> Paul set a fine example in this regard when witnessing to the judges of the Areopagus. —Acts 17:18, 22-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Above all, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unselfish love</span><span class="font2"> will help us to be effective communicators. Like Jesus, we must feel pity for people who are “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) This moves us to bring them the good news and to help them get on the road to life. Ours is a message of love, so let us keep telling it in a loving way. By so doing, we imitate Jehovah God and Jesus Christ —the foremost Communicators in the universe.</span></p></li></ul>

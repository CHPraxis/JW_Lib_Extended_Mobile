<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Preaching Helps Save Lives!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">'It is the most important work going on in the world at this time. Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and myriads of angels have fixed their attention on it. What is it, and why is it essential? It is Kingdom preaching, and it helps save lives!—Rom. 1: 16; 10:13,14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Some people may feel that we could better serve others if we got involved in trying to improve the world around us. Many are consumed with efforts to attain peace, cure diseases, or improve the economy. But what will help people the most?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> An Excelling Work: </span><span class="font14">The Kingdom message alone explains the purpose of life, the cause of human suffering, and the only reliable hope for the future. The good news enables people to become friends of Jehovah and thus receive “the peace of God that excels all thought.” (Phil. 4:7) Only the Kingdom message provides practical guidance to help people to cope with life’s problems now and explains how to be preserved alive when the wicked world is destroyed in the future. (1 John 2:17) Is that not worth all the effort we can put into Kingdom preaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> To illustrate: What would be the best way to help a sleeping village that is imperiled by a dam that will soon burst? Bailing water from behind the weakening dam? Beautifying the doomed village? No! The villagers must be awakened, warned of the impending disaster, and helped to escape! Those who are spiritually asleep today are in grave danger. (Luke 21:34-36) Since this system of things will be passing away soon, let us endeavor to preach with utmost urgency to all we can!—2 Tim. 4:2; 2 Pet. 3:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Stick With It: </span><span class="font14">Let us look for ways to reach even more people who are sincere with the good news—at their homes, on the street, over the telephone, and informally. The work Jehovah has given us to do is the most important work we could possibly do. If we carry it out zealously, we ‘will save both ourselves and those who listen to us.’—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">An Enthusiastic Response!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Christian families everywhere have expressed their enthusiastic appreciation for the video </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask—How Can I Make Real Friends?</span><span class="font14"> A father in the United States said that after viewing it his sons sat silently—they could relate to everything in the video! A report from Malawi says that young brothers and sisters there could also relate to it because they experience the same pressures from their peers at school. A father in Germany said of the video: “I consider it an answer to my prayers.” A youth said: “Thank you for reminding me that Jehovah does care about me.” An elder in New Zealand reported: “It helped one of our teenagers get back on the road to life.” A married adult watched it and said: “How I wish every young person in the truth would see this video and be moved to make the truth his own!” Families, why not watch it again? Afterward, discuss together the following questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Introduction: </span><span class="font14">What is a true friend?—Prov. 18:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Roadblocks to Friendship: </span><span class="font14">How can you overcome the feeling of being left out? (Phil. 2:4) Why must you be willing to improve your personality, and who can help you to do that? What will open up opportunities to make more friends, and where can they be found?—2 Cor. 6:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Friendship With God: </span><span class="font14">How can you develop a relationship with Jehovah, and why is it worth the effort? (Ps. 34:8) Who can best strengthen your friendship with God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> The Wrong Kind of Friends: </span><span class="font14">Who are bad associates? (1 Cor. 15:33) How can the wrong friends lead one into spiritual ruin? What does the Bible account about Dinah teach you?—Gen. 34:1, 2, 7,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> A Modern-Day Drama: </span><span class="font14">How did loneliness affect Tara? How did she justify her association with worldly youths? To what dangers did they expose her? Why did her parents fail to see the danger she was in, but with what attitude did they help her to recover spiritually? How did a pioneer sister prove to be a real friend to Tara? Why must Christians heed Proverbs 13:20 and Jeremiah 17:9? What important lesson did Tara learn?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Conclusion: </span><span class="font14">What lessons have you learned from this video? How can you use it to help others?—Ps. 71:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Pioneers Keep Assisting Others. Service overseer holds a panel discussion with a Congregation Book Study overseer, a pioneer, and a publisher. The service overseer reviews the Pioneers Assist Others program as outlined in the September 1998 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font13">page 4.

The service overseer invites all publishers to let him know if they want to receive assistance in the ministry. Those who were assisted in the past may be included again to receive further help in another feature of the ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Be on Time! A talk. Activities associated with our worship and service are important affairs, calling for “an appointed time.” (Eccl. 3:1) We want to derive the fullest benefit from theocratic provisions. Congregation meetings and meetings for service should begin promptly at the designated times. Jehovah is never late in carrying out his activities. (Hab. 2:3) Do we need to improve in this regard? Occasionally, individuals may be unavoidably delayed. But with good organization, we need not be habitually late, arriving after the opening song and prayer of a meeting or after field service arrangements have already been made. Discuss practical ways to cultivate better habits that will ensure our being prompt for all spiritual activities—See June 15, 1990, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> page 29.</span></p>

Questions often arise in the ministry i- about topics that are not listed under “Principal Subjects” (pages 5-6) in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. The “Index” (pages 439-45) is very useful in locating Scriptural support for our beliefs. Invite audience to participate in finding answers to the following questions by looking in the index under each italicized word: What is a Christian’s view of national </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">anthems</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">flags?</span><span class="font13"> Why does God permit </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">disasters?</span><span class="font13"> How can you explain the Bible’s view of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">divorce?</span><span class="font13"> Why and when do sisters sometimes need to wear a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">head covering?</span><span class="font13"> What is the origin of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Mother’s Day?</span><span class="font13"> How do we know that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">144,000</span><span class="font13"> is a literal number in the Bible?

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font13">Planning Ahead for Summer. Talk and audience discussion. Outline activities usually planned for summer: attending the entire district convention, auxiliary pioneering one or more months, making improvements around the house, and perhaps enjoying a vacation or some recreation. Invite a few to relate their summer plans and how they will make sure that they do not neglect their family study, congregation meetings, and field service, even if traveling elsewhere. If the congregation has seldom-worked territory, announce what arrangements are being made for thorough coverage. Remind all to make sure that the Congregation Book Study overseer receives their field service reports, regardless of whether they are at home or away.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>“Work What Is Good Toward All”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Preach the Word of God Fully” and “Be Rich in Fine Works” were the themes used in the February and March 2002 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> inserts. (Col. 1:25; 1 Tim. 6:18) In those issues we were encouraged to put forth extra effort to help interested ones attend the Memorial, to help inactive ones become involved again in the congregation, and to help our children and qualified Bible students to begin publishing the good news. No doubt we have enjoyed some success as a result of our good efforts. Now, “as long as we have time favorable for it, let us [continue to] work what is good toward all.”—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Invite Them to Attend Again: </span><span class="font14">In the United States branch territory, over a million people who are not publishers of the good news attend the Memorial each year. Since their presence indicates a measure of interest, what must we do to stimulate those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life” to become “believers”? (Acts 13: 48) Encourage them to return to the congregation meetings as soon as possible.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Why not invite an interested person to attend the Congregation Book Study to enjoy an interesting discussion of Isaiah’s prophecy? If you are a relative or an acquaintance of the person and you are scheduled to give an upcoming talk on the Theocratic Ministry School, you might invite that one to come and hear your part. Keep him informed of the titles of the public talks that are to be given in the weeks ahead. (An up-to-date schedule should be posted on the information board.) Look for any opportunity to awaken in the person a desire to worship Jehovah. And of course, if he is not already studying the Bible with someone in the congregation, you can kindly offer him a study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Keep Encouraging the Inactive: </span><span class="font14">A number of those who attend the Memorial have already made a dedication to Jehovah. However, at some point they stopped actively preaching the good news. And yet, Paul exhorted us to “work what is good ... especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) Hence, the inactive ones should be of prime concern.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Perhaps some have already responded to the encouragement from the elders and others to get involved once again in the ministry. If you are assigned by the elders to work with a reactivated publisher, know that your own love for Jehovah and for the field ministry will build confidence in that one. Show him how you engage in the various features of the ministry so that he can find joy in it, will stick with the preaching work, and may experience Jehovah’s blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Give New Publishers a Good Start: </span><span class="font14">When a newly interested woman realized that she had found God’s true organization, she wanted to start in the service right away. After learning what was required of her, she said: “Let’s get busy with it.” If someone with whom you have been studying the Bible is now approved to begin sharing in field service, help him see the need to “get busy with it,” and so get the new publisher off to a good start. Help him develop a routine of preparing for and sharing regularly in the field ministry each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> If it is your own child who has become a new unbaptized publisher, work with him to make</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">progress according to his age and ability. With a little help from you, he may surprise you with how well he can engage someone in conversation, read from the Bible, and offer literature. When he has a good call in the field service, train him to make a return visit and follow up the interest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Expand Your Own Ministry: </span><span class="font14">Do your circumstances allow you to increase your share in the evangelizing work even beyond the Memorial season? Could you add an hour or two each week to what you usually spend in the service? Are you looking ahead on the calendar to when you can auxiliary pioneer again? Or can you arrange your life-style to enter the full-time ministry? All the effort we put forth in the ministry may help someone to accept the truth! (Acts 8: 26-39) As we look to the days ahead, let us “always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.”—1 Thess. 5:15.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>The Joys of Full-Time Service</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>x</sup>As a young person, you have no doubt given some thought to your future. Proverbs 21:5 tells us that “the plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” It will be to your advantage to give serious thought to your goals in life. As you make your plans for the future, consider taking up the full-time service. Why?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Ask some adults who pioneered during their younger years what their impressions are and invariably they will say the same thing: “Those were the best years of my life!” A brother who experienced the joys of full-time service from his young manhood on said in later life: “It is a source of deep satisfaction to look back on the time of youth and be able to say that one has heeded the wise counsel: ‘Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.’ ” (Eccl. 12:1) It takes good planning now, by both you and your parents, to work out a way for you to experience this kind of joy in your young manhood or young womanhood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Parents, Encourage Full-Time Service: </span><span class="font14">Jehovah, as a caring Father, shows you exactly which way to go. (Isa. 30:21) In providing such loving guidance, he sets a fine example for you as Christian parents. Instead of leaving it up to your children to choose which way is best for them, wisely train them in the way that they should go so that they will have Jehovah’s blessing. Then, when they grow older, your training will help them “distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) Adults know from experience that they cannot trust their own judgment; they must rely on Jehovah to make their paths straight. (Prov. 3:5, 6) This need is even greater for youths, who are less experienced in life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Parents, as your children approach the teen years, or even earlier, talk to them realistically about their career goals. School counselors, teachers, and classmates will try to influence them in favor of worldly, materialistic pursuits. Help your children to choose school courses that provide practical training, equipping them to care for their material needs without sacrificing Kingdom interests. (1 Tim. 6:6-11) In many cases, a high school education along with vocational and/or on-the-job training may be all that is needed to care adequately for one’s necessities while starting out in the regular pioneer ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Encourage youths to pursue the gift of singleness. If they later decide to marry, they will be in a better position to assume the heavier responsibilities of marriage. (See paragraph 19 in the June 2001 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> insert, “Can You Make Yourself Available?”) By speaking in a positive way about pioneering, serving where the need is greater, Bethel service, and missionary activity, instill in young people even at an early age a desire to use their lives in a way that pleases Jehovah, benefits others, and brings joy to themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Youths, Put Full-Time Service First: </span><span class="font14">Young people, you need not wonder what the pioneer work is like. You can try it on a parttime basis by auxiliary pioneering whenever possible throughout the school year and during vacation periods. Then you will know how satisfying the pioneer service really is! Can you see your way clear to auxiliary pioneer between now and the end of summer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> If you are a young brother in God’s organization, also think seriously about reaching out to qualify as a ministerial servant. (1 Tim. 3:810, 12) Additionally, decide whether you want to apply for Bethel service or to attend the Ministerial Training School, once you reach the qualifying age. Your experience in the pioneer ministry will teach you valuable lessons, such as how to live by a schedule, how to improve your personal organization, how to get along with others, and how to develop a sense of responsibility.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> A key factor in succeeding in full-time service is having a spirit of theocratic industriousness. The apostle Paul encouraged such an attitude, and he pointed out the blessings that would result: “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah, ... for you know that it is from Jehovah you will receive the due reward.” (Col. 3:23, 24) May Jehovah bless you with many joys in the full-time service!</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Spiritually Strong Families—How?</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Christian families are commended for ‘practicing godly devotion in their own households.’ (1 Tim. 5:4) However, with so many bad influences around us that can weaken our faith, it is vital that families work hard to remain spiritually strong. How can this be accomplished?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Exercise Christlike Headship: </span><span class="font14">Family heads need to imitate Jesus Christ in the way they shoulder their responsibility to strengthen their households. More than giving a onetime demonstration of his love for us through his sacrificial death, Jesus continually “feeds and cherishes” the congregation. (Eph. 5:2529) Loving parents follow this example of tender care by seeing to the day-to-day spiritual needs of their families. This includes holding a family Bible study each week, having rich spiritual discussions whenever possible, and addressing problems as they arise.—Deut. 6: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> In the Field Ministry: </span><span class="font14">All family members should appreciate that witnessing to others about Jehovah and his purposes is an important part of their worship. (Isa. 43:10-12) If you parents want your children to be faithful Witnesses of Jehovah, you must start very early in preparing their heart for the ministry. Discuss the reasons why there is a need to be self-sacrificing in the service and to engage in it each week. (Matt. 22:37-39) Then make arrangements for them to share regularly with you in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Build appreciation for the preaching work by setting aside time during the weekly family study to prepare and rehearse an effective presentation. Give your children individualized training in the ministry, helping them to make advancement according to their age and ability. After spending time together in service, discuss how they saw Jehovah’s goodness firsthand. Relate faith-strengthening experiences. The more that families “have tasted that the Lord is kind,” the closer they will be to Jehovah, fortifying them to resist “all badness.”—1 Pet. 2: 1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> At the Meetings: </span><span class="font14">How fine it is when family members help one another to attend all congregation meetings, especially if one of them is feeling tired, discouraged, or overwhelmed! “When my father comes home from work, he is tired,” remarked one young sister. “But I share with him a good point that will be talked about at the meeting that evening, and it encourages him to go. Then when I feel tired, he encourages me to go.”—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Doing Things Together: </span><span class="font14">Families should do things together, such as helping with household duties. Time should also be set aside for well-chosen recreation. Picnicking, hiking, playing games, and traveling to visit relatives or friends can provide happy moments and fond memories to look back on.—Eccl. 3:4.</span></p></li>

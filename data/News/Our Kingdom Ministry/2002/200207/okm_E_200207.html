<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gathering People Out of All Languages</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word is being fulfilled! People “out of all the languages of the nations” are embracing true worship. (Zech. 8:23) How are Jehovah’s Witnesses helping individuals of all ‘tribes, peoples, and tongues’ to come into a clean standing before Jehovah, with the prospect of surviving “the great tribulation”?—Rev. 7:9,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> God’s Organization Responds: </span><span class="font11">The Governing Body has arranged for Bible literature to be made available in some 380 languages so that people in all the earth can understand clearly the import of the good news. Preparing and publishing literature in so many languages is a vast undertaking. It involves assembling teams of qualified translators and providing them with the support they need to translate our literature into all these languages, as well as printing and shipping the material. The key role, however, is played by the individual Kingdom publishers, who bring the Bible’s lifesaving message to the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Accepting the Challenge: </span><span class="font11">Sizable foreign-language populations are now found in many places. To reach these people with the good news, more and more of God’s servants are endeavoring to learn Chinese, Russian, Spanish, or some other language common in their area. Others are learning American Sign Language. In the United States alone, there are some 2,900 congregations and 240 groups preaching in 38 languages other than English. Some who never heard of Jehovah or knew nothing about the Bible are accepting the truth of God’s Word.—Rom. 15:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Could we exert ourselves more fully in declaring the good news to people in our territory who are from another culture? (Col. 1:25) Many congregations are organizing the preaching work in the local foreign community. Publishers first learn enough of the language to give a simple presentation, such as: “Hello. Here is good news for you. [Then offer a tract or brochure available in that language.] Good-bye.” Jehovah is truly blessing such small beginnings!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The Kingdom message appeals to people of all backgrounds and languages. Let us seize the opportunity to share it with them.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>J</sup>To stand firm in the faith in an unstable world, we must trust in Jehovah. What does this mean in practical terms? How does trusting in Jehovah affect our personal and family life? How does it help us resist the influence of Satan’s world? The circuit assembly program for the 2003 service year answers these questions. Its theme is “Trust in Jehovah and Do Good.”—Ps. 37:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Our trust in Jehovah is not reserved for special occasions or times of dire need. It permeates our daily lives. This is emphasized in the opening talk, “Trust in Jehovah at All Times.” (Ps. 62:8) The four-part symposium “Manifesting Trust in Jehovah” will show us how to find and apply Bible-based information that can help us to build a successful marriage, to handle problems that arise in the family circle, and to meet our material needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Satan’s world tries to foist on us a twisted view of what is right and wrong and cause confusion as to what is important and unimportant. (Isa. 5:20) The talks “Guard Against the Vanities of Life” and “Shun the Bad —Be Doers of Good” will reinforce our resolve to uphold Jehovah’s lofty standards.—Amos 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When Jehovah brings an end to the present wicked system of things, God’s servants will need to trust in him fully. This is highlighted in the public address, “Deliverance From World Distress Is Near.” After that, we will be invited to examine ourselves in the part “Will You Be Counted Worthy of the Kingdom of God?” The program concludes with an exhortation to “Trust in Jehovah’s Promises.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A highlight of every assembly is the baptism talk. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements can be made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> In these uncertain times, Jehovah is the only real source of confidence and stability. (Ps. 118:8, 9) May all of us strengthen our trust in him by being present for the entire circuit assembly program.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">Good Reasons to Use the Bible in Our Ministry. Talk and audience discussion. Jesus knew the Scriptures and referred to them liberally when teaching. (Luke 24:27, 44-47) What he taught was not of his own originality. (John 7:16-18) It is important that we too use God’s Word. It has more power than anything we might personally say. (John 12: 49, 50; Heb. 4:12) Sincere ones are drawn by the comfort and hope the Scriptures offer. Make it your goal to read at least one Bible text in your presentations. Point out that scriptures are incorporated in this month’s suggested magazine presentations. Entertain some comments from the audience on how they have been using the Bible in the ministry and the effect this has had on themselves and on those to whom they preached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font11">How Can I Avoid Dangers on the Internet?

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">■ What should we bear in mind when using cellular telephones and electronic pagers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Such devices can enable us to contact others nearly any place we might be. While this may be useful, we must be careful not to allow the use of cell phones and pagers at inappropriate times to detract from our ministry or Christian meetings. How could this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider the effect it would have if our cell phone rang or our pager beeped while we were engaging in the held ministry giving a witness. What would the householder think? What impression might we leave if we stopped to answer the call? We would certainly not want to do anything to hinder others from listening to the Kingdom message. (2 Cor. 6:3) Hence, if we are carrying a cell phone or a pager, we should set it so that it does not interrupt us or others while we are engaging in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What about when we are waiting while others are giving a witness? If we have set aside a period of time for field service, should we not keep our minds on that activity? Out of respect for our sacred service, please care for unnecessary personal business or social interests at another time. (Rom. 12:7) This would not, of course, rule out using a phone to give a further witness or to make an appointment to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We must be especially cautious about using cell phones while driving, since some studies show that doing so greatly increases the risk of having an accident. We should strictly observe any laws that restrict the use of cell phones while driving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We come to Christian meetings, assemblies, and conventions to worship Jehovah and be taught by him. Should not appreciation for the sacredness of these occasions move us to set cell phones and pagers so that they do not distract us or others? If there is an urgent matter requiring our immediate attention, we should attend to it outside the place of meeting. Otherwise, we should arrange to care for personal and secular matters at times other than those designated for worship.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">May the way we use cellular phones or any other electronic equipment always show consideration for others and deep appreciation for spiritual things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Harmoniously Joined Together</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How often have you marveled at the masterful design of the human body? (Ps. 139:14) Each member of the body works in concert with the others. God’s Word likens the Christian congregation to a well-coordinated body. Under the Head, Christ, all the members of the congregation are ‘harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed.’ (Eph. 4: 16a) Thus, Jehovah is able to use his united people to accomplish wonderful things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Members of the first-century congregation acted “with one accord” in caring for one another’s spiritual and material needs. (Acts 2:44-47) With Jehovah’s backing, they unitedly faced and overcame fierce opposition. (Acts 4:24-31) They declared the Kingdom message wherever they went, covering the then-known earth with the good news. (Col. 1:23) In modern times, the Christian congregation has unitedly accomplished these same things on an even larger scale. What factors contribute to this oneness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Drawn Together by Divine Teaching: </span><span class="font11">Around the globe, we are united by our worship. How is this possible? We recognize Jehovah’s visible channel for providing spiritual “food at the proper time.” (Matt. 24: 45) We also appreciate the “gifts in men” he has given as teachers in the congregation. As we humbly accept Jehovah’s provisions to feed us spiritually, our understanding of God’s Word grows and stirs within us a common desire to imitate Jesus as his disciples. We must go on studying God’s Word, earnestly endeavoring to “attain to the oneness in the faith.” (Eph. 4:8, 11-13) Are you contributing to our spiritual unity by reading the Bible daily?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> United by Christian Association: </span><span class="font11">Love draws us together in close association at Christian meetings. At these meetings, we “consider one another.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) This involves looking beyond outward appearances and really getting to know our brothers, seeing them the way Jehovah sees them, as precious. (Hag. 2:7, ftn.) As we listen to their expressions of faith, our love for them deepens and our unity is strengthened. Are you known as one who regularly attends the congregation meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Fellow Workers in the Field: </span><span class="font11">Preaching the good news with fellow believers unites us in doing God’s will. The apostle Paul appreciated his “fellow workers for the kingdom of God.” (Col. 4: 11) Sharing experiences and assisting one another while in the ministry helps us to accomplish our Christian commission and strengthens our bond of unity. —Col. 3:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Unifying Influence of Holy Spirit: </span><span class="font11">As we apply ourselves to doing his will, Jehovah blesses us with his spirit. This helps us to smooth over differences and dwell together in unity. (Ps. 133:1) It motivates us “to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” (Eph. 4:3) Each of us can contribute to the harmony that exists among God’s people by manifesting the fruitage of the spirit in our dealings with one another.—Gal. 5:22, 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Serving together unitedly under Christ’s headship “makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.” (Eph. 4:16b) Moreover, it glorifies Jehovah, “the God who gives peace.”—Rom. 16:20.</span></p>

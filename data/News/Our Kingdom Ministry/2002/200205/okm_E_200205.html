<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Faith Moves Us to Good Works</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Faith caused Noah, Moses, and Rahab to act. Noah built the ark. Moses forsook the temporary advantages of life in Pharaoh’s court. Rahab hid the spies and then obeyed their instructions, saving her household. (Heb. 11:7, 24-26, 31) What good works does our faith move us to produce today?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Witnessing: </span><span class="font12">Faith moves us to speak about our wonderful God and his provisions for eternal happiness. (2 Cor. 4: 13) At times, we may feel hesitant to give a witness. But when we ‘place Jehovah in front of us constantly,’ we are strengthened and fear subsides. (Ps. 16:8) Then our faith impels us to share the good news with relatives, neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and others on every appropriate occasion.—Rom. 1:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Meeting Together: </span><span class="font12">Regular meeting attendance is another good work that springs from faith. How so? It shows our conviction that Jesus is present with us by means of God’s holy spirit when we gather at Christian meetings. (Matt. 18:20) It manifests our desire to “hear what the spirit says to the congregations.” (Rev. 3:6) We take seriously the instruction that we receive because our eyes of faith perceive that the one teaching us is our Grand Instructor, Jehovah.—Isa. 30:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> The Choices We Make: </span><span class="font12">Strong conviction of unseen realities moves us to give spiritual matters priority in our lives. (Heb. 11:1) This often involves making material sacrifices. For example, an elder turned down a lucrative secular opportunity because it would have meant missing meetings, being away from his family, and relinquishing his pioneer ministry. May we likewise place our full confidence in the Bible’s assurance that Jehovah will provide for those who “keep on . . . seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.”—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The powerful influence that faith exerts on our lives does not go unnoticed by others. Indeed, our faith is known earth wide. (Rom. 1:8) May all of us, therefore, demonstrate by our good works that our faith is alive. —Jas. 2:26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Using the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Brochure to Start Studies?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Did you realize that if you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, with an interested person and cover material in one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study? Yes, this is true even if the study takes place on the doorstep or over the telephone. Why not make a special effort during May and June to start such a study using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare for Success: </span><span class="font12">When offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure, have clearly in mind what you want to discuss. If you are making a return visit, think about the conversation you had on the initial call. Ask yourself: ‘Which paragraphs in the brochure can I feature to build on that discussion and lead into a Bible study?’ If you are calling from house to house, consider what subjects will appeal to a teenager, an older person, a man, or a woman. Review the brochure’s topics, and identify a subject of interest. After deciding on an approach, practice several times. This is one of the keys to success.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The January 2002 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> insert gives eight “Suggestions for Presenting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> Brochure.” The box “The Direct Approach” shows how to use the brochure to start studies. You might adapt the first suggestion as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Did you know that in just a few minutes, you can find the answer to an important Bible question? For example, why are there so many religions that claim to be Christian? Have you ever wondered about that?” After the person responds, turn to lesson 13 and discuss the first two paragraphs. As time permits, read and discuss a scripture or two. Then read the last question at the top of the page, and say: “The rest of the lesson highlights five identifying marks of true religion. I would be happy to return and consider these with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Persistent: </span><span class="font12">Take advantage of every opportunity to demonstrate a Bible study in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure. Ask for Jehovah’s blessing. (Matt. 21:22) By persisting in your efforts, you may taste the joy of helping someone to respond to the good news!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">note: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat pointed counsel from this month’s insert that applies locally. During the month of October, an entire Service Meeting will be arranged to review highlights of the convention program. In preparation for that discussion, all of us can take meaningful notes at the convention, including a list of specific points that we wish to apply personally in our own life and in the field ministry. Then we can explain how we have applied those suggestions since attending the convention. It will be mutually upbuilding to hear one another tell how they benefited from the good instruction that was received.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A Special Interchange of Encouragement</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Not a day passes without Jehovah’s people facing tests of their faith. Knowing he has a short period of time, the Devil is making a final onslaught to break our integrity to Jehovah. (Rev. 12:12) It is vital that we “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength” so that we “may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after [we] have done all things thoroughly, to stand firm.” —Eph. 6:10, 13.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan to Attend All Three Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Ask for time off from work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Reserve lodging at the convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Arrange transportation to the convention.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Gathering with fellow believers is a provision from Jehovah to help us acquire power. The apostle Paul appreciated this. He longed to be in the company of his Christian brothers so that they could “be encouraged together” and “be made firm.” (Rom. 1:11, 12, ftn.) To fortify us in doing God’s will, the Governing Body has lovingly arranged to give us the opportunity to benefit from an interchange of encouragement at the upcoming “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be There to Benefit: </span><span class="font0">Make it your goal to be present for all three days. We ‘benefit ourselves’ by arriving before the first song and remaining through our heartfelt “Amen” at the closing prayer. (Isa. 48: 17, 18) Many will need to arrange their work schedule well in advance so that they have the time available to attend all three days. Granted, it may not be easy to get your employer to give you the time off, but we have Jehovah’s assurance that he will help us to do his will. (1 John 5:14,15) If we have not done so already, now is the time to make definite arrangements for transportation and lodging, not leaving anything to chance. We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our efforts to attend all three days.—Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Anticipate the Encouragement: </span><span class="font0">Have you ever left a district convention, saying: “That was the best one ever!” Why might you have felt that way? It is because as imperfect humans we can gradually become worn down, finding ourselves in need of spiritual encouragement. (Isa. 40:30) One sister observed: “This system wears me down, and the conventions refocus my spiritual outlook, giving me the spiritual boost that I need. It seems as if the encouragement comes at just the time I need it the most.” Likely you have experienced similar feelings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> We receive needed encouragement not only by way of talks and interviews but also through other rich features of our conventions. One brother commented: “It is the clear, practical application of Bible principles that I really appreciate. Of course, the dramas are invaluable in showing how we can benefit from past examples, both good and bad. The releases are something I always look forward to, and I enjoy them long after returning home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Conventions are a vital provision from Jehovah during these “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) They help us heed the inspired counsel: “Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty.” (1 Cor. 16:13) Therefore, let us be determined to attend every session and enjoy a rich interchange of encouragement at our “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Convention!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Always Pursue What Is Good”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> The Christian way of life involves ‘always pursuing what is good toward all people.’ (1 Thess. 5:15) When attending our district conventions, we have many opportunities to do something good for others. On those occasions, we are in the public eye, and all who come in contact with us form opinions about us based on the way we treat them. To preserve a fine reputation as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we need to show by our actions that we “honor men of all sorts.” (1 Pet. 2: 17) That includes “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just [our] own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.” (Phil. 2:4) Consider how this applies to the convention rooming arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Have you made your hotel reservations yet? (1) Since the hotel wants to fill all available rooms, do not reserve more rooms than you plan to use. (2) Do not expect the hotel to save your room unless you make the appropriate deposit in advance of your arrival. (3) When you check in at the hotel, display patience and respect toward the hotel staff as they endeavor to accommodate you. (4) If a complimentary breakfast is included, do not abuse this provision, which is made for hotel guests only. (5) Abide by all the hotel’s rules regarding the use of its premises. (6) Leave a customary tip for the housekeeper.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Teaching Children How to Do Good: </span><span class="font0">On occasion, children who have been left without proper adult direction at hotels have caused problems. (Prov. 29:15) In some cases, parents were involved in other activities and left their children unsupervised in the room, at the swimming pool, or elsewhere in the hotel. Some children became so rowdy that the management found it necessary to restrict them from using certain facilities or had to close the pool or other recreational areas altogether. This disturbed and inconvenienced other hotel guests, both Witnesses and non-Witnesses.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Remember:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Be patient and respectful toward the hotel staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Observe hotel rules, to the benefit of all guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Do not abuse complimentary breakfast provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Properly monitor the actions of your children.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> Parents, prior to the convention, it would be helpful if you spend some time reviewing with your children the kind of Christian behavior that is expected of them at all times and in all places. (Eph. 6:4) For example, point out to them that genuine Christian love “does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked.” (1 Cor. 13:5) Adults can reinforce these words by setting the right example for all to see. Children, you can pursue what is good by obeying your parents, showing respect for hotel property, and being considerate of those around you. (Col. 3:20) As we unitedly strive to do good toward all, we “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Our fine conduct has a positive effect not only on observers in general but also on those who have been critical of us for one reason or another. In everything we do at the convention and throughout the convention city—whether walking on the street, eating in a restaurant, relaxing at the hotel, or taking advantage of opportunities to give an informal witness—our Christian speech and actions should prove that we want to pursue what is good.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Satisfy Your Spiritual Need</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Our upcoming “Zealous Kingdom Pro-claimers” District Convention affords us a wonderful opportunity to satisfy our spiritual need. Like a wholesome physical meal, the program promises to nourish us spiritually “with the words of the faith.” (1 Tim. 4:6) It will enable us to draw closer to Jehovah. And we can expect to receive counsel and encouragement to help us cope with trials in our lives. Jehovah assures us: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you.” (Ps. 32:8) How blessed we are to have his loving guidance in our lives! Consider some practical steps we can take to get the most benefit from the convention program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> We Need to Prepare Our Heart: </span><span class="font0">Each of us has a responsibility to safeguard his own figurative heart. (Prov. 4:23) This requires that we exercise self-discipline and that we be honest with ourselves. The convention is a time to meditate on our relationship with Jehovah, a time to ‘peer into the perfect law that belongs to freedom.’ To prepare our heart to ‘accept the implanting of the word,’ we should beseech Jehovah to search us through, to identify in us any “painful way” needing correction, and to lead us in “the way of time indefinite.” —Jas. 1:21, 25; Ps. 139:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Listen and Meditate: </span><span class="font0">Jesus commended Mary for paying rapt attention to his words, saying: “Mary chose the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.” (Luke 10:39, 42) If we have the same mental disposition, we will not allow trivial matters to distract us. We will make sure that we are seated and attentive during the entire program. We will avoid talking or walking about unnecessarily and will be careful not to distract others with cellular phones, pagers, cameras, and camcorders.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meditate on What You Hear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ How does it affect my relationship with Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ How does it influence my dealings with others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ How can I apply it in my life and in my ministry?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> When we listen to the talks, it is good to take </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font0"> notes to help us analyze how the subject is being developed. We should connect what we hear with what we already know. This will help us to grasp and retain the material. When reviewing our notes, we need to do so with a view to applying the material. Each one of us can well ask: ‘How does this affect my relationship with Jehovah? What adjustments do I need to make in my life? How can I apply this information in my dealings with others? How can I use it in my ministry?’ Discuss with others the points that we especially appreciate. Doing these things will aid us in keeping Jehovah’s sayings ‘in the midst of our heart.’—Prov. 4: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Let Us Apply What We Learn: </span><span class="font0">After attending a district convention, one delegate said: “The program was of a very personal nature, motivating one to examine his heart condition and that of his family, and to provide loving Scriptural help as needed. It has made me more aware of my obligation to give more assistance to the congregation.” Likely many of us have felt the same way. But it is not enough for us simply to go away feeling upbuilt and refreshed. Jesus said: “If you know these things, happy you are if you </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font0"> them.” (John 13:17) We must diligently put into practice the points that apply to us personally. (Phil. 4:9) This is the key to fully satisfying our spiritual need.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Modesty in Dress and Grooming</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “All the men, even young boys, wear ties. All the women and girls, both adolescents and little ones, wear either a dress or a skirt. There is not a pair of jeans or an opened collar to be seen. Everyone here is radiant.” So said a news report. What sort of crowd was it describing? A political rally? A sporting event? A rock concert? Far from it! It was describing a group of brothers and sisters at a large district convention last summer.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Glorify Jehovah:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Dress in a manner that befits a minister of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Avoid styles that follow the spirit of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Demonstrate modesty, which reflects soundness of mind.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> At another convention city, a newspaper reporter gave this description of the crowd of Witnesses: “All men are clean and wear suit and tie. The women dress modestly but with elegance.” A second observer, a security guard, stated: “You are well-behaved, respectful, clean, and tidy people. What I see is beautiful. In this filthy world, you managed to move aside the dirt!” What fine testimonials in our behalf! Are we not thankful that our brotherhood could be so well spoken of? Of course, all in the crowd contributed to the good reports by their exemplary appearance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> We have become known worldwide for being distinctly different in our appearance. (Mal. 3:18) Why? Because we follow the Scriptural admonition to “adorn [ourselves] in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, ... in the way that befits [those] professing to reverence God.” —1 Tim. 2:9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What Do You Indicate by Your Dress and Grooming? </span><span class="font0">The clothing that we wear and the way that we wear it make a definite statement about us—our beliefs, attitude, and intentions. The styles that we choose state who we are and what we stand for. We must never promote the debased thinking and conduct that is popularized by the world. Our concern is not whether a certain style is extremely fashionable but whether it is appropriate for one professing to be a minister of God. (Rom. 12:2) Rather than choose a look that flaunts an independent spirit or that suggests an immoral life-style, we want to show that we truly “glorify God.” —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> At times, one who is new, inexperienced, or spiritually weak might accept whatever the world promotes in dress and grooming without first considering how it reflects on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah and his organization. All of us might undertake some selfscrutiny to see if we have been influenced by the world’s thinking. We could approach a respected, spiritually mature brother or sister and ask for an honest observation about our style of clothing and grooming and then seriously weigh the suggestions given.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Some readily agree</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">that they should be careful about how they dress while in attendance at the convention. But then they lower their standard during leisure activities after the sessions. Maintain the high standard that befits Christian ministers. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4) Wherever we go in public, our convention badge cards along with our appropriate dress and grooming identify us as Jehovah’s Witnesses. Hence, our clothing should always be well-arranged and modest, indicating that we are “no part of the world.”—John 15:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Let us do all we can at this year’s “Zealous Kingdom Proclaimers” District Convention to prove that we are “a people holy to Jehovah [our] God.” The good impression that results will add to Jehovah’s “praise and reputation and beauty.”—Deut. 26:19.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">■ Why is there a need to exercise caution when witnessing by mail?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Giving a witness through the mail is a time-tested method of sharing the good news. Recent developments on the world scene, however, have made people cautious about opening unfamiliar mail. Envelopes from unknown sources or with no return address are often viewed with suspicion, especially if they are handwritten and bulky. Householders may discard such mail without opening it. How can we prevent this from happening?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If possible, both the letter and the envelope should be typewritten. The envelope should be addressed to the householder by name. Do not address it to “Occupant.” In addition, always provide a return address. If it is not advisable to show your personal address, give your name and the Kingdom Hall address. Do not send letters anonymously. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Never use the address of the branch office.—</span><span class="font12">See the November 1996 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> Question Box.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Does Your Congregation Have a Large Territory?</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> From the cities in Judea to the rurals of Galilee, Jesus gave an intensive witness throughout the large territory of ancient Israel. (Mark 1:38,39; Luke 23:5) We too must reach as many people as we can with the good news. (Mark 13:10) However, this can be a challenge. Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Many congregations in the United States have territory that is mostly rural, covering hundreds of square miles. Foreign-language congregations may work in populous metropolitan areas, searching for people who speak their language. What can we do to help the people living in such extensive territories to learn the truth about Jehovah, Jesus, and the Kingdom?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Plan Carefully: </span><span class="font12">The service overseer and the territory servant need to coordinate the congregation’s efforts to accomplish the most good. Perhaps special Saturdays can be scheduled when most are able to devote a full day to the work. When working distant territories, plan to spend longer days in field service if possible, taking along a lunch to enjoy at midday. You might meet for service earlier than usual to allow time for travel to the territory or hold the meeting for field service near the area to be worked. Keep car groups small so that all will stay busy. Arrange to work rural areas during seasons when weather and road conditions are favorable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Those working foreign-language territories can save valuable time by having an up-to-date list of names and addresses and a current map. Organize territories so that a service group can call on all the addresses in a general area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Be sure to take along an adequate supply of literature. If the territory is seldom worked, it may be appropriate to leave a tract or an older magazine at not-at-homes. If the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font12"> is available in your language, offer it to everyone you meet and leave one at not-at-homes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Cooperate Fully: </span><span class="font12">Working a large territory requires the cooperation of everyone in the congregation. When extensive driving is necessary, those traveling together can share gasoline expenses. Good judgment should be exercised when you find householders who are willing to talk. Be ever conscious of the need to reach all in the territory, and be considerate of those waiting in your car group. If you desire to continue a conversation with an interested person at length, could arrangements be made so that the rest of the group is not detained?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Make definite arrangements to follow up all interest. Besides the address, try to obtain the interested person’s phone number so that you can make contact and give a further witness by telephone. If rural roads are not named or houses are not numbered, carefully draw a map or write a description of how to find the interested one on the return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> What a privilege is ours to carry out Jesus’ instructions: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving”! (Matt. 10:11) Surely Jehovah will bless your efforts as you willingly give of yourself in this most rewarding work!</span></p></li></ul>
